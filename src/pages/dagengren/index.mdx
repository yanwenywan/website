# 大奉打更人 · The Nightwatchers of Feng

<Subtitle>
    By 卖报小郞君
</Subtitle>

In this world, There are Confucians, Daoists, Buddhists, Demons, and Arcanists.

Xu Qi’an, a police academy graduate, suddenly finds himself waking up in a prison, set to be exiled to the frontier three days later…

His initial goal was to protect himself in this world with no human rights and to be able to live a leisurely life as a rich man.

…

Many years later, Xu Qi’an looks back on the past, with long-dead enemies and friends, as well as the numerous bones he has left behind.

As the Yangtze River flows eastward, the waves wash away the heroes; right and wrong, success or failure will all turn into nothing but history.

However, just like the sun’s rays gleaming over the towering mountains, after each sunset, a new sun will rise.
