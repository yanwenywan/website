# 279. Can’t Bring Myself to Cut Your Head Off

“Rank 460: Yang Zhen, of the Imperial Academy. Rank 459: Li Zhuming, of Hushui Commandery, Qingzhou…”

The official standing under the "Wall of Fame" loudly announced the rankings. As soon as he began, the once noisy crowd of scholars immediately quieted down in unison.

Thousands of students pricked up their ears, listening intently. Upon hearing their own names, some burst into tears of joy, while others cheered wildly.

“Erlang, why haven’t we heard your name yet?” Auntie asked anxiously.

“Mother, they’ve only just reached the hundreds.” Xu Lingyue comforted her. “Didn’t you say Second Brother would be the _huiyuan_?”

Auntie glared at her daughter. This cheeky girl even dared to tease her.

“Erlang, they haven’t called you yet.”

When they reached the fifties, Auntie became even more nervous, her brows furrowed tightly.

“Just wait a little longer,” Xu Erlang said, frowning.

As they approached the top ten, Auntie’s face turned pale, feeling that her son was very likely to fail.

Xu Xinnian, meanwhile, was both anxious and excited. It was a moment of make-or-break. Thinking of his elder brother's poem *Ode to the Difficult Road* and his own diligent efforts, he still had a bit of confidence.

Finally, the voice called out: “This exam’s _huiyuan_, Xu Xinnian, of Cloud Deer Academy, native of the capital.”

Auntie felt a loud "boom" in her ears, like a clap of thunder. Her whole body trembled.

That same thunderous sound echoed in the ears of the thousands of scholars and Nightwatchers nearby. Their first thought was: Impossible!

It was impossible that a student of Cloud Deer Academy had become the huiyuan. The conflict between the orthodox schools of Confucianism had spanned two hundred years, and students from Cloud Deer Academy were notoriously suppressed in officialdom. This was an undisputed fact.

In such a context, how could the _huiyuan_ possibly be from Cloud Deer Academy?

The last time a student from Cloud Deer Academy achieved the title of _huiyuan_ was twenty years ago with the scholar Ziyang Jushi. But Ziyang Jushi was no ordinary person.

He was a Confucian master of the fourth rank.

Looking back twenty years later, it made sense that he had become _huiyuan_ and even the _zhuangyuan_. He was, after all, a hidden dragon.

But now, considering that this student from Cloud Deer Academy had fought his way through thousands of contenders to become _huiyuan_, could it be that he too possessed the potential of a great Confucian?

At this moment, many hearts were moved.

These were wealthy families or officials eyeing prospective sons-in-law from the examination results.

Matchmaking after the examination results had always been a tradition. Though it wasn’t as popular during the era of Yuanjing, many families still waited by the Plum List to find a suitable son-in-law.

They were looking for a scholar with outstanding talent, someone with the potential of a hidden dragon—like the _huiyuan_ Xu Xinnian.

This practice, known as list matchmaking, referred to wealthy families scouting out promising scholars after the examination results were posted. They would then send a matchmaker to the scholar’s family to propose marriage. Timing was crucial—once the match was made, the marriage was settled, and no one else could take the scholar away.

In an era where decorum and law were paramount, no one could back out of a marriage without severely jeopardizing their future, unless they were prepared to forsake their ambitions.

“Which one is Xu Xinnian?”

“Who is Xu Xinnian’s father?”

Voices of inquiry arose from the crowd.

A student turned his head and, scanning the sea of people, spotted the dazed face of Xu Xinnian. Immediately, he shouted, “Congratulations, Cijiu! Xu Xinnian is over there.”

A wave of people rushed forward, but surprisingly, it wasn’t the scholars leading the charge—it was those interested in list matchmaking, accompanied by their guards, who quickly surrounded Xu Xinnian.

“Does the _huiyuan_ Xu Xinnian have a fiancée? I have a daughter, aged sixteen, as beautiful as a flower, who would love to marry such a fine gentleman.”

“I too have an unmarried daughter at home, skilled in music, go, calligraphy, and painting.”

Xu Xinnian kept backing away.

Chun’er stood on tiptoe, watching the scene for a moment. Delighted, she said, “_List matchmaking_ is really interesting. Miss, I didn’t expect that the _huiyuan_ would be that handsome scholar.”

Before her voice had even faded, the window curtain was suddenly lifted, revealing sweet Miss Wang, with a scholarly air and a hint of baby fat on her cheeks. She peeked out for a brief moment and then said, “Chun’er, let’s head back.”

Meanwhile, Xu Xinnian, who had never seen such a commotion before, frowned.

Just as he was about to yell at the unruly crowd to back off, he noticed several shady Jianghu men pushing against the guards, trying to harass his mother and sister.

The guards were forced to retreat step by step, and Auntie and Lingyue screamed in fright.

“Stop!”

Xu Erlang shouted loudly.

But it was no use. He couldn’t stop so many people.

“Hmph, such scoundrels. No real skill, but they sure know how to take advantage of chaos,” the middle-aged swordsman observed from afar, sneering. He didn’t pay much attention though, as such small disturbances would soon be dealt with by the Nightwatchers and the constables. However, those two stunningly beautiful women might get a bit of a fright.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a deafening voice boomed. This time, it wasn’t just metaphorical thunder, but an actual explosion of sound. The thousands of people present were left dizzy and disoriented, their ears ringing.

The commotion came to an abrupt halt.

On the wall of the Examination Hall stood a young man dressed in the uniform of a Nightwatcher, with a silver gong on his chest. He rested one hand on his sword, his sharp gaze sweeping over the troublemaking Jianghu men.

At the same time, the constables and Nightwatchers finally forced their way through the crowd and arrived.

The moment Auntie saw Xu Qi’an, she felt an overwhelming sense of relief, as if she had found her anchor. Both mother and daughter sighed in relief.

“Take those troublemakers away,” Xu Qi’an commanded, pointing out the Jianghu men one by one. The nearby Bronze Gongs immediately stepped forward to apprehend them.

The scholars below recognized Xu Qi’an and were delighted, shouting, “It’s Master Poet Xu!”

“Greetings, Master Poet Xu!”

Many of the capital’s scholars greeted him with respectful salutes, as if meeting a senior or mentor.

In truth, Xu Qi’an indeed deserved such respect. With his renowned poems alone, even the proudest of scholars dared not act haughtily in his presence.

However, scholars from outside the capital didn’t know his identity. Seeing him dressed as a Nightwatcher, they initially looked down on him. But the capital scholars’ attitude made them realize this young Silver Gong was no ordinary figure.

“Brother, who is this? He looks so flamboyant, must be just a military man, right?”

“You don’t recognize him? Ah, you’re not from the capital. This gentleman is Xu Qi’an—the one who wrote *subtle fragrance drifts with the rising moon at dusk.*”

“…So it’s him. Indeed, he is a man of extraordinary presence, a true dragon among men, inspiring awe at first glance.”

With that, the scholars from outside the capital realized who he was. Xu Qi’an had many admirers, and thanks to the poems he had "borrowed," he had amassed a huge following among the scholars of the Great Feng Dynasty.

At once, countless scholars greeted him, hailing him as “Master Poet Xu.”

“So impressive…” Xu Lingyue murmured.

“So impressive…”

From afar, Miss Rongrong gazed at the young man on the wall with admiration in her eyes.

“Clearly I’m meant to be the protagonist here…” Xu Xinnian tutted softly.

…

Xu Xinnian not only passed the metropolitan exam, but ranked first as Huiyuan!

This was something no one in the family had anticipated.

Auntie was so overjoyed she nearly fainted, much like the female version of Fan Jin in that famous tale.

Second Uncle was also elated, deciding to host a grand banquet at home, inviting relatives and colleagues for a celebratory feast. Now that the Xu family was quite well-off, they could easily afford a three-day-long banquet.

After lunch, Xu Erlang set down his chopsticks, looked at Xu Qi'an, and said, "Big Brother, are you going to patrol the streets today?"

Xu Qi'an shook his head.

He was a Silver Gong, and patrolling the streets was typically at his discretion, not a mandatory duty. Besides, now that the rankings had been posted, the thousands of scholars had returned home, relieving some of the morning's security pressure.

Xu Erlang nodded, stood up, placed one hand on his abdomen, the other behind his back, and said lightly, "Then, Brother, I'll trouble you to guard the door. This afternoon, I'm sure there will be some annoying flies buzzing around. I won’t see anyone!"

His posture resembled that of a highly respected teacher or official.

*Hey, this little rascal is really getting into character...* Xu Qi'an's lips twitched.

Xu Xinnian's prideful personality was clearly inherited from Auntie. However, his sharp tongue was self-developed—Auntie's scolding skills were quite average; otherwise, she wouldn't be so easily infuriated by Xu Qi'an.

Xu Qi'an returned to his room, sat at his desk, and started pondering Xu Erlang's future.

*Erlang being named Huiyuan was beyond my expectations. Next is the palace exam in a month. After that, I can activate the back-up plan I planted (through Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Personnel)…*

*Staying in the capital is only the first step. If I want Erlang to become someone useful to me, I need to find him a solid backing. Otherwise, with his status as a student from Cloud Deer Academy, he’ll be stuck in a low-ranking post for life…*

*Duke Wei isn't the Left Censor-in-Chief anymore. I wonder if he can regain such an important position. But Erlang can’t rely on Wei Yuan. Any association with him would brand him with the same stigma as me—the ‘Eunuch Clique’.*

He frowned. *I can't put all my eggs in one basket. I need to find another patron for Erlang. Only then can we, as brothers, hope to dominate the court together.*

Xu Qi'an had once joked about grooming Xu Xinnian to become the Prime Minister of the Great Feng. While it had been a jest, he was serious about elevating Xu Erlang's position.

After everything that had happened and all the enemies he had made, this plan had become even more necessary.

First of all, Xu Erlang had exceptional talent and was following the orthodox Confucian path. He also had a decent grasp of political maneuvering. With a few years of experience, he would be an invaluable ally.

But the downside of being from the orthodox Confucian tradition was clear—he was an orphan in the political landscape.

"Princess Huaiqing, while capable, is a woman. I suspect she is secretly building her own power, but Erlang needs a strong patron, not someone leading an underground faction.

"As for the Crown Prince, after the incident with Consort Fu, I’ve fallen out with his mother, so he’s not an option. Besides, the Crown Prince’s rank is too low—he doesn’t match up with my Erlang. The Fourth Prince is similarly out of the question."

After mentally reviewing the options, Xu Qi'an realized he couldn't find a suitable patron in the civil servants.

_Sigh… This isn’t urgent. After the imperial exam, Erlang’s matters will be put on hold for now. What I need to focus on is the Buddhist envoy, and Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhens’s "Conflict of Heaven and Man"… This kind of doctrinal struggle is always troublesome,_ Xu Qi'an rubbed his temples, muttering:

"For me, though, the most important thing is to quickly advance to the Bronze Skin and Iron Bones stage."

After washing his face, Xu Qi'an left his house. As a busy Silver Gong, he had no time to stand guard for someone like Xu Erlang.

He rode his little mare, carrying the two novels Zhongli had written, and quickly made his way to the imperial city. Presenting the jade pendant gifted to him by Princess Lin'an, he was led by the Imperial Guards to Shaoyin Courtyard.

Princess Lin'an was delighted by Xu Qi'an's sudden visit, instructing her maids to serve the best tea and pastries to entertain her "Running Dog."

"How has Your Highness been lately?" Xu Qi'an asked.

Lin'an sighed, her charming peach blossom eyes dimming as she complained, "My mother consort cries to me every day, saying she’s bullied by the Empress in the palace and can hardly go on."

_What about the people backing Consort Chen? Aren’t they stepping in to help…? Hmm, Consort Chen is a capable palace schemer. She can’t be doing that poorly. She’s probably just putting on an act for Lin'an, hoping for a roundabout way to solve her problems…_ Xu Qi'an mused and then asked curiously:

"Has the Empress gone too far? Can Your Highness not stand up for Consort Chen?"

"What can I do against Huaiqing? Besides, I don't think my mother is as pitiful as she claims," Lin'an pouted, clearly feeling wronged.

"Why don’t you ask His Majesty for help?" Xu Qi'an suggested cautiously.

"Everyone, leave us," Lin'an waved her hand, dismissing the maids.

The room fell silent, with no one speaking for a long time.

"Running Dog…"

Her soft, weary voice finally broke the silence.

"Yes, Your Highness, I’m listening."

"When the Crown Prince was imprisoned in the High Court, I went to plead with Father, but he refused to see me. I stood in the cold for two hours before Huaiqing sent me away…"

Lin'an lowered her head, looking like a small, dejected animal, and said quietly, "That was when I started to think that maybe Father doesn’t love me as much as I thought. After the Crown Prince got into trouble, none of my brothers and sisters played with me anymore. That’s when I realized they never truly liked me…"

Her eyebrows drooped, and her once-clear and enchanting peach blossom eyes were now dim, her head slightly bowed. She no longer looked like a princess, but a wronged and pitiful girl.

Xu Qi'an understood that this was how much Lin’an trusted him. She was shedding the pride of a princess, revealing not a particularly foolish girl, but not too clever either.

These feelings had probably been bottled up inside her for a long time... likely since the Crown Prince’s downfall, when she first realized this harsh reality. Yet she had hidden it well, maintaining her princess’s pride.

It wasn’t until after the Consort Fu case was resolved that she fully grasped the truth behind the matter… What must her emotions have been like then? Sadness, helplessness, disappointment?

This princess, who appeared arrogant and spoiled on the outside, was in fact like a paper tiger—blustering and loud when wronged, but quietly enduring the real heartaches.

Essentially, she was a beautiful yet fragile woman, strong in appearance but weak inside.

Lin'an's eyes gradually grew misty. Speaking these words made her feel better. Even though her "Running Dog" couldn't really help her, and he hesitated even to stand up to Huaiqing on her behalf, the fact that he was willing to offend Huaiqing for her sake had already made her quite happy.

Suddenly, a hand pressed gently on her head and ruffled her hair.

Startled, Lin'an looked up, only to see that her "Running Dog" had, at some point, walked over to her side. His gaze held a mixture of pity for her misfortune and frustration at her helplessness.

"Your Highness, I’ll be here with you," he said softly.

Lin'an's face slowly turned red, and in a voice as soft as a mosquito's whisper, she murmured, "You... you shouldn't touch my head… I'll get mad."

Xu Qi'an, in complete defiance of the princess's orders, ruffled her hair even harder, messing it up entirely.

Lin'an opened her peach blossom eyes wide, glaring at him as if trying to use her royal authority to drive him away. But though her eyes were charming and full of emotion, they had no real power to intimidate.

Then, Lin'an lowered her head again.

_Hmm, for girls with this kind of personality, a mix of assertiveness and persistence works best... If it were Huaiqing, I’d probably have been stabbed by now…_

The atmosphere between them grew charged with subtle emotion.

Sensing it, Xu Qi'an withdrew his hand just in time. He reached into his robe, took out the storybook _"Great Sage of Love"_, and placed it in front of Lin'an, smiling.

"This is a book I came across by chance. It's quite interesting. Since you like stories, I think you’ll enjoy reading it. Just make sure no one knows it came from me."

Lin'an's attention immediately shifted to the book.

"If life in the palace ever gets too dull, you could always move to Lin'an Mansion. That way, I could visit you every day and even sneak you outside," he suggested playfully.

After a few more words, he prepared to take his leave.

"Xu Qi'an!" Lin'an called after him, puffing out her cheeks and threatening in a fierce but adorable tone, "Today's events must not be mentioned to anyone. Otherwise, otherwise…"

She wanted to say "I’ll have your head cut off," but she couldn’t quite bring herself to say it.

"Understood," Xu Qi'an replied with a grin.

…

After leaving Shaoyin Courtyard, Xu Qi'an approached the Imperial Guards and said, "I have urgent business with the Eldest Princess. Lead me to her."

"That's against the rules," the guard replied, shaking his head.

"I can wait outside the palace gates. That way, it'll be within the rules," Xu Qi'an said, slipping a ten-tael silver note into the guard's hand without a change in his expression.

The guard accepted and led Xu Qi'an out of the palace, letting him wait outside while he went to deliver the message.

In less than the time it took to burn a stick of incense, the guard returned and said, "Princess Huaiqing will see you."

Xu Qi'an's lips curled into a smirk as he pressed his hand to his chest, thinking to himself, _Huaiqing, oh Huaiqing, get ready to experience the power of the domineering boss and the sweet, innocent scholar routine. It’s bound to hit all your weak spots._
