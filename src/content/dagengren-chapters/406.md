# 406. Qiu Qian's Identity

“Whoosh…”

A gust of dark wind swept out from the sachet, and the temperature in the room rapidly dropped. A faintly discernible figure emerged, hovering in mid-air.

Its face was blank, eyes lifeless.

When a person dies, their Earth and Heaven souls immediately depart the body, falling into a dazed and stupefied state. The Human soul, however, remains within the body for seven days before it emerges. At that time, the Heaven and Earth souls will return to seek out the Human soul.

When all three souls reunite, the person regains their memories from life and escapes the muddled confusion.

This is the origin of the saying “the First Seven”.

*This young man’s identity is no small matter—he understands the fortune within me down to the last detail. Perhaps I can pry some crucial secrets from him…*

Xu Qi’an took a deep breath, feeling his heart race and blood boil. It had been a long time since he’d felt this excited.

At that moment, his ears twitched slightly as he caught the sound of Susu’s coquettish voice drifting in from outside the courtyard. “Aiya, you can’t go in. My husband is resting, and no one is allowed to disturb him.”

Then came Qiu Chanyi’s displeased reply, “I only want to take a quick look.”

“Daoist Chanyi may have taken a monastic oath, but surely you understand the propriety between men and women. What decent woman sneaks into a man’s room in the middle of the night?”

“Master Xu has shown great kindness to the Heaven and Earth Society—what’s wrong with me visiting him? Monastics are meant to be bright and pure, with a clear conscience.”

“Heh, clear conscience indeed. Out of all thirty-four disciples in your Heaven and Earth Society, how come you’re the only one who came? Don’t tell me it’s not because you’re lusting after him.”

“You… you… you…” Qiu Chanyi’s face flushed crimson.

“You what you? Acting all lovestruck like a little maiden. This auntie’s seen it all before. You little fillies—what you’re thinking, you think I wouldn’t know?” Susu put her hands on her waist, like a feisty little hen ready for battle.

“My husband is a notorious lecher, utterly insatiable. I’d advise you to keep your distance and guard yourself, lest you lose your maidenhood and end up abandoned. That would be rather embarrassing to speak of.”

Susu snorted. “Or perhaps… that’s exactly what Daoist Chanyi is hoping for?”

“I… I’ll go find Senior Uncle Jinlian…”

A little girl like Qiu Chanyi was no match for the wily old ghost that was Susu. Humiliated and furious, she stomped her foot and fled.

*Going to fetch Daoist Jinlian, is she…* Xu Qi’an glanced at the soul floating in the room, let out a soft sigh, and silently tucked the sachet away.

He suddenly realised he was being too hasty. There were experts like Chu Yuanzhen in the manor, all with keen senses. Even if they didn’t go out of their way to eavesdrop, just passing by could easily expose his greatest secret.

*Better to first reassure Daoist Jinlian and the others, then have Yang Qianhuan set up a soundproofing formation…* Xu Qi’an hooked the sachet back onto his waist, opened the door, and beckoned Susu over.

Susu clasped her hands behind her back, skipping into the room with a spring in her step, humming a little tune.

“It seems you’ve really taken to your role,” Xu Qi’an remarked with satisfaction.

This stunningly beautiful ghost woman, despite her constant protests, had long since embraced her identity as Xu Qi’an’s concubine in her heart—so much so that she now viewed any woman trying to seduce her husband with fierce hostility.

“I just find it incredibly satisfying to ruin your little flings and tarnish your reputation.” Susu gave a mischievous giggle, proud of herself.

Men always thought they were so clever. Here she was, revelling in the thrill of wrecking his romances, while he thought she was jealous and fighting for his affection.

Xu Qi’an’s expression darkened. Placing a hand on Susu’s shoulder, he said coolly, “Once you’ve regained a physical body, I’ll make sure you feel a very full-bodied satisfaction.”

Susu tilted her head up, sticking out her tongue in a playful grimace. That flirtatious charm was now tinged with a coquettish petulance.

As they spoke, Daoist Jinlian arrived, followed in turn by Daoist Bailian, Li Miaozhen, Chu Yuanzhen, the little dark-skinned girl from the Southern Marches, and Master Hengyuan.

Yang Qianhuan and Nangong Qianrou were absent.

“The final battle is tomorrow. We need to hold a strategy meeting. How are you feeling?” Daoist Jinlian took Xu Qi’an’s wrist, checking his pulse, his expression growing somewhat grim.

“A few days’ rest and I’ll be fine. As for tomorrow’s battle, I’m afraid…” Xu Qi’an sighed.

Right now, his physical strength had recovered, but his qi was depleted. He could fight, but not at full strength—unless his opponent also forsook their qi and fought him purely with fists and feet.

“That would be unfortunate!”

Suddenly, a figure in white flickered into the room, standing before the window, back to the others.

Yang Qianhuan’s voice drifted over, “I’ve laid out eight layers of formations, each with a focal point requiring a skilled expert to hold. I even specifically designed a defensive formation tailored to your Vajra Divine Art.”

Though they had scored a great victory during the night battle, cutting down that young master and his two peak rank four retainers, those two were unexpected extras. Meanwhile, they had lost a major force—Xu Qi’an.

Xu Qi’an considered for a moment. “Nangong Qianrou can take my place.”

Yang Qianhuan laughed dryly. “Compared to your Vajra Divine Art, a fourth rank martial artist’s physique is hardly sufficient. Don’t forget—the King Huai’s spies have cannons and ballistae.”

Daoist Jinlian shook his head. “Gold Gong Nangong was already accounted for in the plan; he’s not an unexpected bonus.”

The opposing side consisted of the Earth Sect, six fourth ranks, and a Rank Three Daoist Leader avatar; King Huai’s spies, two fourth rank martial artists, plus various other experts; and the Wulin Alliance, with a quasi-third rank top expert and numerous fourth rank sect masters and clan leaders.

On their side, confirmed fourth rank-equivalent experts included Daoist Jinlian, Daoist Bailian, Chu Yuanzhen, Li Miaozhen, Xu Qi’an, Yang Qianhuan, and Nangong Qianrou.

At a glance, the Heaven and Earth Society could barely hold its own against the Earth Sect and King Huai’s agents combined. Only with the home ground advantage and pre-laid formations did they have the confidence to resist this many forces.

In Daoist Jinlian’s plan, they only needed to hold out until the lotus seed matured—then they could abandon the manor, with no need to fight to the death.

The catch was they had to hold out first.

“Wait… whether I recover or not, wouldn’t we be unable to protect the lotus seed anyway? Even if I could ‘deter’ the independent martial artists and some of the Wulin Alliance’s fourth ranks, the allure of treasure is irresistible. Not everyone would give me face. At most, they’d hold back a little during the fight—but in the end, we’d still lose the seeds…”

As this thought crossed his mind, Xu Qi’an’s heart tensed. Something felt off.

*Daoist Jinlian—he must have some other hidden card up his sleeve.*

Even as the thought formed, Daoist Jinlian’s gentle voice rang out. “Xu Qi’an, what do you think?”

Xu Qi’an shook his head.

Daoist Jinlian’s slightly crow’s-footed eyes gazed at him warmly as he reminded, “Think it over once more.”

Xu Qi’an narrowed his eyes, staring at him. Their eyes met, seemingly calm, yet countless unspoken messages flickered between them.

*What does Daoist Jinlian mean by this… does he know my secret? Is it my fortune… or is it Shenshu?*

*The Daoist is aware of my unclear and ambiguous relationship with the Jianzheng. What he doesn’t know is that I carry the fortune of Great Feng. As I recall, when I came out of the underground palace last time, I attributed the ability to subdue the ancient corpse to the Jianzheng having left a contingency within me — which wasn’t a lie, there really is a contingency.*

*So, Daoist Jinlian believes that the Jianzheng’s “contingency” is still there? Is that the scheme he’s been pursuing all along? No wonder he’s so calm — the Daoist thinks I can erupt with the combat power of a top-level expert, just like I did in the underground palace.*

*Or… perhaps Daoist Jinlian already knows that Shenshu resides within me. The “mysterious master” of Chuzhou is indeed mysterious to outsiders, but to certain insiders, it doesn’t withstand scrutiny.*

*For instance, Daoist Jinlian was involved in the Sangpo case and knows the sealed artefact was connected to the Buddhist sects. He’s also particularly familiar with me. Plus, the boasting I did in front of the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect was heard by tens of thousands.*

*Phew… fortunately, the Daoist isn’t part of Great Feng’s officialdom; otherwise, I’d be in real trouble…* Xu Qi’an sighed.

“I truly have no plan — I’m powerless.”

Firstly, the Monk Shenshu was asleep and could be awakened, so that trump card was temporarily out of play. As for the Jianzheng, that old man is cunning and unfathomable, a truly terrifying figure — someone entirely beyond Xu Qi’an’s control.

So, he really was out of cards and options.

Daoist Jinlian’s gaze dimmed slightly, and he remained silent for a long while.

After a good while, he sighed. “So be it. What’s done is done; all we can do now is leave it to fate.”

Upon hearing this, everyone sighed.

“Oh, right…”

Suddenly, Daoist Jinlian turned to Chu Yuanzhen. “Did you inform Luo Yuheng about this matter as I asked?”

Chu Yuanzhen glanced at him, puzzled as to why the Daoist was specifically bringing this up, but still nodded. “Of course, I passed it on.”

Daoist Jinlian quickly asked, “Did she say anything?”

“The National Teacher only said ‘take care’.” Chu Yuanzhen’s expression was calm — the National Teacher was always a cold and detached woman, not the type to leave extensive instructions.

Daoist Jinlian frowned, a mix of anticipation and urgency in his expression. “Did… did she give you anything?”

Chu Yuanzhen was taken aback. “Daoist, how did you even guess that… The National Teacher did indeed give me a protective talisman.”

“Hurry, hurry, bring it out.”

Daoist Jinlian urged repeatedly, his excitement and eagerness plain for all to see.

Chu Yuanzhen frowned slightly and took out a yellow talisman folded into a charm and threaded with a red string. “It’s just an ordinary protective charm with no special properties…”

In truth, Chu Yuanzhen was reluctant to show it — it was a token from the National Teacher, a gesture from a senior figure, something personal.

Daoist Jinlian reached out, took the charm, and a trace of relief flickered in his eyes. Then, he did something that left everyone in the room stunned.

“Xu Qi’an, take this charm.”

Chu Yuanzhen: “???”

Everyone turned to look at Xu Qi’an.

“Daoist, why give it to me?” Xu Qi’an looked bewildered.

*Daoist, Chu Yuanzhen looks like he wants to eat me alive — look at his eyes, just look at them…*

Daoist Jinlian seemed to revert to his usual shrewd and cunning self, smiling as he said, “Don’t ask. You’ll know tomorrow. Mm, you’ll stand guard outside the pool for the final stage.”

The baffled Xu Qi’an received a voice transmission from Daoist Jinlian: “In a critical moment, burn the charm to summon her aid.”

*Summon… Luo Yuheng? Don’t be ridiculous, Daoist — my relationship with my kind aunt is nowhere near that close. She’s already given me a talisman sword, which is more than enough face. How could I trouble her again and again…*

*You’re putting me in a tight spot, Daoist!* Xu Qi’an wanted to wave his hands and say: “We’re not that close, we’re not that close!”

But knowing that LYB as well as he did, Xu Qi’an understood that Daoist Jinlian wouldn’t make such a decision unless he was confident.

*What is Daoist Jinlian thinking… why would he give the National Teacher’s charm to Xu Qi’an…* Chu Yuanzhen frowned deeply, feeling insulted.

But being a wise and composed man, adept at analysis (wild speculation), he shifted to thinking about the Daoist’s motives, launching into an internal brainstorming session.

Li Miaozhen and Master Hengyuan were also puzzled, but they didn’t dwell on it too much.

That wasn’t because they were dumb — they simply didn’t like overthinking things.

Lina, however, was genuinely dumb. She had no intention of thinking at all, treasuring her brain cells like precious gems.

At this moment, Qiu Chanyi came in with several female disciples, carrying steaming dishes. The delicious aroma instantly filled the room.

Chicken soup, braised pig trotters, steamed river prawns, cornbread, steamed lamb, braised pork… the table was soon heaving with food.

“Gulp…”

Xu Qi’an and Lina swallowed their saliva in unison.

“Master Xu, the kitchen prepared this especially for you — they’ve been waiting for you to wake up and eat.” Qiu Chanyi said crisply.

“Yes, yes, Chanyi made it herself.” One of the female disciples covered her mouth, laughing.

Qiu Chanyi’s cheeks flushed red.

Xu Qi’an quickly offered his thanks, then awkwardly glanced at Daoist Jinlian and Daoist Bailian, noticing they remained calm and unbothered by their disciple’s affection.

“Well, we won’t disturb you then.” Daoist Jinlian nodded and was the first to leave.

Chu Yuanzhen and the others followed.

Lina stayed behind — her legs were still sealed, her bright blue eyes gazing longingly at Xu Qi’an.

“Let’s eat together.”

Xu Qi’an said helplessly, then picked up a cornbread roll, pairing it with braised pork and lamb.

“Sir Xu, how does it taste?” Qiu Chanyi asked expectantly, lips pursed.

“Sister Chanyi’s cooking is excellent.”

Xu Qi’an gave her a thumbs up, then sighed. “It’s just that your tea-brewing skills are lacking.”

“My tea-making is good too!” Qiu Chanyi protested, feeling wronged.

Master Xu hasn’t even tasted her tea, yet he’s already so dismissive… She pouted, feeling that Master Xu had underestimated her.

“I was talking about green tea.”[^1]

Xu Qi’an said with a smile, “I’ve got a younger sister at home, about your age, but her tea-making skills are far superior to yours. When there’s a chance, I’ll introduce you to her so you can learn from her.”

Susu belonged to the seductive, bewitching kind of \*\*\*\*[^2] — and this type could only be countered by green tea girls.

If it had been Lingyue just now, she’d have burst into tears right on the spot, then “aggrievedly” stood guard outside for the whole night, and if she could catch a cold from it, even better.

Afterwards, Susu would be firmly labelled as a “vile ghost”.

Once the meal was finished, Xu Qi’an dismissed Qiu Chanyi and the other women, then called out into the courtyard: “Senior Brother Yang!”

The white-clad figure answered the call, his back to him, leisurely saying: “If heaven birthed not I, Yang Qianhuan…”

*We’re all so familiar now, there’s really no thrill left in posturing…* Xu Qi’an interrupted coldly: “The Great Feng will be a night that never ends.”

Yang Qianhuan choked for a moment, then asked icily: “What do you want?”

“I’d like to trouble Senior Brother Yang to carve me a soundproof formation, one that can also block divinations if possible. I’m about to do something highly confidential.” Xu Qi’an said bluntly.

“Heh, you’re not afraid I’ll eavesdrop?” Yang Qianhuan asked mockingly.

“Heh, I trust no one — except Senior Brother Yang. Senior Brother Yang is the most noble and virtuous person in history.” Xu Qi’an said earnestly.

“You’ve got a good eye.” Yang Qianhuan was quite pleased.

…

Inside the room, Xu Qi’an shut the doors and windows, opened the scented pouch, and once again released Qiu Qian’s soul.

A chilling wind rose, and the room’s temperature dropped.

Qiu Qian floated blankly in the air like a foolish young master from a wealthy family.

“What’s your name?” Xu Qi’an tentatively asked.

“Ji Qian.”

Qiu Qian replied woodenly.

Xu Qi’an pondered for a moment to choose his words, then asked, “What’s your real identity?”

“The Great Feng royal family.”

Qiu Qian’s voice didn’t change in tone, but it triggered a tempest in Xu Qi’an’s mind, a tidal wave that shook the very ground beneath him.

*He’s from the imperial clan of Great Feng?! No wonder his surname is Ji. Wait — is there such a figure in the imperial clan?*

Countless thoughts flashed through his mind as Xu Qi’an forced himself to calm down, asking in a low voice: “Which branch?”

The reason he asked was because he was sure there was no such person in the capital’s imperial family. The Great Feng dynasty had lasted for six hundred years, with countless descendants and branches. This Ji Qian was either from a side branch or an illegitimate child of some noble.

Hence the question — which branch?

Qiu Qian muttered, “The orthodox lineage from five hundred years ago.”

Xu Qi’an almost lost control of his expression, his arm trembling violently.

*The orthodox lineage from five hundred years ago — in other words, he’s a descendant of the previous emperor, the one slain by Emperor Wuzong? That emperor’s bloodline still exists? Wasn’t it said they were all wiped out by treacherous officials…*

*Well, of course — that period of history must have been rewritten. Historical records can’t be trusted. But a formidable sovereign like Emperor Wuzong wouldn’t have left loose ends.*

“What was your status within the clan?”

“I was my father’s legitimate son.”

“Who’s your father?”

“His name is Ji Xiao. He will become the overlord of all Jiuzhou and replace Emperor Yuanjing…”

*The orthodox lineage from five hundred years ago has returned for revenge? I killed a ‘Crown Prince’…* Xu Qi’an was stunned for a long while, struggling to digest this earth-shattering revelation.

Then, he continued asking: “What’s the deal with the fortune on me?”

He decided not to ask directly about the Ji clan’s affairs just yet, steering the conversation straight to the core issue.

“……” Qiu Qian remained silent.

*I got a bit ahead of myself…* Xu Qi’an took a deep breath: “What’s the deal with the fortune on Xu Qi’an?”

“The fortune was stored by that great master within him. It is the cornerstone of our grand plan, the key to opposing the Jianzheng, the most crucial step in our bid for supremacy over the Central Plains.”

As he said this, Qiu Qian’s usually blank expression showed rare traces of vividness.

It was as though this matter was seared into his very soul.

“Who is that great master?” Xu Qi’an’s lips trembled.

The next question almost escaped his lips — *why was the fortune placed on me?*

At this moment, Qiu Qian’s face contorted, showing visible struggle and conflict.

…

The night was tranquil, with the faint chirping of insects.

On the hillside outside the dense forest, a few wolves were gnawing on corpses, growling low in warning to deter their peers.

A pair of white boots descended from the air, landing lightly beside Qiu Qian’s headless corpse.

It was a man dressed all in white, as pale as snow. His white clothes and shoes contrasted starkly with his jet-black hair. His face was shrouded in layers of mist, as if he didn’t belong to this world.

His presence was faint to the extreme — he hadn’t made any effort to mask his arrival, yet the wolves around him kept eating, utterly unaware of the white figure’s presence.

The white figure lowered his head, glanced dispassionately at the mangled corpse, then shifted his gaze towards the Yue Clan Manor.

He watched for a long while, then chuckled softly.
