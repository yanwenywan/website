In the reception hall, Xu Qi’an sat quietly with a cup of tea poured by a servant girl, a cloth sack standing at his feet, as tall as his knee.

After a few minutes of silence, his ears picked up a faint sound of clinking scales. Moments later, he saw Chu Xianglong stride across the threshold, entering straight into the room.

“My thanks to General Chu and the Duke of Cao for your assistance.”

Xu Qi’an’s tone was hardly sincere—he didn’t even bother to stand up, taking a sip of tea as he spoke.

Chu Xianglong didn’t mind. He looked Xu Qi’an over and then cast his gaze down to the cloth sack at his feet. “Is it here?”

Xu Qi’an set down his teacup, opened the sack, and revealed a stone-carved Buddha statue with crude, amateurish craftsmanship.

Chu Xianglong’s eyes blazed with interest, staring intently at the statue. Despite its rough appearance and barely defined features, it emanated a faint sense of Buddhist aura, subtly giving away its underlying magic.

“I’ve inscribed the essence of the Vajra Body technique into the Buddha statue. Whether or not you can master it is your concern,” Xu Qi’an said.

“Of course.”

Chu Xianglong withdrew his gaze, nodded with satisfaction. “You’re a man of your word.”

*Ha, if I weren’t, you’d probably just say, ‘You, a mere Silver Gong, dare to go back on your word? Not even Wei Yuan could protect you!’* Xu Qi’an sneered inwardly but maintained a calm facade. “Actually, this technique is worth next to nothing to me. If you’d just offered five hundred taels, General Chu, I would’ve sold it outright and saved us all the trouble.”

Chu Xianglong stepped forward, wrapped the Buddha statue back in the cloth sack, and lifted it with a look of mockery and scorn. 

“I wouldn’t spend five hundred taels on something I could obtain with a little trickery. Of course, the Buddhist Vajra Body technique is worth a fortune.” He gave a slight nod and added, “Safe travels, Silver Gong Xu. I won’t see you out.”

*So the Vajra Body is priceless, but I’m not worth spending money on, huh?* Xu Qi’an remained unfazed, smiling. “Green mountains are constant, and rivers run long.”

With that, he turned and walked out.

He was passing through the courtyard when a maid approached him in a hurry. “Are you Xu Qi’an, Silver Gong Xu?”

“Yes, that’s me,” Xu Qi’an nodded.

“My Lady, the Princess Consort, wishes to see you,” said the maid.

*The Zhenbei Princess Consort wants to see me? The famed number one beauty of the Great Feng wants to see me? I could get used to this…* Xu Qi’an was quite curious about the woman renowned for her beauty.

*It’s just a meeting, nothing to worry about…* Xu Qi’an smiled. “Please lead the way, sister.”

The maid led Xu Qi’an through winding corridors, past courtyards and gardens, until they finally arrived at their destination—a pavilion with curtains hanging down on all sides.

Through the drapes, he could just make out a graceful silhouette reclining on a lounge, holding a book.

Xu Qi’an strained to see her face, only to realize there was an additional veil within the pavilion.

“So, you’re Xu Qi’an?”

A mature woman’s voice, both cool and magnetic, came from within the pavilion.

Even though he couldn’t see her face, her voice was enchanting. Xu Qi’an cupped his hands. “What does the Princess Consort wish of me?”

The woman inside the pavilion scoffed coldly. “I heard that you blocked a hundred officials outside the Meridian Gate, mocking them with poetry. Is this true?”

Xu Qi’an replied, “I am young and reckless; it was a moment of impulsiveness. Shameful, shameful.”

*Can you even feel shame? Hah!* The woman inside the pavilion paused for a moment, then said indifferently, “See him out.”

*That’s it?* Xu Qi’an looked at the pavilion, a bit bewildered, then turned to follow the maid out.

Just then, a gold ingot flew out of the pavilion and hit Xu Qi’an square on the back with a thud.

“Why did the Princess Consort throw this at me?”

Xu Qi’an turned, glanced down at the gold on the ground. He hadn’t sensed any danger, which meant there was no threat involved, but he was a bit irked.

The woman in the pavilion gave him no response.

A hint of curiosity flashed in Xu Qi’an’s eyes. Seeing that the Princess Consort offered no explanation, he bent down to pick up the gold and pocketed it without hesitation.

“If the Princess Consort plans to throw anything at me in the future, please make sure it is also a gold brick.”

With a final jab, Xu Qi’an followed the maid and left.

…

In the quiet of his chamber, Chu Xianglong shut all the doors and windows tightly. He set the stone-carved Buddha statue on the table, concentrating on it intently for a long while. He could feel a distinct flow of Buddhist aura, mysterious and profound.

But no matter how much he tried to comprehend, he could not extract the technique from it.

“The Buddhist Vajra Body indeed requires a certain affinity, as well as a foundation in Buddhist teachings. Xu Qi’an has some talent to have achieved the Unbreakable Vajra. But still, he’s just a nobody; a slight trick was enough to make him fall in line.”

Chu Xianglong smirked, both satisfied and disdainful.

A so-called martial prodigy, a talent said to rival the Zhenbei King. If not for the Jianzheng’s hidden assistance, how could he have fought against a Buddhist arhat?

Of all the rumors circulating in the capital, the ones Chu Xianglong despised the most were those comparing Xu Qi’an to his liege.

A mere bailiff turned Silver Gong, the lowly son of a military household—he’s not worthy!

“The Vajra Body aside, there’s little left to squeeze out of him. Otherwise, I would’ve squeezed every last bit of silver from him.”

Chu Xianglong and the Duke of Cao had planned to obtain the Vajra Body for a reason. Given their status, rank, and insight, how could they be oblivious to the profundity of the technique?

In his youth, Chu Xianglong had served in the army, and during an expedition against roving bandits, he once encountered a wandering monk from the Western Regions.

The monk had tried to enlighten the famished bandits with Buddhist teachings but was captured by them, with plans to cook and eat him.

Chu Xianglong had saved the monk, and in gratitude, the monk had given him a bronze amulet etched with Buddhist scriptures. Whenever Chu wore the amulet, he felt a sense of calm, as if his hostility and rage melted away, entering a state of enlightenment.

After each fierce battle, Chu Xianglong would wear it, dissipating his aggression and contemplating the mysterious profundities of Buddhism.

“Creak…”

He opened the bedside cabinet and took out a small sandalwood box. Lifting the lid, he saw a bronze talisman the size of his palm wrapped in red silk.

“Though I’m not one of the Buddhist sect, this talisman is incredibly mysterious. It helps me enter a meditative state, which may allow me to grasp the profundities of the Vajra Divine Art.

“If I can master the Invincible Vajra, my strength on the battlefield will increase exponentially. Above all, a body far surpassing that of an average warrior will allow me to survive better in combat.

"Moreover, if I can use the bronze talisman to master the Vajra Divine Art, His Highness will surely reward me handsomely."

With that thought, a fervent light gleamed in Chu Xianglong’s eyes, and he was eager to delve into the Buddha statue’s mysteries.

Taking a deep breath, he took the time of a cup of tea to calm his mind, quieting his heart and thoughts.

Then, he grasped the bronze talisman and began to meditate.

Gradually, he felt a vast, serene aura that cleared his mind, allowing him to calmly scrutinize his seven emotions and six desires, undisturbed by stray thoughts.

Once he achieved this state, Chu Xianglong opened his eyes, focusing intently on the Buddha’s aura emanating from the statue.

This time, he distinctly saw the statue move, shifting into various postures, each accompanied by a unique technique of energy circulation.

*It really works…* Overjoyed, Chu Xianglong almost lost his “detached” state.

Instinctively, he attempted to imitate the statue’s postures and the unique method of circulating his energy.

A golden sheen appeared at the center of his brow, swiftly spreading over half his body.

Suddenly… a surge of energy burst within him, like a volcanic eruption, tearing through his meridians and dantian.

“Pfft!”

Chu Xianglong spat out a mouthful of blood as veins burst across his body. His dantian was shattered by the violent energy, and he was grievously injured.

His face turned crimson, beads of sweat rolling down as he looked at his body in shock, watching as the golden sheen gradually faded from his arms.

“How could this happen… even with the bronze talisman…?” The thought flickered through Chu Xianglong’s mind before he collapsed unconscious.

An hour later, one of his trusted aides came looking for him and finally discovered his master, barely clinging to life, lying unconscious.

"Assassin! There’s been an assassin…!"

…

After hearing the guard’s report, the Zhenbei Princess Consort suppressed her delight and asked, “A Qi deviation while practicing martial arts? He’s perfectly healthy, how did that happen?”

The guard shook his head. “This humble servant doesn’t know.”

The Princess Consort’s joy was barely concealed as she asked, “Did he die?”

The guard shook his head again. “His life is not in danger, but he’s severely wounded. The arcanists from Sitianjian say he’ll be bedridden for a month before recovering. Furthermore, due to the late discovery, his energy flow reversed, breaking all his meridians, so he might be left with chronic injuries.”

Princess Consort’s face fell in disappointment.

“However, this servant has heard it might be related to the Buddha statue sent by Silver Gong Xu.” The guard hesitated before adding.

*So it’s connected to him? That rascal has actually done something to gladden the heart…* thought the Princess Consort with a gleeful smile.

…

On a rugged mountain path, Li Miaozhen, dressed in Daoist robes with her hair bound by a jade crown, walked with a sword gifted by her sect strapped to her back.

The roadside was ablaze with wildflowers under the bright sun. The mountains were serene, the water clear, and she took in the sights with a contented heart.

Beside her trailed a scarlet oil-paper umbrella. Beneath it was the strikingly beautiful Susu, her ink-black eyes, vivid red lips, and snow-white skin framed by an elaborate, luxurious gown.

Li Miaozhen’s beauty was breathtaking, but her presence was too fierce.

In contrast, Susu appeared every bit the exquisite and elegant noblewoman, her alluring gaze filled with an elusive charm.

“We’re eighty li from the capital, Mistress. Shall we stay there for a while?” Susu looked south with anticipation.

“I’m not familiar with Sitianjian, and with Xu Qi'an gone, you really think Song Qing will bother with you?” Li Miaozhen scoffed, not sparing her companion’s feelings.

“Then…” Susu’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “I’ll just say I’m Xu Qi'an’s fiancée.”

Li Miaozhen gave a cold snort. “Perfect. Then they’ll perform a blessing and send you to join him in the afterlife.”

Pouting, Susu stopped at the roadside. “Fine, I’m going back to the Heaven Sect. I’m going back!”

Her petulant stance could melt any man’s heart… if Li Miaozhen were a man. Instead, she swatted the back of Susu’s head. “Are you going or not?”

Susu obediently quieted down. “Fine, just don’t hit my head so much; it’s all going flat.”

At that moment, Li Miaozhen sniffed the air, her face turning solemn. “I smell blood.”

After a brief survey of the area, she focused her gaze on a patch of grass ahead.
