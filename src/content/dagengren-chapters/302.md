# 302. Treat Oneself Strictly

Tower of Noble Spirit

Jiang Lyuzhong sat at the table, holding the tea brought by the clerk. Blowing on it to cool it down, he took a sip, and remarked:

"I remember having tea here with Duke Wei last year. It was refreshing to the mind, and the fragrance lingered on my lips for six hours."

Standing in front of the bookshelf, flipping through books, Wei Yuan, with his back to him, said lightly, "That was tribute tea from the palace, only three pounds are produced every three years, and even His Majesty rarely drinks it."

*No wonder...* Jiang Lyuzhong suddenly understood and curiously asked, "Such a miraculous tea, where is it grown?"

"It’s grown in the capital."

"The capital has such fine tea? How come I’ve never heard of it?"

"A woman grows it. She’s in the capital, so the tea comes from the capital," Wei Yuan’s voice was gentle and mellow.

Jiang Lyuzhong nodded and didn’t ask further. Although the tea was good, he, being a warrior, wasn’t particularly passionate about tea. He came to the Tower of Noble Spirit today with a clear and specific purpose.

"Today, I heard Ningyan mention something. He’s very popular in the Jiaofangsi, beloved by the oiran, and for a good reason," Jiang Lyuzhong said.

"Beauties love poetry, especially women of the night," Wei Yuan chuckled.

"It’s not just that," Jiang Lyuzhong shook his head. “Besides poetry, he has two other secrets: 'Deep words without deep connections' and 'Are you able to?' I've pondered these for a long time but gained no insights... Of course, it’s not that I want to become that kind of person, I’m just curious.

"With your vast knowledge, Duke Wei, both in celestial matters and earthly geography, I came especially to seek your guidance. Surely, with your wisdom, you understand it well."

After speaking, Jiang Lyuzhong saw Wei Yuan turn around and gaze at him deeply.

After ten seconds of silent staring, Wei Yuan looked away and casually said, "Lyuzhong, you've been with me for nearly ten years, haven’t you?"

"Yes."

"For these ten years, you've been diligent and conscientious. I’ve seen it all and am quite pleased." Wei Yuan pulled out a book and said, "Alright, I need to continue reading. You may leave."

Jiang Lyuzhong left in confusion, returning to his post.

Before he had even settled down, a clerk came in, bowed, and said, "Gold Gong Jiang, Duke Wei has given an order."

"But he just sent me away…" Jiang Lyuzhong asked, "What’s the matter?"

"Duke Wei said that Gold Gong Jiang has been diligent and conscientious and should continue to maintain that. For the next month, all night shifts are assigned to you."

After a pause, the clerk continued, "Duke Wei also said he hopes Gold Gong Jiang will pack up and move into the constabulary. You don’t need to go home for the time being."

"???"

*Is this the kind of order for a diligent and conscientious subordinate? Is this human speech? A full month of night duty? Doesn’t that mean I won’t be able to visit Jiaofangsi or even see any women for the next month!?*

Jiang Lyuzhong was dumbfounded.

...

Xu Qi'an waited for two hours. Two full hours.

Luckily, he hadn’t drunk too much water, or it would’ve been embarrassing… The sun wasn’t strong enough to highlight his sense of desolation… He waited patiently, without complaint or urging.

However, Xu Qi'an did notice that every quarter of an hour, a palace maid would sneakily stand in the courtyard, peeking toward the door.

Xu Qi'an pretended not to notice.

The sun shone brightly, the spring breeze was warm, and after the start of spring, the back garden of Shaoyin Courtyard began to awaken, gradually revealing its beautiful and charming side.

Likewise, the Second Princess Lin'an, who had alluring peach blossom eyes and a charming, flirtatious temperament, sat angrily in the pavilion, instructing her two personal maids on how to play Go.

After playing for a while, she had developed a fondness for teaching others how to play.

The two maids had no enjoyment in the game, but they dared not disobey the Second Princess, who was in a bad mood.

"Princess, Sir Xu is still waiting outside," a young maid came to report at regular intervals.

Lin'an responded with a composed "Mm," and there was no follow-up.

The maid withdrew.

After another quarter of an hour, she checked again and saw that Sir Xu was still there, which touched her heart.

*Our princess always throws tantrums. Isn’t she just pushing Sir Xu toward Princess Huaiqing…?* This thought crossed her mind as she saw Sir Xu suddenly sway and fall to the ground, unconscious.

"Aiya…"

The young maid panicked and rushed over to check. She saw that Sir Xu’s face was pale, and he was frowning in pain.

"Sir Xu, Sir Xu?" The young maid anxiously shook him, on the verge of tears.

Xu Qi'an "weakly" regained consciousness. He clutched his chest, coughed a few times, and waved his hand, saying, "I'm fine, it’s nothing. It’s just that my injuries from yesterday’s duel were severe, and I stood for too long. My wounds have reopened, but I'll be fine after some rest."

The young maid, both pained and moved, advised, "Sir Xu, you should go back first. The Second Princess is in a bad mood and won’t see you."

"Her Highness is upset?"

Xu Qi'an was taken aback and asked, "What happened? Who upset her?"

The young maid was momentarily at a loss, thinking to herself, *Aren’t you the one who upset her?*

She quietly replied, "The guards at Shaoyin Courtyard saw Sir Xu entering the palace and going to Dexin Courtyard."

Xu Qi'an fell silent.

Seeing that he didn’t explain, the maid was a bit disappointed and urged, "Sir Xu, please leave for now. Come back when Her Highness is no longer angry."

After saying that, she left Xu Qi'an and entered the courtyard.

She hurried to the inner garden pavilion and urgently said, "Your Highness, Sir Xu just fainted."

Lin'an suddenly raised her head, a mixture of surprise and concern flashing across her face before she quickly suppressed it. She coolly asked, "Fainted?"

"Sir Xu said it was because he stood too long and his injuries from yesterday’s duel reopened," the young maid said with her head down.

"I didn’t ask him to wait… You two fools can’t even play Go properly," Lin'an angrily scolded before turning to the maid, "If he hasn’t left yet, invite him in."

…

Xu Qi'an was brought to a side hall, where he drank cup of hot tea and waited for a long time before finally seeing the familiar figure in red walk in. She had a round face with delicate features, though her expression was cold. Her enchanting eyes feigned indifference as she scolded, “Did I not say I wouldn’t see guests? Why did you let him in?”

With those words, Lin'an's gaze fell on Xu Qi'an. After inspecting him, she seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and ordered, “Since Sir Xu has served the court well, we cannot let you suffer for nothing. He'er, bring the items in.”

The palace maid, whom Xu Qi'an had once playfully smacked, retreated and soon returned with other servants, carrying medicinal pills and tonics.

“These medicinal herbs and pills were taken from the Imperial Pharmacy. Sir Xu, please take them,” Lin'an said with measured dignity.

“Her Majesty had to plead for a long time before His Majesty reluctantly allowed it,” He'er added.

“Who asked you to speak?” Biaobiao's delicate brows shot up, but after taking a deep breath, she composed herself. “He'er, show our guest out.”

Xu Qi'an did not leave.

A standoff ensued for a moment. Thick-skinned as ever, Xu Qi'an grinned and said, “I’ve studied the game of five-in-a-row for a long time and devised an unbeatable strategy. Would Your Highness dare to challenge me?”

Biaobiao, predictably falling for the bait, agreed.

Thus, a maid brought over the board and pieces, and she and Xu Qi'an engaged in a fierce game. Three rounds later, Xu Qi'an was defeated each time, leaving him with no choice but to concede.

“Your Highness is truly brilliant. I am in awe,” Xu Qi'an smoothly flattered.

Lin'an raised her chin slightly and responded with a reserved “hmm.” But just as she was feeling pleased, she recalled the man’s usual ingratitude and added with a huff, “We’ve finished the game. We won’t keep you any longer.”

“Wait, I just thought of a new game. If Your Highness is interested, I can teach you,” Xu Qi'an teased, playing his old tricks.

The once-quiet Shaoyin Courtyard suddenly became lively as Biaobiao began directing the guards to chop wood while Xu Qi'an split the logs into smaller sections.

“You, go fetch the dye… And you, bring the carving tools...” Biaobiao commanded the guards and maids with a smile on her face, her enthusiasm evident.

As the maids left, they whispered to each other:

“The princess was furious not too long ago, even throwing her teacup. Her eyes were red with anger... Yet look at Sir Xu. He didn’t even say a word of apology, and she’s already forgiven him.”

“She was just venting. It’s not as if she’s truly mad at Sir Xu. Mark my words, if he left, then she’d really be heartbroken.”

“Ahem ahem!” came a low cough from behind them. Startled, the two maids jumped like frightened deer, turning to see Xu Qi'an standing behind them.

“Sir Xu, how could you scare us like that?” He'er complained.

Xu Qi'an bantered with the maids for a moment before getting to the point. “Tell me, those pills are worth a city, when did her Highness prepare them?”

“They are the Emperor’s personal supply, meant for replenishing qi and vitality. It’s said that a successful batch produces only twenty-four pills. The princess had to plead with His Majesty all night yesterday before he finally relented and gave her one,” He'er explained.

“And this morning, she immediately sent someone to fetch you, only to find...” another maid added before trailing off.

“Off with you now!” Xu Qi'an playfully swatted them on the buttocks and sent the maids away.

Returning to his task, he began carving the logs into flat discs. Lin'an joined him, and despite her limited abilities, she could still manage simple carving.

Unbeknownst to them, the afternoon passed quickly, and by the time the sun began to set, Xu Qi'an had finished crafting a set of Chinese chess!

Looking at the chess set they had made together, Biaobiao's face lit up with a genuine smile, a smile so radiant that it seemed to outshine the flowers.

“It’s getting late. I’ll explain the rules to Your Highness, then I’ll need to take my leave,” Xu Qi'an said, dismissing the maids with a wave.

Biaobiao glanced at the setting sun, her smile fading as she nodded quietly.

Xu Qi'an carefully explained the rules of xiangqi, but Biaobiao seemed distracted. She had been furious earlier, and though she had to admit that her initial attraction to Xu Qi'an was born out of a desire to take something away from Huaiqing, she had grown fond of him over time. She gave him silver, treated him with sincerity, and asked for nothing in return except that he spend time with her.

However, she could never shake the thorn in her heart—his ongoing “inappropriate” relationship with Huaiqing. 

Though he had promised to serve her, he continued to meet with Huaiqing in secret. She tried to ignore it, but today, after enduring her father's scolding and humiliation just to secure a pill for him, she had reached her limit when she heard her guard’s report: *He’s gone to Dexin Courtyard.*

For a fleeting moment, Lin'an felt utterly disrespected. She felt that she had been trodden over, that Xu Qi’an had never even treated her with a mote of importance — even treating her as an idiot.

So hurt that she cried.

“Alas...” 

Xu Qi'an suddenly sighed, and whispered: “Your Highness, earlier I went to Dexin Courtyard.”

Biaobiao’s expression suddenly collapsed, and she turned her head: “I don’t know a Dexin Courtyard. After you entered the palace, you came to find me.”

“No, I went to see Princess Huaiqing first.”

“Xu Qi’an!”

Biaobiao shouted, turning back, her eyes red. *He even wants to tear down a lie I wanted to believe myself, does he care about my feelings.*

Xu Qi’an sighed again, his eyes looking far towards the setting sun, his expression becoming deep and melancholy, as if reflecting a countless number of years and experiences.

One word at a time, he slowly said: “Your Highness, do you know what they say?”

Lin'an remained silent.

"Throughout life, you will encounter many scenes and meet many people, but the final choice you make is what your heart truly desires."

Biaobiao was momentarily stunned, staring blankly at him.

"Today, both Your Highness and Princess Huaiqing invited me at the same time, and without hesitation, I went to see Princess Huaiqing first. Why? It’s not because she holds more importance in my heart than you."

Xu Qi’an stood up, his expression somewhat animated. “If I had come to Shaoyin Pavilion first, I wouldn’t have been able to stay long. After exchanging a few words, I’d have to leave and go to Dexin Pavilion. Ha, could I really ignore Princess Huaiqing’s invitation?

"But if I go to Dexin Pavilion first, I can stay here with Your Highness until the palace gates close. Isn't it clear who holds more weight in my heart?"

Biaobiao's gaze gradually softened, her expression shifting from cold to gentle.

Xu Qi’an sat down again, looking at Lin’an with the same profound gaze he had when watching the setting sun. In a soft voice, he said, “Because I know, Your Highness, that what you need is companionship.”

This statement hit the softest spot in Biaobiao's heart. Yes, she was lonely, isolated.

After the Crown Prince was confined, her mother constantly came to her in tears, filling her head with suspicions about the Empress. Her siblings grew increasingly distant as well.

Her father, the Emperor, was still the Emperor. But Lin’an was no longer the same. She had realized that her father’s affection was only because she was harmless.

On the outside, she was a charming, proud princess, but deep inside, she was a lonely, isolated girl.

Xu Qi’an glanced around to ensure that the palace maids he had dismissed earlier were nowhere near. Then he boldly held Lin’an’s soft hand, his tone sincere:

“Your Highness, I will always be by your side.”

The warmth from his hand felt almost scalding. Lin’an’s cheeks flushed red, and a warm sensation seemed to flow through her heart.

Time quietly passed as Xu Qi’an held her hand, not letting go, and a sense of intimacy and ambiguity brewed between them.

“Your Highness, it’s getting late. I should take my leave. If you wish to see me every day, you could move to Lin’an Manor instead of staying in the palace,” Xu Qi’an said in a low voice.

...

In the fading light of the setting sun, Xu Qi’an sat on his little mare, clop-clopping through the imperial city.

“Little mare, based on my many years of experience wooing girls, now that I’ve held Lin’an’s hand, next time I’ll be able to hug her... Girls, after all, must be pursued. If you don’t chase them, they’ll never be yours.

“I once heard a joke about a lecher who told his girlfriend: 'Your parents treat you well because you’re their daughter, but only I love you genuinely.'

“Although it’s nonsense, I feel like there’s some truth in it. Lin’an’s affection for me is pure and sincere, with no ulterior motives or self-interest. Of course, the latter might be more reflective of the adult world.

“Even though she’s a bit foolish, she’s a beautiful vase, and she’s emptied herself to be kind to me.

“As for who’s most suitable to be a wife, it's still Chu Caiwei. Eating her soft rice is the best, with no side effects. Lin’an and Huaiqing are much more dangerous.

"To be honest, with my current status, I don’t have many demands for women. I just hope they can strictly avoid any green tendencies."[^1]

At this point, the little mare nudged him with her head and snorted twice.

"Do you want me to set expectations for you too?"

Xu Qi’an thought for a moment and said, "For you, hmm... don’t let small fish slip by!"

...

At Wang Manor, after finishing his evening meal, Wang Zhengwen, who had returned from his duties, followed his routine of heading to his study to review memorials. At his age, women were already optional.

Perhaps influenced by Emperor Yuanjing’s rejuvenation, most of the senior officials on the court had distanced themselves from women, focusing more on health and longevity.

However, Emperor Yuanjing had the Human Sect guiding his cultivation and making pills for him—privileges that the court officials could not enjoy.

Wang Simu brought a nourishing soup for her father, using the opportunity of tidying the desk to sneak peeks at the memorials and annotations. Occasionally, she would even brazenly ask questions.

"I heard from the servants that at today’s literary gathering, the huiyuan from Cloud Deer Academy showed up?" Wang Zhengwen asked.

"Yes, and he had a confrontation with Minister Sun's niece."

Wang Simu recounted the entire incident to her father, then snorted, 

"Father, I saw that Huiyuan Xu was a prodigy, which is why I invited him. But who would have thought he’s a sentimental fool, unable to show restraint—a mediocrity. Father, you should give him a good lesson, to vent for Sister Yan."

Wang Shoufu didn’t see things as superficially as his daughter and mused, “A scholar from Cloud Deer Academy, following the Confucian path, likely will not have too poor a temperament.

"For him to achieve huiyuan as a student of Cloud Deer Academy means he’s undoubtedly talented. As for the conflict among you youngsters, it’s not something to take seriously."

Wang Simu smirked and immediately said, "It seems your daughter’s  thoughts align with yours, Father. Do you think it’s possible to recruit him?"

"Recruit him? Why would we recruit him? Even if he is talented, there’s no need to risk offending the civil officials from the Imperial Academy. Besides, I’m the Prime Minister, a leader among civil officials." Wang Shoufu shook his head.

"Precisely because Father’s the leader of the civil officials, if you make a move to recruit him, there will be less resistance. If we can bring him under our wing, it would not only suppress the arrogance of Cloud Deer Academy but also add a capable man to our ranks—a win-win."

Wang Simu looked as if she was analysing the situation for her father’s benefit.

"Without a compelling reason, recruiting him would do more harm than good." Wang Zhengwen shook his head.

Wang Simu wanted to continue, but a glance from her father made her swallow her words.

She knew when to stop.

*Without a compelling reason... Well, I need more time to observe him...* Wang Simu thought happily.

...

The Welfare Hall, the Southern City.

In the wood shed, golden sunlight slowly faded, and Monk Jingchen soothed the “black dog”, lulling him into a sweet dream.

“Amitabha!”

The middle-aged monk with thick earlobes and a compassionate face spoke in a deep voice, “It’s a miracle that this child has lived until now.”

"The arcanists from the Sitianjian have treated him, all thanks to Sir Xu," Hengyuan said beside him.

“Over the years, I’ve wandered the mortal world, witnessing countless sorrows and joys, realizing that all beings suffer. Often, I ponder why, with myriad Buddha lamps, the darkness of the world remains so impenetrable.

"Not until yesterday, when I comprehended Mahayana Buddhism, did I understand that seeking personal salvation, pursuing the fruits of an Arhat or Bodhisattva, is for the self—small aspirations. To save all beings is Mahayana. If everyone harbours compassion, would there still be a need for Buddha lamps? No, there wouldn’t." Monk Jingchen sighed.

Hengyuan nodded, pressing his palms together. “Sir Xu is truly a divine being.”

Monk Jingchen also pressed his palms together. “He is a natural-born child of Buddha, a great gift to Buddhism from the heavens. This poor monk believes, one day, he will achieve complete enlightenment and renounce the world to join the monastic life.”

“I greatly look forward to that day,” Hengyuan replied, his heart burning.

Monk Jingchen nodded and continued, “This child’s body is weak, and his mind has been damaged. He will not recover fully in the short term, nor can he endure long travels. My suggestion is to send him to Qinglong Temple. As for you, it’s time for you to head west.

“You know, beyond the eighth rank lies the third, known as *Vajra*. If you don’t practice the Vajra Divine Art, you will never reach the rank of Vajra.”

Hengyuan hesitated for a long moment before slowly shaking his head. “Just now, you said that cultivating oneself is the lesser vehicle, while saving all beings is the greater vehicle.”

Monk Jingchen froze, then lowered his head in shame and pressed his palms together. “What senior uncle said is true. You indeed have greater wisdom. Very well, very well.”

Though he had comprehended the Greater Vehicle of Buddhism, *Mahayana*, the ingrained habits of decades weren’t so easily changed. This was the difference between sudden enlightenment and not-sudden enlightenment. Arhat Du’e had reached sudden enlightenment, so he no longer held onto such mental habits.

“Tomorrow, Senior Uncle will take us back to the Western Regions,” Monk Jingchen said.

“So soon? What about the matter of the evil creature? Won’t we investigate it further?”

“The evil creature has been free for several months; there's no rush. The Grandmaster wishes to return to the Western Regions first and spread the teachings of Mahayana,” Jingchen explained.

After sending off Monk Jingchen, Hengyuan was about to turn when he suddenly noticed an old Daoist standing in the shadows of the courtyard, smiling at him.

“Daoist Jinlian?”

…

Xu Manor.

The setting sun lingered on the western horizon, painting the sky in brilliant shades of crimson and gold. Xu Qi’an rode his little mare back home, tossing the reins to a servant at the gate and stepping inside just in time for dinner.

At the table, Xu Xinnian recounted the events of the literary gathering earlier that day, briefly mentioning how Lingyue had nearly fallen into a pond.

“What? Lingyue fell into the water?” Xu Qi’an quickly turned his attention to his little sister, concerned. “Are you feeling alright? Any headaches or fever? Could you catch a cold?”

Xu Lingyue replied in a soft voice, “No, big brother, don’t worry. I took medicine when I got home, so I won’t catch a cold.”

“What happened?” Xu Qi’an glared at Xu Erlang. “How did you take care of her? She fell into the water at a literary gathering—what good are you?”

Xu Erlang glanced at Lingyue, who quickly came to his defence. “It wasn’t second brother’s fault. He can’t watch me every second. Besides, when I fell into the water, he immediately pulled me out. The one who pushed me was the niece of the Minister of Law, but she already apologised and compensated me.”

The Minister of Law’s niece... Xu Qi’an raised his brows and sneered, “Fine. I’ll send someone to stake out the Sun family’s residence. The moment she steps out, we’ll run her over with a carriage and be done with it.”

Then, looking guilty, he turned to Lingyue. “Sister, it’s my fault you got involved.”

Lingyue puffed up her cheeks in a pout. “Big brother, what are you saying? We’re family; don’t be so formal.”

*What a sweet sister!*

…

After dinner, Xu Qi’an embarked on his long journey of cultivation—breathing exercises, visualisation, studying the Heart Sword technique, meditation, and practicing the Invincible Vajra Art. 

It reminded him of the overwhelming workload from his school days.

Suddenly, a thick fog enveloped his vision, and he found himself in the mist-shrouded world of Monk Shenshu. Passing through the layers of fog, he arrived at a dilapidated temple and saw the handsome monk seated in meditation.

Monk Shenshu looked at him with warm eyes and said, “I am about to enter deep sleep and will not awaken for a while, so I won’t be able to ensure your safety. I will give you another drop of my blood to help you practice the Invincible Vajra.”

“Your blood can help me cultivate the Invincible Vajra?” Xu Qi’an was startled.

Shenshu smiled. “You should understand that my undying body is based on something. This technique is difficult and slow for others, but for you, progress will be swift. With it, you’ll have enough strength to protect yourself.”

With that, Shenshu flicked a drop of blood into Xu Qi’an’s forehead.

Xu Qi’an was instantly ejected from the misty world, waking in his room.

Crack, crack, crack…

His body made popping sounds like firecrackers as his skin bulged with muscles and veins, which quickly turned a gleaming gold under the candlelight.

Xu Qi’an’s mind screamed, *Holy shit!?*

His Invincible Vajra Art had already reached a profound level. Now, if he were to fight Monk Jingsi in hand-to-hand combat, the outcome would be uncertain.

Of course, he couldn’t let the Buddhist sect know about this.

Xu Qi’an dispelled the golden glow and sat at his desk, deep in thought. *Monk Shenshu, an immortal-like figure from the Buddhist sect… surely he must have practiced the Invincible Vajra Art as well. And the Jianzheng allowed a Dharma battle, specifically naming me to represent the Sitianjian…*

*Why is the Jianzheng paving the way for me so blatantly? No, it feels like he’s treating me like a crop to be harvested later…*

At that moment, a knock sounded on his door.

“Who is it?”

Xu Qi’an stood up and opened the door. Outside, under the night sky, stood an elderly Daoist with white hair, holding a horsetail whisk and smiling.

Behind him were the swordsman in azure, Chu Yuanzhen, and the burly monk, Lu Zhishen.

“You…”

Xu Qi’an was stunned. *Why have they suddenly come to my house?*

“I have a young friend in trouble and would like Sir Xu’s help,” Daoist Jinlian said.
