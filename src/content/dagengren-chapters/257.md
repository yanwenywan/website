# 257. Inquiry

"Before leaving the palace, your subordinate took the liberty of doing something extra. I instructed the little eunuch overseeing us for His Majesty to…”

Xu Qi'an relayed to Wei Yuan exactly what he had taught the young eunuch to say.

Seeing Wei Yuan fall into deep thought, Xu Qi'an quickly added, "Your servant acted on his own initiative without permission. Please could Duke Wei give judgement on the situation."

Upon hearing this, Wei Yuan smiled and nodded. "Though it was done without orders, you did well. His Majesty is suspicious by nature and adept at maintaining balance. Your words, once relayed to him, will sow seeds of doubt toward Noble Consort Chen in his mind. This will prompt him to reconsider the entire case of Consort Fu, weighing the benefits and drawbacks from all sides, and reflect on the delicate balance he’s been maintaining."

Xu Qi'an was still somewhat unsatisfied and said hesitantly, "But what if His Majesty sees through it? Or if the little eunuch confesses to accepting bribes and passing along my message?"

"There's no flaw in your account—everything you told him genuinely happened," Wei Yuan replied with a smile. "As for the other issue, the eunuch revealing your bribe would only expose his own corruption, which would harm him without offering any benefit. After all, anyone smart enough to serve within His Majesty's inner chambers isn't likely to be that foolish."

*Hehe, I already knew that…* Xu Qi'an inwardly praised Wei Yuan's wisdom, saying admiringly, "Duke Wei, you are indeed supremely intelligent. Your subordinate is truly in awe."

Wei Yuan shot him a knowing glance, then shook his head with a quiet laugh.

Feeling light-hearted, Wei Yuan returned to the tea room and personally poured two cups of tea. "Now that you've entered the Refining Spirit stage, don't stop honing your primordial spirit. Once you feel pressure building up in the Outer meridians, you can start training your physical body ahead of schedule."

*Outer meridians… oh, he's referring to the temples.*

Xu Qi'an was momentarily puzzled before realising that the "Outer meridians" referred to what he knew as the temples—though in this world, there was no such term as "temples."

*"Outer meridians" sounds so much more high-class and sophisticated…* Xu Qi'an never really liked the term "temples" anyway, as it always felt more like a verb to him.[^1]

When the topic shifted to body tempering, Xu Qi'an knew that his recent actions had been well-received. Wei Yuan, in a good mood, was now ready to reward him.

That seemingly apologetic yet subtly boastful gesture Xu Qi'an made earlier? Wei Yuan, with his keen mind, had seen through it instantly. But leaders always appreciate subordinates who elevate their position—and even someone as brilliant as Wei Yuan wasn’t immune to that charm.

Had Xu Qi'an simply said, "Duke Wei, I’ve done something big again, haha!" the reaction would have been entirely different. Wei Yuan might have chastised him for arrogance and reminded him to remain humble.

"Body tempering?" Xu Qi'an asked.

Training the body was the main focus of the Refining Vitality stage—basically, a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercises, pushing one's physical limits again and again. Every three days, it was necessary to see a physician to ease muscle strain, and one had to continually consume large amounts of meat and nourishing herbal tonics.

Xu Qi'an had “eaten” nearly a hundred taels of silver in a year during his training—about half of what his uncle earned annually.

Having reached the Refining Spirit stage, the methods from the Refining Vitality stage were clearly no longer effective, and Xu Qi'an was unsure how to continue training his body.

"I've told you before, the martial system was not developed overnight. It has been constantly refined by countless predecessors to form the Nine Ranks of martial artists we know today."

Wei Yuan sipped his tea, settling into a reflective conversation. "The earliest method for achieving Bronze Skin and Iron Bones was to repeatedly strike the body with sticks and clubs, much like a blacksmith hammering raw iron into refined steel. The process was long and arduous, and if the foundation was not solid, one could die from a blow to a vital area."

*Duke Wei, are you referring to* that *kind of vital area…?* Xu Qi'an couldn't help but think of a disastrous scenario—chickens flying and eggs smashed.

"Later, someone invented medicinal baths using rare natural ingredients as the main components. Martial artists would sit in large cauldrons, breathing and resisting the heat, while absorbing the medicinal essence to temper their bodies and achieve Bronze Skin and Iron Bones."

"How dangerous was that?" Xu Qi'an asked.

"It was still very risky. Sometimes, the person would be…cooked," Wei Yuan answered.

"…"

Xu Qi'an's mind immediately conjured an image: he was sitting in a large cauldron surrounded by boiling water, while the medicine-savvy Chu Caiwei kept adding seasonings like star anise, beans, cinnamon, and spring onions…

Meanwhile, Xu Lingyin stood beside the cauldron, tears flowing from the corners of her mouth.

"Is there a safer method?" he asked, swallowing nervously.

"With the emergence of successive geniuses, a method was eventually developed—one that used Qi refining as the foundation and body tempering as a supplement. The core of this method lies in a unique Qi-circulating technique that tempers the body from the inside out. When combined with strikes or medicinal baths, the risks are greatly reduced."

Wei Yuan unfolded a piece of paper and wrote the words "Mixed Primordial Art" on it. He then said, "The Nightwatchers' most advanced technique is called the Mixed Primordial Art. Every Gold Gong uses this technique. If this were to be leaked to the Jianghu, it would cause a storm of bloodshed."

Once again, Xu Qi'an realised the immense benefits of working under Wei Yuan and joining the Nightwatchers. Here, he had access to the finest techniques and the most luxurious resources—things that wandering martial artists could only dream of. For Xu Qi'an, they were readily available.

Including that visualisation drawing—it, too, was top-tier.

Xu Qi'an had reached the Refining Spirit stage so quickly thanks to his impressive talent, but Wei Yuan's resources had played an equally crucial role.

The martial artist's path truly is one of hard labour. To break it down with modern knowledge, the ninth rank is the "brick-carrying" stage; the eighth rank adds Qi techniques to brick-carrying; the seventh rank is about breaking one's body with sheer effort. And the sixth rank? It's straight-up chest-breaking feats... Xu Qi'an sighed and asked, "Duke Wei, is there a Qi-circulating technique that can achieve Bronze Skin and Iron Bones without the need for medicinal baths or stick strikes?"

"There is!"

Wei Yuan's answer took Xu Qi'an by surprise. Xu Qi'an was first delighted, then tentatively asked, "In dreams, perhaps?"

…Wei Yuan looked at him in silence for a few seconds, then said gently, "Buddhism has similar techniques. Some say that the martial artist's Bronze Skin and Iron Bones were derived from the Buddhist Vajra Body. Others believe that the Buddha himself modelled his techniques after the martial artist's system, creating the path of the warrior monk."

*So, the warrior monk system includes a method for achieving Bronze Skin and Iron Bones without needing medicinal baths or stick strikes. This is perfect—I'll just get some tricks from Number Six next time...* Xu Qi'an unconsciously revealed a pure and innocent smile.

…

The Emperor’s Bedchamber

Emperor Yuanjing sat cross-legged on his bed, eyes closed as he practiced his breathing. A thin column of incense smoke rose from a burning stick at the corner of the bed, straight and slender.

An old eunuch stood to one side, head lowered, eyes downcast, making not a single sound.

At this moment, footsteps echoed from outside. A young eunuch stopped at the entrance to the bedchamber.

Glancing at the Emperor, who was entering a state of tranquillity, the old eunuch shuffled over to the door and lowered his voice, "What is it?"

"Godfather, the Daoist Leader from Lingbao Temple has sent someone to invite His Majesty," the young eunuch whispered.

The old eunuch was visibly taken aback, silently counting the days on his fingers. He thought to himself that the timing was right. Every month at this time, the National Teacher would retreat to recuperate, as her body became indisposed.

Even the Emperor couldn't disturb her, and would stay in his bedchamber to practice his breathing exercises.

"I see. You may leave."

After sending the young eunuch away, the old eunuch slowly returned to the Emperor's side and softly called out, "Your Majesty..."

Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes.

"The National Teacher has sent for you, inviting Your Majesty to join her in meditative reflection," said the old eunuch.

A hint of surprise flashed across Emperor Yuanjing's face. Then, for the first time, his usually calm, deep eyes gleamed with an unusual brightness.

"Prepare our carriage, quickly!"

Every month, the National Teacher suffered from the torment of karmic fire, her seven emotions and six desires surging uncontrollably. During this time, she would retreat into isolation, and no one was allowed to enter Lingbao Temple.

But Emperor Yuanjing knew that if there was ever a day the National Teacher agreed to dual cultivation with him, it would surely be during this period.

He had been waiting for this day for a long time. Though his black hair had regrown, and his body was as strong as a man in his prime, he had still not attained immortality.

If he wanted to go further, the only way was through dual cultivation with the National Teacher, to absorb her spiritual essence. Only then could he achieve true longevity and become the eternal Emperor of Feng.

Leaving the bedchamber, he boarded his dragon palanquin, urging the bearers along. Before long, they arrived at Lingbao Temple.

But when he saw the National Teacher, a woman, his hopes were dashed as he realised that she had merely invited him for their usual meditation, much like their previous practice sessions.

The female National Teacher, with a vermillion dot between her brows, her features as delicate as a painting, sat cross-legged on a prayer cushion. Her soft voice rang out, "Your Majesty, please sit."

Her jet-black hair was tied up with a lotus crown, accentuating her flawless, fair face. Not a single strand of hair was out of place.

Emperor Yuanjing was unwilling to accept this and said in a low voice, "If the National Teacher does not wish to engage in dual cultivation, why summon Us at this time?"

Luo Yuheng, eyes still closed, responded calmly, "This month, We are not tormented by the karmic fire. This poor daoist has promised to teach Your Majesty the method of immortality. We dare not shirk our duty, not even for a day."

Emperor Yuanjing was silent for a moment. He sat on his designated prayer mat but did not immediately close his eyes. Instead, he said, "National Teacher, the materials for the Rejuvenation Pill have been prepared. Tomorrow, We will send them to Lingbao Temple."

Luo Yuheng opened her eyes and studied Emperor Yuanjing. After a moment, she sighed, "Your Majesty's black hair has returned, and after years of cultivation, you are immune to all illnesses. There is no longer any need to refine that divine Four Seasons medicine."

Emperor Yuanjing ignored her, closing his eyes and resuming his breathing exercises.

Every year, Emperor Yuanjing would refine four large batches of pills, corresponding to the four seasonal transitions of spring wind, summer solstice, autumn equinox, and winter solstice.

Each batch of these pills was worth a fortune, equivalent to three years of taxes from a county—one that was particularly wealthy at that.

In addition to the four large batches, there were thirty-six smaller batches of pills. The sheer amount of silver consumed was staggering.

None of this silver came from the imperial treasury managed by the Ministry of Revenue. Instead, it was from the Emperor’s private coffers. As for how the silver ended up there, every court official knew, yet no one spoke of it.

By the time the meditation session with the National Teacher was over, the sun had already set.

Emperor Yuanjing, in a foul mood, returned to his bedchamber and fell silent. Remembering that the case involving Consort Fu was still unresolved, he impatiently said:

"Grand Companion, have the Cabinet draft an edict. The case of Consort Fu has been delayed for over ten days now. Order the Three Judicial Offices to present their findings within two days."

The findings on whether the Empress was guilty or not.

"Yes, Your Majesty."

The old eunuch hesitated for a moment before softly adding, "That Xu Qi'an, came to the palace again today."

Emperor Yuanjing's brow furrowed. "What is he doing here again? Have someone retrieve his gold token from the Nightwatcher constabulary tomorrow."

The Empress had already confessed, and the Consort Fu case was nearly closed. There was no reason for that Bronze Gong to keep coming to the palace.

The old eunuch nodded and cautiously asked, "Shall I summon the eunuch to report today’s findings?"

Emperor Yuanjing thought for a moment, then slowly nodded. "Summon him."

The old eunuch left the bedchamber and returned shortly, bringing in the young eunuch who had been monitoring Xu Qi'an.

The young eunuch kept his head lowered, his body bent, standing obediently before the Emperor.

Seated behind his desk, Emperor Yuanjing gazed down at the young eunuch from above and asked, "What did Xu Qi'an investigate in the palace today?"
