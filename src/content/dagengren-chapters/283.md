# 283. Master, Take Care

Under the guidance of the monks at the gate, Xu Qi’an passed through the front courtyard and entered the inner courtyard.

The young monk stopped in the yard, pressed his palms together in a gesture of respect, and said, "Brother Hengyuan, please wait here for a moment while I notify Sect-Uncle Jingchen."

Xu Qi’an returned the greeting with a Buddhist gesture, saying, "Thank you, Brother."

As the young monk entered a room, Xu Qi’an reflected on the names listed on the roster.

The Western Region emissary had a total of twenty-one members.

The innkeeper had to arrange rooms for the delegation, and since the inn's rooms varied in quality, monks of higher status would naturally get the better rooms. It wouldn't make sense for a novice to stay in a presidential suite while the leading elder was placed in a windowless single room.

Thus, the innkeeper had a clear understanding of each monk's standing.

The most senior monk was, of course, the delegation's leader, "Master Du'e." However, the innkeeper wasn't sure about his exact level of cultivation.

Following him were two monks, "Jingchen" and "Jingsi," who appeared to be fellow disciples, judging by their dharma names.

As for the other monks, their statuses seemed relatively equal.

*One is called 'Capital City,' and the other 'Nearsighted.'[^1] These two disciples sure have interesting names,* Xu Qi’an thought to himself.

At that moment, the young monk returned and invited Xu Qi’an inside.

Following the monk into the room, Xu Qi’an noticed the scent of sandalwood in the air. A monk with a round face and plump earlobes sat cross-legged on a mat, smiling at the door.

The monk's aura was restrained, making him seem no different from an ordinary person.

"Senior Brother Jingchen," Xu Qi’an greeted with palms pressed together.

"Junior Brother Hengyuan," the middle-aged monk returned the greeting.

He then gestured for the young monk to serve tea. After Xu Qi’an had taken a sip, the monk finally spoke, "Brother Panshu just returned to the temple."

*This was an indirect way of saying that the monks from Qinglong Temple had only just learned about the arrival of the delegation in the capital. Brother Panshu had just returned to Qinglong Temple, and unless there were special circumstances, he wouldn’t send the monks to pester the delegation…* Xu Qi’an immediately grasped the implications and realized this was a subtle test.

He had anticipated this and calmly replied, "This poor monk has been away from the temple for many years."

Monk Jingchen smiled and asked, "What brings you here today, Brother Hengyuan?"

His voice carried a strange power, making Xu Qi’an instinctively resist lying. He felt compelled to reveal his true purpose.

*A fifth-rank Silacarya?*[^2]

Xu Qi’an’s heart skipped a beat.

The abbot of Qinglong Temple, Panshu, was also a fifth rank. Monks at this level were like walking "rules"; they would consciously or unconsciously influence those around them.

A monk does not lie, a monk must be abstinent, a monk must not kill, etc, etc… having already restricted themselves under such rules for so long, a Silacarya could consciously or unconsciously influence those around them.

Xu Qi’an had never witnessed a Silacarya in battle, but when he investigated the Sangpo case at Qinglong Temple, he had specifically studied the profiles of Buddhist experts.

Silacaryas’ combat prowess stemmed entirely from their adherence to monastic discipline, somewhat resembling the Confucians' "Laws follow commandments," though not as flexible.

In simple terms, a Confucian might declare, "Xu Qi’an’s Diao Chan is riding his waist!"—and this could actually materialise, though with serious side effects for the caster.[^3]

In contrast, a Buddhist Silacarya might declare, "Xu Qi’an, reverse smoking is a scorn to God!"[^4]—which would only result in his lips being burnt, without much other consequence.

Confucians could alter reality through their words, whereas Silacaryas made others follow preexisting rules, making the two fundamentally different.

Xu Qi’an pressed his palms together and recited a Buddhist prayer: "Brother, have you and your fellow disciples come to the capital because of the sealed object from the Sangpo case?"

His words were like a boulder thrown into a calm lake.

Monk Jingchen narrowed his eyes but remained composed, smiling as he asked, "Did Brother Panshu tell you this?"

Before Panshu had returned to Qinglong Temple, Master Du'e had strictly instructed everyone not to reveal the existence of the sealed object, even to the monks of Qinglong Temple.

Master Jingchen was trying to set a trap.

Xu Qi’an shook his head and sighed, "It wasn’t my master. To be honest, I also played a part in the Sangpo case..."

A golden gleam seemed to flash through Monk Jingchen’s serene eyes.

"I have a junior brother, his dharma name is Henghui. We grew up together, deeply bonded. Over a year ago, Henghui suddenly disappeared and stole a spell from the temple that conceals one’s aura. After much investigation, I discovered he had likely been abducted by a criminal network..."

Xu Qi’an adopted a sorrowful expression, as if overwhelmed by grief, and had to recite a Buddhist prayer to soothe his emotions: "Amitabha."

Monk Jingchen, engrossed in the story, noticed Hengyuan’s sadness and felt moved. "Is there more to this case?"

"Indeed, Brother Henghui fell in love with a female devotee, and they made a private commitment to each other. Thus, he stole the temple’s artefact and fled with her."

Jingchen frowned, puzzled. "Even if they eloped, why would he need to steal the artifact?"

Xu Hengyuan sighed and explained, "The woman was the daughter of King Yu. King Yu is the emperor's brother, a noble king. Without the artifact to conceal their auras, they could never have escaped the capital."

*This...* Monk Jingchen was at a loss for words, unable to refute the reasoning.

Xu Qi’an then briefly recounted how the two naive young lovers were deceived, dragged into court politics, and ultimately met tragic ends.

"Amitabha!" Monk Jingchen pressed his palms together, his face showing compassion as he recited the Buddhist prayer.

After a few moments of silence, he asked, "But how does this relate to the Sangpo case?"

Good question! Xu Qi’an smirked inwardly but maintained his composed expression, answering, “This case is far more complicated than it appears on the surface... At the end of last year, the Yongzhen Shanhe temple in the Sangpo Lake was suddenly destroyed in an explosion, and the evil entity sealed beneath the lake was released.

"The emperor was furious and ordered the three judicial offices to investigate thoroughly. I became involved because that evil entity took refuge in my junior brother, Henghui."

"What?!"

Master Jingchen’s face changed dramatically, and he hurriedly asked, “Where is the evil creature now? Is Henghui still alive? How did Great Feng handle this? Did the Jianzheng not intervene? Or has the evil been sealed again by the Jianzheng?”

He bombarded Xu Qi’an with a barrage of questions, completely losing the serene demeanor of a monk.

"Brother Jingchen, don't rush, allow me to explain slowly..."

Xu Qi'an began to explain the intricate details of the Sangpo case and the Pingyang Princess case, carefully dissecting their connection and the secrets entwined within, revealing everything to Master Jingchen.

Master Jingchen remained silent for a long time, seemingly overwhelmed by the complex and interwoven nature of the cases.

These hidden truths were unknown even to Abbot Panshu, who had merely journeyed west to inform the Buddhist sect of the Sangpo seal's breach.

*His uncle had gone to the palace to meet the emperor and understand the details, yet I, who stayed behind at the relay station, am now the first to know the entire story...* Jingchen sighed deeply:

“This case is indeed complicated and strange, and the person who unravelled it even more remarkable. How did Brother Hengyuan come to know such detailed information?”

Xu Qi'an knew that this was a question bound to arise. He remained calm, forcing himself to fight the instinct not to lie, and replied:

“Though the case was officially handled by the Three Judicial Offices, the one who truly uncovered the Sangpo case and the Pingyang Princess case was a Silver Gong from the Nightwatchers named Xu Qi’an. I share a deep friendship with Sir Xu and was drawn into the case due to Henghui, which is how I came to know it so well.”

*Silver Gong Xu Qi’an...* Jingchen committed the name to memory and quickly inquired, “Who exactly is this Silver Gong Xu, Brother Hengyuan? Tell me more about him.”

"Ah!"

Hengyuan did not speak at once but let out a long sigh.

“Brother, why this sigh?”

"I was just thinking of Xu Qi’an, and I am filled with deep emotions."

“Oh? What do you mean?”

Hengyuan said slowly, “Brother, you don’t know, but Xu Qi’an is the most extraordinarily gifted person I have ever encountered. In the way of cultivation, he possesses peerless talent, unmatched by almost anyone in Great Feng.

“In matters of justice, he refuses to take anything from the people, dedicating himself solely to upholding righteousness.

“In solving cases, despite Great Feng being full of experts, none can match him.

“As for poetry, he is hailed as the greatest poet of the past two centuries in Great Feng. It’s said that the oiran of Jiaofangsi are madly in love with him, yet he remains indifferent.”

Master Jingchen was dumbfounded, never expecting that such a person existed in the capital.

“Does such a person really exist in this world? It’s a pity he hasn’t entered our Buddhist sect,” Jingchen remarked, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

*… Damn it, I’ve overdone it! Is this guy trying to convert me to Buddhism? What do I need this iron rod for then?*

Xu Qi’an, now on high alert, casually shifted the conversation and made his intentions clear: “The reason I’ve come to you, Brother, is to inquire about the nature of the evil sealed beneath Sangpo.

"I know it’s connected to our Buddhist House, but I can’t understand why it had to be sealed under Sangpo in the Great Feng.”

"This..." Jingchen's face showed hesitation.

"Brother, is there something you can't say?" Hengyuan asked directly.

“This matter is a Buddhist secret, Brother. It’s best not to ask further,” Jingchen responded.

"Hah!"

Hengyuan sneered, “I see now. I thought of the Western Buddhist sect as family, but in the eyes of my fellow disciples, I’m just an outsider.

“Fine, fine, it was my mistake for thinking otherwise. I’ll take my leave. The Western Buddhist sect is the Western Buddhist sect; Qinglong Temple is Qinglong Temple—different entities.”

With that, he got up to leave.

“Stop!”

Jingchen called out, his face showing a trace of anger, “We are all disciples of the Buddha, worshipping the same Buddha. We are one family. Brother, your words earlier attack the heart. Don’t say such things again.”

*There's a chance...* Hengyuan remained expressionless but inwardly smirked as he gave a cold grunt.

That grunt was infused with the Buddhist "Lion’s Roar," causing the sound to reverberate through the room.

*Warrior Monks’ tempers have always been this fiery…* Jingchen sighed in his heart and gestured for him to sit. “Please, Brother. I will share with you what I know.”

Qinglong Temple was the last remnant of the Western Buddhist sect in the Great Feng. If the Western sect wished to continue spreading its teachings in the Central Plains, Qinglong Temple was an indispensable force.

Given this context, the Western Buddhist sect highly valued its "family" relationship with Qinglong Temple, and any rift must be mended and avoided.

“That evil creature is indeed connected to our sect. According to Master Du'e, it was a traitor of the Buddhist sect.”

“A traitor of the Buddhist sect?”

*As I expected. Shenshu was a buddhist, yet sealed by the buddhists. If not a traitor, what else could he be?*

“Who was this traitor?” Hengyuan asked.

“That I do not know,” Master Jingchen shook his head. “This is a closely guarded Buddhist secret. Even I am not privy to such details.”

*I wish I could use the Qi-watching technique to see if he’s lying… It’s Shenshu, the traitor monk’s name was Shenshu...* Hengyuan pressed further:

“Why was he sealed instead of being put to rest?”

*Buddhism speaks of mercy, but surely they wouldn’t be so lenient with a traitor?*

“When Abbot Panshu relayed the news back to the West, the arhats and bodhisattvas took it very seriously, communicating through thunderous proclamations. This level of formality hasn’t been seen since the battle at Shanhai Pass twenty years ago.” Jingchen pondered for a moment and added:

“Along the way, I overheard Master Du'e mention that the demon monk cannot be killed.”

*Cannot be killed?!*

This passage contained a wealth of information that forced Xu Qi'an to pause his inquiries and reflect deeply.

*So, Shenshu was sealed in Sangpo not because the Buddhist sect showed mercy, but because they couldn’t kill him.*

*Shenshu had once said that he had miraculously entered the highest realm of "immortality."*

*But let's not forget, Buddhism has the existence of the Buddha, a being beyond the nine ranks. Could even the Buddha not kill Shenshu?*

*My goodness, Shenshu is even more terrifying than I imagined. What kind of monster is he...?* Xu Qi'an muttered inwardly.

*Could it be that he could easily take out the old Jianzheng with a single punch?*

"I see, so it's because he can't be killed. No wonder they had to dismember and seal him," Xu Qi'an said in a deep voice.

"But why was Sangpo chosen for the seal?" he asked again.

Sealing such a dangerous traitor, a dire threat, within the ally state of the Great Feng's borders surely must have been due to some unavoidable reason. Otherwise, sealing him within their own domain would have been more secure.

"This question also puzzled me, and I asked Uncle Du'e about it on our journey. He told me that it stemmed from an agreement made 500 years ago with the the Great Feng’s Emperor Wuzong," Jingchen explained.

*An agreement from 500 years ago... During that time, Buddhism was spreading across the Great Feng, with temples springing up everywhere. So there was indeed a hidden truth behind this. But most of the records from 500 years ago had either been destroyed, altered, or concealed.* 

*Well damn, there’s no way to investigate further.*

After a bit more conversation, Xu Qi'an confirmed that he couldn't extract any more information, so he stood up to take his leave.

Monk Jingchen personally escorted him out. As soon as they exited the room, they saw a handsome monk walking down the corridor toward them.

"Senior Brother!" the handsome monk pressed his palms together in greeting.

Jingchen returned the gesture and introduced him, "This is Senior Brother Hengyuan from Qinglong Temple. Address him as Senior Brother."

Then, introducing the younger monk to Xu Hengyuan, Jingchen said, "This is Junior Brother Jingsi."

*“Nearsighted” is so young?* Xu Hengyuan was a little surprised.

"Senior Brother Hengyuan." The handsome monk bowed.

Xu Qi'an returned the greeting and then said to Jingchen, "Senior Brother, there's no need to see me off."

As he watched Xu Qi'an's figure disappear into the distance, Jingsi lingered in thought, his gaze following for a long while.

"What's on your mind, Junior Brother?" Jingchen asked.

"For some reason, I feel that he has an aura that draws people closer," Jingsi said.

...

Xu Qi'an left the courier station, walking quickly along the street.

*Though I still don't know Monk Shenshu's identity, I've at least confirmed a few things: First, he is indeed a Buddhist traitor—this is undeniable. Second, his cultivation level is far higher than I anticipated—so high that even the Buddha couldn't kill him, though there's no evidence that the Buddha tried... I'll assume that for now.*

*Third, I’m only responsible for helping him uncover his identity and recover his memory. As for his enmity with the Buddhist sect, I won't get involved, not unless I become a Martial God—but that's impossible.*

*Fourth, I must cling to this major opportunity and extract as many benefits as I can.*

*Fifth, the existence of Shenshu must not be revealed to anyone, not even Wei Yuan. This matter is too great.*

*Sixth, since it's still early, I should visit theGoulan for some music.*

Suddenly, Xu Qi'an spotted a familiar figure among the crowd ahead.

It was a burly and tall monk, his chin sporting a bluish-black stubble, as if he had just shaved.

The loose monk robes he wore seemed to fit perfectly, concealing the muscles beneath.

*Fuck, Hengyuan!!*

A thousand fucks ran through Xu Qi'an's mind.

Master Hengyuan also spotted him and, despite his surprise, couldn't help but feel puzzled by Xu Qi'an's attire.

"Sir Xu, why are you dressed like this?"

"Performance art..." Xu Qi'an maintained a straight face.

“?”

"Are you on your way to the Sanyang Post Station?"

"My fellow disciples have arrived, so I must go see them."

"Could... could you not see them?" Xu Qi'an forced a smile, trying not to let his facial muscles twitch.

"Why?" Hengyuan was baffled.

*Because you might end up getting beaten up...* Xu Qi'an chuckled dryly and shook his head.

Hengyuan looked at him a few more times and then nodded. "I just came from the Xu residence after having a meal."

*Huh? You went to my house? Oh, you went to congratulate Erlang on passing the national exam, didn’t you? And he didn’t kick you out?*

Xu Qi'an suddenly felt a deep sense of guilt, realizing he had set up both his little brother and the kind-hearted Master Hengyuan, truly feeling unworthy.

He vowed to become a better person.

"Master..."

Xu Qi'an pulled out a ten-tael banknote from his sleeve and sincerely handed it to Master Hengyuan. "This is my contribution to the elderly and children at the Welfare Home."

If it were for himself, Hengyuan would not accept it, but knowing it was meant to help the elderly and orphans, the kind-hearted Master Hengyuan couldn't refuse.

"Amitabha, Sir Xu is truly a great benefactor," Hengyuan said, full of admiration.

"It's what I should do, it's what I should do..."

Xu Qi'an waved goodbye, walked a few steps, and then couldn't resist calling out, "Master!"

Hengyuan stopped and turned back, "Sir Xu, do you have more to say?"

"...Take care!"

...

Xu Qi'an found a secluded alley, changed back into his Nightwatcher uniform, and, familiar with the route, entered a Goulan.

"Sir, are you here for a room or a meal?" a servant in green greeted him.

"Get your most beautiful girl to come and give me a massage," Xu Qi'an went straight to the second floor.

The private rooms on the second floor were reserved for VIPs, where those with standing would come to enjoy music and performances.

Meanwhile, Master Hengyuan arrived at the gate of the station.

The gatekeepers exchanged glances, wondering if Buddhism had flourished so greatly in the Great Feng.

"Which temple does this Senior Brother practice at?"

Filled with doubt, one of the gatekeepers stopped Hengyuan.

Master Hengyuan pressed his palms together, "I am Hengyuan of Qinglong Temple. I heard that my fellow disciples have arrived in the capital, so I came to pay my respects."

After he spoke, he keenly noticed that the two gatekeepers' eyes widened, as if they had seen a ghost.

"Is something wrong?" Hengyuan asked, puzzled.

"Heh heh, nothing is wrong. Senior Brother, please wait here while I go inform them." The gatekeeper gave Hengyuan a deep look before turning inside.

Moments later, he returned, expressionless. "Please, come in."
