# 378. Three Angers of Emperor Yuanjing

According to protocol, when officials return to the capital after conducting inspections or investigations in the provinces, their first duty is to enter the palace, report to the Emperor, and submit their findings.

Before this, urgent or non-urgent documents must be sent ahead to the capital.

Whether it's a court audience or major events, copies of  documents must reach the capital in advance. Urgent matters are expedited—600 li or 800 li, depending on their importance.

For non-urgent matters, documents are still sent back to the capital in advance.

This is both to uphold the Emperor's dignity, ensuring composure in critical moments, and to give the Emperor sufficient time to think and consult with trusted ministers.

However, one exception existed—rebellion.

Chuzhou was massacred, the city annihilated; the Zhenbei King executed within its walls, the Great Feng losing its national divine general. Such serious events would ordinarily warrant 800 li grade urgency, though, frankly, if horses could sprout wings and fly, a 1000 li expedition would still be a little slow.

But the delegation deliberately refrained from sending documents ahead or notifying the court. Naturally, the delegation was not plotting rebellion.

“We aim to catch the court and His Majesty completely unprepared!”

This was what Provincial Administrator Zheng Xinghuai, had said.

The chaos caused in the court by this would allow him to manoeuvre, negotiate, and persuade his former allies and Prime Minister Wang to unite the entire cohort of civil officials.

The delegation disembarked from the official ship, with the Imperial Guards carrying a thin coffin. Inside was the corpse of the Zhenbei King—a body meticulously reassembled, to be surprisingly complete.

At the dock, experienced foremen immediately ordered the labourers to step back, forbidding them from blocking the officials’ path or even observing.

Such situations often implied that an official had perished. Should anyone display a disrespectful or curious gaze, it might provoke the wrath of the deceased’s comrades.

The foremen had encountered a similar incident last year. During early spring, when ice still floated on the canal, an official ship reportedly from Yunzhou had docked.

A group of Nightwatchers carried several coffins ashore. A few foremen, thinking themselves at a safe distance, whispered and gestured, treating it as idle gossip.

The leading Silver Gong broke their legs, shattered their teeth, and tossed them into the canal—leaving them half-dead.

Carrying the coffin, the officials entered the city, proceeded to the inner city, and finally reached the Imperial Palace, where they were stopped outside the Palace Walls.

Xu Qi’an stood at the forefront, flanked by two censors on his left and the Deputy Justice of the High Court and Chief Constable Chen on his right.

“Go inform His Majesty that the delegation sent to Chuzhou has returned to report on their mission,” Xu Qi’an commanded.

“Please wait, my lords,” the solider of the Yulin Imperial Guards bowed and then ran into the palace.

…

In the Emperor’s sleeping quarters, Emperor Yuanjing sat cross-legged, eyes closed, practising Daoist breathing techniques.

A eunuch approached the threshold hurriedly but remained silent, head lowered.

The elderly eunuch in a python robe, standing by the Emperor’s side, glanced at the doorway and then at the Emperor. He approached cautiously and whispered, “What is it?”

The junior eunuch whispered a few words.

The python-robed eunuch frowned, waved him off, and then returned to Emperor Yuanjing, carefully lowering his voice, “Your Majesty…”

Disturbing the Emperor during meditation was strictly forbidden unless the matter was urgent.

After years of serving him, the eunuch knew this rule well.

Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes slowly. “What is it?”

“Your Majesty, the delegation sent to Chuzhou has returned and awaits your summons outside the palace,” the eunuch replied respectfully.

Emperor Yuanjing frowned. “Why hasn’t the Cabinet sent any reports from Chuzhou?”

The Emperor had only learned of this upon the delegation’s arrival in the capital.

He narrowed his eyes, pondering for a moment, before finally saying, “Summon them to the Imperial Study.”

The eunuch departed.

Emperor Yuanjing’s expression was inscrutable, like an ominous, immovable statue.

…

The delegation received the summons and was led into the palace by a eunuch dressed in azure robes. Naturally, the coffin and its contents were not allowed entry.

Even though it contained the remains of the Zhenbei King, permission from the Emperor was required for its entry into the palace. At this point, no one in the palace, aside from the delegation, knew that the coffin held the remains of the Great Feng’s foremost warrior—the Emperor’s own brother.

Inside the opulent and spacious Imperial Study, the delegation stood silently. A quarter of an hour later, Emperor Yuanjing entered with several eunuchs.

Clad in Daoist robes, his hair jet-black, the Emperor’s flowing sleeves gave him an ethereal air. Instead of sitting behind the grand desk, he stopped in front of the delegation, his stern gaze sweeping over their faces. In a calm yet commanding tone, he said:

“We inquired with the Cabinet and were informed that no prior documents were received from you.”

His gaze briefly landed on Xu Qi’an, as though finding this vulgar martial artist beneath his attention, before shifting to the two censors and the Deputy Justice of the High Court.

“Do none of you understand protocol?”

The two censors and the Deputy Justice lowered their heads. Before they could respond, Zheng Xinghuai stepped forward and bowed.

“Your Majesty, Chuzhou City has been destroyed. How could we have sent documents?”

Only now did Emperor Yuanjing seem to notice him. After scrutinising him for a moment, the Emperor said, “Minister Zheng, as the Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou, how dare you return to the capital without the court’s permission?”

This was a charge of dereliction of duty.

Zheng Xinghuai let out a bitter laugh, meeting the Emperor’s gaze with defiance. “The Seat of Chuzhou no longer exists. My position as Administrator is now meaningless.”

Referring to himself as “I” instead of “your servant,” Minister Zheng’s attitude was clearly abnormal. Perhaps despair had left him fearless. Xu Qi’an frowned.

“What do you mean by this?” Emperor Yuanjing’s brows furrowed deeply.

Zheng Xinghuai took a deep breath and said loudly, “The High General of Chuzhou, the Zhenbei King, in his pursuit of ascending to Rank Two, colluded with the Church of the Warlock God and the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect to massacre 380,000 innocent lives in Chuzhou City.

“Your servant petitions Your Majesty to avenge the unjustly slaughtered citizens and punish the Zhenbei King.”

With that, he retrieved a memorial from his sleeve and presented it with both hands.

“Your servant petitions Your Majesty to avenge the unjustly slaughtered citizens and punish the Zhenbei King,” the rest of the delegation echoed, each producing a memorial and presenting it.

Xu Qi’an’s memorial, notably, had been drafted by Censor Liu.

Though Xu Qi’an never admitted to being coarse and considered himself well-educated after nine years of compulsory schooling, he had to concede his incompetence when it came to the rigid eight-legged essays. 

Besides, his handwriting was atrocious.

Hearing this, Emperor Yuanjing’s expression did not shift. He stared at the delegation blankly for a moment before raising a trembling hand to accept the memorials.

After a long time, the Emperor finished reading and, with a hoarse voice, asked, “Where is the Zhenbei King now?”

*This wretched Emperor’s acting skills are incredible. He and Duke Wei could compete for an acting award…* Xu Qi’an mocked inwardly.

As one of the masterminds behind the massacre, Emperor Yuanjing could not possibly be unaware of it. He must have asked this deliberately, still assuming the Zhenbei King was alive and well in the northern territories.

“Your Majesty!”

As the lead official, Xu Qi’an stepped forward, feeling it was only right that he deliver the final blow.

With impassioned conviction, he declared: “Rest assured, Your Majesty. The Zhenbei King defied both heaven and man, committed sins beyond measure, and was ultimately struck down. The delegation has transported his body back to the capital. It now awaits outside the palace.

“How Your Majesty wishes to deal with this villain’s remains is for Your Majesty to decide.”

*Crash!*

It was as if a sudden clap of thunder exploded by his ears. Emperor Yuanjing's complexion instantly turned deathly pale, drained of all colour.

He stared blankly at Xu Qi’an, bloodshot veins slowly spreading across his eyes, as though he'd been struck by an immense blow. His voice, now genuinely hoarse, trembled:

“You... you... what are you saying... what did you just say?”

Xu Qi’an declared loudly, “Your Majesty, The Zhenbei King’s body lies just outside the palace gates, drawn and quartered. Rest assured, he’s thoroughly dead.”

*Thud, thud, thud...* Emperor Yuanjing’s head felt as though it had been struck repeatedly with a wooden club. He staggered, unable to keep his balance, and almost toppled backwards.

“Your Majesty!”

The elderly eunuch let out a sharp, shrill cry, rushing forward to support Emperor Yuanjing, preserving the emperor’s last shred of dignity.

“Get off me!”

Emperor Yuanjing growled lowly, shoving the eunuch aside with sudden force. He staggered wildly out of the Imperial Study, his retreating figure filled with disarray and helplessness, his face white as a sheet of paper.

He could no longer maintain the majesty or composure of a ruler of the nation.

“Hurry, follow him! Protect His Majesty, protect His Majesty!”

The eunuch’s piercing cries gradually faded into the distance.

Xu Qi’an lowered his head, the corners of his lips curling into a cold smile.

Emperor Yuanjing bolted out of the Imperial Study, running with no regard for his dignity. The wind whipped at his long beard and reddened his eyes, making him appear less like an emperor and more like a pitiable man fleeing calamity.

The palace gates gradually came into view. Emperor Yuanjing caught sight of the Imperial Guards accompanying the delegation and the coffin they carried. At this moment, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.

The elderly eunuch, along with a group of attendants and guards, finally caught up with him, their relief palpable.

They too halted, silently standing behind Emperor Yuanjing, none daring to utter a word.

After a while, Emperor Yuanjing lifted his feet again, slowly walking towards the Imperial Guards. He stepped out of the palace gates and approached the coffin.

“Put it down!”

The old emperor’s voice rasped.

The coffin was gently set on the ground.

Emperor Yuanjing stood silently, staring at the coffin lid in a daze. After a long time, he reached out and pressed his hand against the lid. The moment his palm touched it, the veins on his forehead bulged slightly.

Because the coffin lid was light. It was a thin coffin, symbolically offering Zhenbei King the merest shred of dignity, since after all he needed to be transported to the capital.

Was this all his brother was worthy of?

The lid slowly slid open. The moment Emperor Yuanjing saw the contents of the coffin, his breathing abruptly quickened.

The Zhenbei King’s corpse was shrivelled and desiccated, resembling a mummified body that had weathered many years. His limbs and head were severed from the torso.

*Clatter...* The Imperial Guards and Yulin Guard present all dropped to their knees. To stand and witness the emperor’s grief was a grave disrespect.

But there were always those stubborn few, such as Xu Qi’an and the delegation, who had followed him out.

Xu Qi’an, without hesitation, fell to his knees in a "tiger landing pose," expressing his respect for the emperor. In a deep tone, he said:

“Your Majesty must take care of your dragon body and not grieve excessively. Remember, deep emotions shorten one’s lifespan.”

Emperor Yuanjing took a deep breath. His resentment for Xu Qi’an had just slightly lessened when the scoundrel added, “If the people of Chuzhou knew how deeply Your Majesty grieved for them, they would surely find comfort, even in the Nine Springs.”

Emperor Yuanjing’s face froze, his gaze turning venomous as he glared at Xu Qi’an.

By this time, Xu Qi’an had already lowered his head, so he missed the emperor’s fierce look, which clearly conveyed the words: “Shut up.” Undeterred, Xu Qi’an continued loudly:

“The Zhenbei King massacred 380,000 civilians in Chuzhou City. His death is well-deserved. But now that he’s dead, his crimes remain unproven. Whether to expose his body to the public or to flog it posthumously is for Your Majesty to decide. This humble servant has no objections.”

The Yulin Guards at the city gate stirred uneasily.

Only now did they realise that the coffin held the remains of the renowned Zhenbei King, the most formidable martial artist in Great Feng, and the emperor’s own brother.

Such a powerful figure had actually fallen?

Even more shocking was the revelation that Zhenbei King had slaughtered 380,000 civilians in Chuzhou City.

Faced with such earth-shattering news, no one could suppress their emotions. Whispers erupted instantly. Even Emperor Yuanjing’s presence couldn’t silence the Yulin Guards.

Emperor Yuanjing raised his hand and pointed into the distance. His pale lips slowly formed a single word:

“Leave!”

Xu Qi’an pretended to be deaf, continuing: “When does Your Majesty plan to announce this to the world?”

“Xu Qi’an!”

Emperor Yuanjing suddenly erupted, his roar trembling with fury. His entire body quaked as if his chest was about to burst. He shouted:

“Do you really think I wouldn’t dare kill you? I’ll kill you right now—kill you this instant!”

He reached for the sword of the nearest guard.

“Your Majesty, please take care of your dragon body. Your lowly servant will now take his leave.”

Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Xu Qi’an tactfully made his escape.

“Get out! All of you, get out!”

Emperor Yuanjing roared.

Administrator Zheng seemed inclined to argue, but Censor Liu tugged on his sleeve, bowing as they retreated.

The delegation dispersed, refraining from any further private discussions. After all, the necessary words and plans had already been exchanged aboard the official ship.

……..

The Nightwatcher Constabulary.

After over a month, Xu Qi’an finally returned. With a clear purpose in mind, he headed straight for the Tower of Noble Spirit. After the guards announced his arrival, he ascended to the seventh floor.

Wei Yuan, clad in an azure robe embroidered with cloud patterns, had his hair simply tied back with a green jade hairpin. His appearance was carefree and dashing, complemented by his refined features and the deep, world-weary gaze in his eyes.

He exuded the charm of a seasoned yet handsome man.

Wei Yuan was playing a game of go against himself, his left hand placing black stones and his right hand placing white. Without looking up, he said coolly, “You’re back.”

Xu Qi’an grunted, not bothering with formalities, and sat heavily at the table.

“The Zhenbei King is dead.”

His tone was sombre.

“Dead is dead.”

Wei Yuan’s gaze remained fixed on the chessboard, his brow furrowing. His focus was entirely on the game. “Wait a moment; let me finish this match.”

Suddenly, Xu Qi’an reached out and swept the board clear.

*Clatter...* Black and white stones scattered across the floor.

Wei Yuan, visibly annoyed, raised his hand as if to strike but then lowered it gently. He snorted, “Hitting you would only hurt my hand. Go brew some tea.”

After Xu Qi’an had brewed the tea, Wei Yuan held the cup, blew on it, but did not drink. In an unhurried tone, he said, “What do you want to know?”

Xu Qi’an got straight to the point. “Duke Wei, did you already know the site of Zhenbei King’s massacre was Chuzhou City?”

Wei Yuan nodded.

*The sudden mobilisation of the Yao and barbarian tribes towards Chuzhou City was likely due to Duke Wei’s leaked information...* Xu Qi’an’s suspicions deepened, so he chose to pursue a different question first:

“How did Duke Wei know? As far as I’m aware, even the rogue arcanists colluding with the barbarians, the Yao and barbarian tribes, and the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom, were at a loss.”

“I guessed!”

Wei Yuan smiled faintly. “Know thyself and know thy enemy, and you will never be defeated. Magic grants extraordinary power, but those who rely too heavily on it will end up blinded.”

This response caught Xu Qi’an off guard. He frowned deeply.

“You’re saying you deduced Chuzhou City based on your understanding of Zhenbei King? But the Yao and barbarian tribes understand him just as well.”

Wei Yuan suddenly sneered. “Who told you I was guessing about Zhenbei King?”
