# 380. Dark Currents Abound

Prime Minister Wang cupped his hands towards the assembled officials and followed the old eunuch into the palace, walking all the way to the side hall of the imperial study.

The old eunuch instructed a servant to serve tea and respectfully said, “Prime Minister sir, please wait a moment.”

With that, he left.

Prime Minister Wang sat alone on the chair, and waited for a whole hour.

He showed no impatience, waiting silently. Clad in his crimson robe and high hat, his temples were streaked with white.

His expression remained calm, betraying no emotion. Yet the occasional flicker of distraction in his eyes revealed that the elderly man’s feelings were not as composed as they seemed.

At last, footsteps echoed in the corridor.

Prime Minister Wang’s slightly clouded eyes lit up faintly as he turned towards the doorway.

The old eunuch, dressed in a python robe with a horsetail whisk draped over his arm, entered alone. With a tone of regret, he said, “Prime Minister Sir, His Majesty is overcome with grief and cannot compose himself to meet you.”

The light in Prime Minister Wang’s eyes dimmed, little by little.

The old eunuch sighed softly. “His Majesty needs time to recover. You know how deeply he cherished King Huai. They were brothers of the same blood, and His Majesty was particularly close to him since childhood. Now that he’s gone so suddenly…”

Prime Minister Wang nodded stiffly, clasped his hands in farewell, and left the side hall of the imperial study.

As he descended the steps, Prime Minister Wang hesitated for a moment, then came to his senses. He turned towards the imperial study and bowed deeply.

Afterwards, he strode away without looking back.

...

Watching Prime Minister Wang leave, the old eunuch exhaled a heavy breath of relief. He had been unnerved by Wang Zhengwen’s gaze, which carried a profound sense of disappointment.

He passed through the imperial study and entered the bedchamber, bowing low as he announced, “Your Majesty, the Prime Minister has departed.”

Emperor Yuanjing gave a soft hum of acknowledgment but did not open his eyes. With his eyes closed, he asked, “Who has gathered at the palace gates?”

The old eunuch replied in a low voice, “Everyone who should be there is present.”

Emperor Yuanjing sneered coldly. “I knew it. These scoundrels claw at each other most of the time, but half of it is merely for show. Detestable, loathsome—worthy of death!”

After venting his anger for a moment, he regained his composure and asked, “Has Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong arrived?”

The old eunuch thought for a moment and shook his head. “I don’t believe I saw him.”

Emperor Yuanjing closed his eyes again. After a long silence, just as the old eunuch thought the matter had been dropped, the emperor suddenly said, “Make a note of those who didn’t come today, and in the days to come, do the same.”

“Yes!”

...

At dusk, in the golden-red afterglow of the setting sun.

Xu Qi’an was leading his mare by the reins, while Xu Xinnian walked beside him with his own steed. They ambled along the street at a leisurely pace.

With them were Administrator Zheng Xinghuai and the Rank Five martial artist, Shentu Baili.

“Sir Zheng, are you staying at the courier station?” Xu Qi’an’s tone carried a hint of concern.

Given Zheng Xinghuai’s rank, he would certainly be lodging at a courier station within the inner city, where the security was excellent. Moreover, he was accompanied by close guards like Shentu Baili.

However, their current adversary was Emperor Yuanjing, and one could not be too cautious. A Rank Five Transforming Force martial artistwas hardly a deterrent in the capital.

“Elder brother, rest assured. The Zhenbei King’s massacre of the city has already placed His Majesty in the eye of the storm, as well as Lord Zheng,” Xu Xinnian said. “Even His Majesty wouldn’t act rashly at this time; it would provoke public outrage. One must heed the tide of events—it cannot be resisted.”

Zheng Xinghuai glanced at him in surprise. A hint of approval crossed his face, which was otherwise marked by bitterness. He said, “Silver Gong Xu, your cousin indeed has sharp insight. His calm and measured demeanour promises a bright future.”

Xu Xinnian smiled faintly.

*No, he simply had a habit of feigning composure and pretence. In truth, his inner resilience is average at best, and he often experienced social death. He is hardly the kind of grandmaster who could remain unshaken in the face of collapse…* Xu Qi’an thought to himself.

Unaware of Xu Qi’an’s internal monologue, Administrator Zheng continued, his tone tinged with nostalgia. “He reminds me of Duke Wei in his youth.”

*Please, Sir Zheng, did Duke Wei consent to this comparison…* Xu Qi’an tugged at the corners of his mouth, managing a forced smile, and ultimately chose to remain silent.

Some matters, once occurred, linger like a bone stuck in one’s throat until resolved.

“You need not worry,” Administrator Zheng said. “The courier station has been assigned a group of Nightwatchers. You understand.”

*So Duke Wei has already made arrangements to ensure Lord Zheng’s safety. That puts my mind at ease…* Xu Qi’an felt a weight lift from his chest.

“Farewell,” Administrator Zheng said, clasping his hands in farewell before leaving with Shentu Baili.

Xu Qi’an silently watched him depart. From Chuzhou to the capital, in just ten days, Zheng Xinghuai’s back had already begun to stoop, as though burdened by an invisible weight pressing him down.

*Sigh…* Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly. He stroked the smooth curve of his mare’s back and mounted her with a practiced motion.

As the sound of hooves echoed rhythmically, the two brothers slowly made their way home.

“Sir Zheng is a pitiable man,” Xu Qi’an remarked as the mare’s pace eased. “He passed the imperial examination in the 19th year of Yuanjing. According to Censor Liu, his father died young, and his widowed mother worked tirelessly to raise him. She laboured to send him to the National Academy, and he eventually earned the title of *Jinshi*. But years of hardship had taken their toll on her health, and she passed away before he could return home in triumph.”

Xu Qi’an continued, “Later, because of his rigidity and inability to adapt, he offended the former Prime Minister and was banished to Chuzhou. He spent eighteen years there, dedicating half his life to the region. And now, in a single night, it has all turned to dust.”

Xu Xinnian fell into a long silence. The pent-up frustration weighed heavily on his heart, leaving him feeling suffocated.

After a deep exhale, he muttered, “Eighteen years of trials and tribulations, half a lifetime’s achievements, reduced to ashes—only the dead are left to hear the tale.”

“Let’s not dwell on this,” Xu Qi’an said, as though to dispel the melancholy mood. He wore a roguish grin. “Xinnian, how have you gotten on with Miss Wang? Have you… uh, shared all your secrets?”

Xu Xinnian’s youthful face flushed as he retorted, “Using the word ‘gotten on’ is crude. I admit I’m fond of Miss Wang. She is erudite, cultured, and graceful, capable of discussing history and philosophy with me.

“Such a talented woman is rare. Apart from Princess Huaiqing, I’ve never met another like her. It’s only natural to feel a bit moved.”

*Ah, little brother, we share the same taste. I, too, admire talented women like Huaiqing. Oh, and also little fools like Lin’an, gluttons like Caiwei, heroines like Li Miaozhen, and pitiable souls like Zhong Li…*

“To be honest, I’ve had my doubts,” Xu Xinnian admitted. “Wang Zhengwen is Duke Wei’s political rival. He may not be willing to let Miss Wang marry me. And I haven’t made up my mind to marry her either.”

Xu Qi’an, abandoning his playful tone, mused aloud, “We’ve discussed this many times. There must be a separation between you and me.

“You tread your broad and open road; I cross my precarious bridge. Duke Wei, after all, is that precarious bridge. I understand your concerns—you’re worried Wang Zhengwen will force you to turn against me, leading to fratricide. Let me teach you a solution.”

Xu Xinnian humbly asked, “What is it, elder brother?”

Xu Qi’an chuckled. “Cherish your wife and hold her in esteem.”

“What do you mean by that, elder brother?”

“By marrying his daughter, you essentially have leverage over him. Unless Wang Zhengwen doesn’t care about this daughter, he won’t act heartlessly, no matter how strained your relationship becomes. Strike a balance, and you’ll always have the upper hand. Besides, you don’t need to fully depend on the Wang family. It’s simply about creating another path for the Xu family.”

“You have a point.” Xu Xinnian nodded slowly.

Seeing his brother deep in thought, Xu Qi’an smiled faintly. His gaze shifted forward, his mind drifting to the woman he had kept far away.

*It’s been days since we last met, and I find myself… raising her in my thoughts. The allure of the number one beauty in the Great Feng is peculiar. It’s not as overt as Luo Yuheng’s, but it works insidiously.*

*I wonder what her true origin is.*

*Hmm, first set the mistress aside as a confidante for now. Wait until the Zhenbei King’s matter is settled before meeting her. Before that, it’s best to proceed with caution.*

*Do not summon Zhong Li yet either; leave her at the Sitianjian. I’ll surely be going out frequently over the next few days, and taking her along would be inconvenient.*

*As for Lin’an and Huaiqing, they’ll have to wait too. I won’t be entering the palace for the time being, and this matter involves the royal family, so I’m indirectly entangled as well. Best to avoid them for now.*

While his thoughts wandered, he suddenly heard Xu Erlang ask in puzzlement, "Big Brother, what does 'share all your secrets' mean?"

At first, he thought it was his uncultured elder brother using the wrong expression, but the more he thought about it, the more something felt off, prompting him to ask.

Xu Qi’an considered for a moment before answering, "To tell if a man truly loves a woman, see if he’s willing to share everything."

"Is there such a saying?" Xu Xinnian asked. "Then how does one tell if a woman truly loves a man?"

Since his elder brother had broken into the Refining Spirit realm, his romantic encounters with stunning beauties seemed to multiply. In matters of love, Xu Xinnian had to admit he held his elder brother in high regard.

*Are you asking whether Wang Simu genuinely likes you?* Xu Qi’an pondered for a long while before replying, "Observe whether the woman is willing to welcome you with open ‘arms’."

*What kind of nonsense is this...* Xu Xinnian failed to grasp the meaning and spent the rest of the journey trying to figure it out.

…

"Big Bwother…"

When Xu Qi’an entered the residence and arrived at the inner hall, it happened to be dinnertime. Xu Lingyin, seeing her elder brother return after so long, abandoned her meal, sprinting with her short legs to collide joyfully into his arms.

Xu Qi’an staggered slightly, caught off guard.

After a month and a half apart, has Little Pea's strength grown this much?

"Have you been making your mother angry lately?" Xu Qi’an asked, holding the Little Pea as he walked into the inner hall.

"Huh? Do I often make Mum angry?" Xu Lingyin asked, surprised.

Clearly, she was such a a good child! Mum even says she doesn’t know what she did in her past life to end up with a child like Xu Lingyin.

Indeed, she thought herself different from her big brother, second brother, and sister.

To this day, Xu Lingyin hadn’t figured out the distinction between cousins and siblings, firmly believing her big brother was also born of her mother.

Xu Qi’an patted her head without saying anything.

*It seems the Strength Gu cultivation method can only enhance physical power and has no effect on intelligence, otherwise, Lina wouldn’t still be the way she is.*

Thinking this, he looked over at the tanned, small-framed girl from the Southern Marches, with hair ending in curls, sea-blue eyes, and finely sculpted features.

"You seem different," said the girl, scrutinising him.

"What’s different?" Xu Qi’an asked.

Lina thought for a moment, then shook her head. She couldn’t quite say, but felt his movements, the coordination of his body, and the way his muscles worked had all improved.

"Big Brother, you’re back!"

Naturally, the happiest to see him was Xu Lingyue. Her delicate oval face lit up with a smile as she personally served him rice and set the table.

Xu Xinnian hesitated for a moment but, seeing their younger sister pay him no mind, helped himself to the food.

"Good that you’re back."

Second Uncle, who had been observing his nephew intently, seeing him return safe and sound, with his spirits seemingly higher than before, finally broke into a grin.

"Hmm!"

The proud Auntie nodded in agreement, then added, "Lingyin, get down. Don’t delay your brother’s meal."

Today, Auntie wore a plain cross-collared blouse adorned with plump crabapple blossoms, much like her own curvaceous beauty, accentuating her full bosom and slender waist.

She paired it with a pale yellow cardigan, which lent her elegance and sophistication amidst her glamour.

After dinner, Xu Qi’an was invited into Xu Erlang’s study.

Unknowingly, the two brothers had begun to discuss important matters in private, excluding Second Uncle. Unlike the time they dealt with the Ministry of Revenue’s Assistant Minister Zhou Xianping, when all three men deliberated together.

Both brothers found this arrangement preferable. Second Uncle, after all, wasn’t skilled in intrigue. The more he knew, the more worried he’d become.

As an elder, his instinct was to solve problems rather than wait for his nephew and son to handle things.

Shielding one’s descendants from harm was a natural instinct for any elder. Unfortunately, Second Uncle wasn’t adept at these matters, and knowing more would only trouble him further.

…

The eastern wing.

Second Uncle sat at the table, took a sip of tea, and sighed, "Those two scoundrels think nothing of me now."

Auntie, dressed in her thin white blouse, sat cross-legged on the bed, playing with her jade bracelet. "What do you mean?"

Her long, shapely legs were crossed gracefully, presenting an enticing sight.

"Ah, a major incident happened in Chuzhou. Today, the officials were making a ruckus in the imperial city; it’s all anyone’s talking about," Second Uncle said, frowning.

"What kind of incident?" Auntie asked curiously.

"A woman’s place is not to meddle in such matters," Second Uncle snapped, glaring at her.

Just as the brothers didn’t want Second Uncle to worry, he didn’t want his wife fretting either. For a woman like her, who still fancied herself in the bloom of youth despite her years, ensuring her peace and happiness was enough.

…

"Big Brother, you haven’t yet told me the details of what happened in Chuzhou."

In the study, Xu Erlang held a cup of strong tea, seated beside the tea table.

Xu Qi’an stood by the window, gazing at the dark, silent courtyard, and slowly began, "The Chuzhou case is far more complicated than you think…"

He recounted the events in a calm tone, describing his experiences during the northern journey in detail, including his shared memory with Political Administrator Zheng and the vision of Chuzhou’s massacre.

His voice was steady, devoid of any emotional fluctuations.

Great sorrow bears no tears.

"So, so he was involved as well…"

Xu Xinnian was stunned. The little loyalty he had left for the emperor crumbled entirely, leaving nothing behind.

"The purpose of the delegation’s return to the capital is to expose the Zhenbei King’s crimes to the world. Ha! Administrator Zheng will not allow a beast like the Zhenbei King to be buried with the honours of a king and remembered as a National Guardian God of Great Feng," Xu Qi’an sneered.

Scholars valued their posthumous reputation above all else. If the Zhenbei King’s crimes couldn’t be confirmed, in Administrator Zheng’s eyes, the revenge would be incomplete, failing to truly seek justice for the people of Chuzhou.

"How does Cijiu think this 'battle' should be fought?" Xu Qi’an tested.

"You’re already doing it," Xu Xinnian replied. "Using the overwhelming tide of public opinion to pressure Emperor Yuanjing. Even an emperor cannot withstand the surge of the masses. He’s agreed to meet with Prime Minister Wang tomorrow, hasn’t he? We’ll see what comes of it."

"Unfortunately, there’s not much I can do in court politics. Relying on others for success is an uncomfortable feeling," Xu Qi’an sighed.

"Big Brother, you’ve already done enough…"

Xu Xinnian was about to offer further reassurance when his expression suddenly turned grim. Pausing for a long moment, his face grew increasingly serious.

"Big Brother, something seems amiss," he said.

Xu Qi’an turned to look at him.

Xu Xinnian said in a low voice, “According to what you’ve mentioned, if this case was indeed a conspiracy between Emperor Yuanjing and King Huai, then the delegation’s plan to catch him off guard was doomed to fail from the beginning.

“Don’t forget, Que Yongxiu has fled, and the Zhenbei King’s spies have also escaped. Would these people not send news of the Zhenbei King’s demise back to the capital? Perhaps, while you were feeling triumphant, he already received the news in advance.

“If that’s the case, Emperor Yuanjing must have already devised a countermeasure. Don’t underestimate him—our Majesty has played the game of power for so many years. If he takes this seriously, even Duke Wei and Prime Minister Wang might not be his match.”

“You’ve reminded me; indeed, that’s how it is.” Xu Qi’an turned his body back, facing the pitch-black courtyard, and said no more.

Xu Qi’an knew that the court wasn’t his battlefield. First, political struggles were not like solving cases, much less reliant solely on clever minds. Those who could emerge victorious from the imperial examination—who wasn’t intelligent?

And yet, each year, so many people rose and fell.

Xu Qi’an wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he could go head-to-head with Emperor Yuanjing in courtly battles.

Secondly, his rank was still too low; he didn’t even have the opportunity to attend court sessions, which meant he wasn’t qualified to be on the “front lines.”

“So, this time, the main players will have to be Duke Wei, Administrator Zheng, and those officials who are driven by fame, profit, or a residual sense of justice... Nonetheless, I can still contribute from outside the game.”

…

Stargazing Tower, Bagua Platform.

Clad in snow-white robes, with white hair and beard, the Jianzheng stood at the edge of the Eight Trigrams Platform, hands behind his back, gazing down at the entirety of the capital.

The night wind lifted the hem of his robes and stroked his beard. He seemed otherworldly, like an immortal exiled to the mortal realm.

“I heard the Zhenbei King perished in the Northern Territories.”

A deep voice sounded, low and steady, like an old friend engaging in casual conversation, carrying an air of mystery.

Behind the Jianzheng appeared a figure in white.

The Posturing King of the Great Feng, Yang QIanhuan.

The master and disciple stood back-to-back, both with hands behind their backs, both in snow-white robes. For a moment, it was hard to determine who was superior.

The Jianzheng let out an “hmm” and chuckled. “Some people are so pleased they might laugh themselves awake in their sleep.”

*Is the teacher referring to Duke Wei, or someone else...?* Yang Qianhuan mused, but outwardly maintained his air of detachment, mimicking the Jianzheng with a faint “hmm.”

The Jianzheng, long accustomed to his disciple’s temperament, paid him no mind. As long as Yang Qianhuan didn’t recite, “Where the seas end the heavens make shore, I stand atop the arcanist’s peak,” the Jianzheng couldn’t be bothered to argue.

Yang Qianhuan continued, “The one who killed the Zhenbei King was a mysterious expert, who fought alone against five great masters amidst the ruins of Chuzhou City. Before a crowd of witnesses, they slew the Zhenbei King, avenging the people’s grievances. Then, in a thousand-mile pursuit, they killed Jili Zhigu.

“It’s simply exhilarating! I wish I could have been in their place. But then, thinking of how Xu Ningyan didn’t get the spotlight either, I feel much better. Haha, that brat’s always snatching my opportunities—utterly detestable. Surely, he must have been green with envy watching that mysterious expert dominate the scene in Chuzhou.”

As he finished, Yang Qianhuan, relying on his intuition as a Rank Four arcanist, sensed his teacher uncharacteristically turning to look at him.

*Has my teacher finally started to feel ashamed of his past wrongs?* Yang Qianhuan thought gleefully.

The Jianzheng’s gaze was filled with pity.

…

The next day, the ministers once again gathered at the palace gates, staging a strike and causing a commotion. They felt as though they’d been toyed with.

After such a ruckus yesterday, they had thought the Emperor had conceded, inviting Prime Minister Wang inside for discussions. Yet, Wang’s reply was: “His Majesty did not meet with me.”

How absurd! Did the Emperor think that avoiding them would make the matter disappear?

As the incident snowballed, the Zhenbei King’s massacre of an entire city became more than just an issue within officialdom. Among the populace, the story had spread far and wide, shocking everyone.

Taverns, tea houses, and brothels—these hubs of information—were abuzz with people coming to listen or talk about the affair.

“How could the Zhenbei King be so heartless? 380,000 lives—an entire city! How could he bear to do it?” someone cursed, slamming the table in anger.

At this point, insulting the Zhenbei King had become politically correct. There was no fear of punishment because even the officials were cursing him. Anyone who refrained from doing so was viewed as a heartless beast.

Cursing the Zhenbei King now made one a scholar of virtue, a partner of justice.

“Do you know? The one who went to the Northern Territories to investigate was none other than Silver Gong Xu. If it weren’t for him, the Zhenbei King’s crimes would still be hidden.”

“There’s no case in this world that Silver Gong Xu can’t solve. With him around, I still believe the court is just—villains won’t get away with their crimes.”

“But I’ve heard that when it comes to court politics, Silver Gong Xu is powerless.”

“That’s no problem. The civil and military officials will naturally take over from Silver Gong Xu. Have you heard? His cousin, the one who topped the spring imperial examinations, spent four hours cursing outside the palace gates yesterday, until dusk. He’s there again today.”

“Amazing!”

…

In the imperial bedchamber.

The elderly eunuch stepped through the threshold, his head aching and his face pale with anger. “Your Majesty, that Xu Xinnian is ranting outside again. He’s truly infuriating and deserves to die!”

Emperor Yuanjing sat in his large chair, holding a Daoist scripture. Upon hearing this, he responded indifferently, “If we kill him, then the tide truly becomes unstoppable, and the wrath of the people will be upon us.”

The old Emperor’s face remained calm as he asked, “What did Duke Wei do last night?”

The elderly eunuch lowered his voice unconsciously. “Duke Wei privately went to see Prime Minister Wang...”

The implication was clear: the two great tigers of the court had formed a secret alliance.

Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen represented the two largest factions in the court. If they joined forces, no one could oppose them—not even the Emperor, who had suffered at their hands before.

Years ago, when the selling of official titles was at its peak, the two had worked together to extinguish it. Over five years, the officials appointed through bribery had been dismissed or executed under Prime Minister Wang’s purview, reclaiming most of the lost posts and titles.

The old Emperor smirked, seemingly disdainful, before asking, “Anything unusual in the palace?”

The elderly eunuch replied cautiously, “All is calm. However, Princess Lin’an returned to the palace yesterday. As for Princess Huaiqing...”

The old Emperor narrowed his eyes. “What about Huaiqing?”

“She left the palace and returned to her residence.”

After a long silence, the old Emperor acknowledged with a faint “hmm” and instructed, “If Lin’an seeks an audience later, send her back.”

…

On the third day.

The ministers were still gathered at the palace gates, but observant individuals noticed that although the numbers remained the same, some of the high-ranking officials with real power were absent.

Xu Qi’an, stationed at the Nightwatcher’s Constabulary, received a visit from the head guard of Princess Huaiqing’s residence. On orders of the eldest princess, the guard invited Xu Qi’an to the princess’s estate for a discussion.
