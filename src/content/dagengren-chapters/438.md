# 438. Night Meeting of the Heaven and Earth Society

Xu Qi’an turned his head, and saw a pair of glittering peach-blossom eyes, so charming, so attractive, that it captured one’s whole attention.

Eyes are the windows to the soul, the most expressive of the features. Women whose beauty stirs the heart often have eyes brimming with spirit and life.

Lin’an had just such peach-blossom eyes. Yet when she looked at you, her gaze became soft and hazy, full of flirtatious emotion.

And when those eyes gazed at you like that, you couldn’t bear to tease her. You’d even be willing to cut out your own heart and offer it to her.

Xu Qi’an had originally intended to tease her, but changed his mind. He chuckled softly and said, “No, the military treatise was written by me. It has nothing to do with Duke Wei.”

Biaobiao burst into delighted laughter. She had received the answer she hoped for and was thoroughly pleased.

“Then why did you lie to Huaiqing?”

Lin’an bounced lightly on her feet, her red dress fluttering like a wave of fire.

“Because Her Highness Huaiqing is too self-assured. Once she believes something, it’s hard to change her mind. And since I had never shown any skill in military strategy before, it was perfectly reasonable for her to assume the treatise was written by Duke Wei.”

Xu Qi’an explained.

“In other words, she doesn’t trust you. But I do! I trust whatever you say.” Lin’an huffed proudly.

_Innocence does have its virtues…_ thought Xu Qi’an.

If a girl like that meets a decent man, she’ll live a happy life. But if she encounters a scoundrel, her heart will be played like a toy.

Xu Qi’an never played with a girl’s heart, he much preferred their bodies.

Before leaving the imperial city, Xu Qi’an glanced back at the palace deep within.

_If there really is a hidden tunnel leading from the outside into the palace, where could it be? And what secret did Master Hengyuan uncover that forced Emperor Yuanjing to launch a sweeping manhunt?_

…

Outside the Imperial Academy, on a raised platform, a Confucian student stood speaking passionately, spittle flying, recounting the events of the literary gathering.

“That barbarian Peiman Xilou was indeed very learned. In studies of heaven and earth? In morality and policy? He could debate the young scholars of the Hanlin academy and hold his own. When the scholars of the Hanlin academy were out of choices, the great scholar of Cloud Deer Academy Zhang Shen — Zhang Jinyan arrived…”

A crowd of commoners below listened eagerly. At this, they finally let out a breath and laughed.

“With a great scholar of Cloud Deer Academy there, it must have been a sure win. That barbarian can’t have kept his arrogance after that.”

“Indeed! Everyone knows Cloud Deer Academy’s scholars are as lofty as the Stargazing Tower.”

The Confucian student atop the stage shook his head with a sigh. “No. Even Zhang Shen of Cloud Deer Academy lost. Who would’ve thought that barbarian would produce a military treatise? Upon reading it, Master Zhang Shen willingly admitted defeat.”

The crowd erupted in shock and outrage.

“Even a great scholar of Cloud Deer Academy lost?”

“He really lost to a barbarian? Outrageous! Are all Great Feng’s scholars useless?”

“I’m furious. This is worse than last year’s delegation from the Buddhist sect!”

The city folk hurled abuse without restraint.

The student raised his hands for calm. “Don’t be so quick to anger. If the gathering had ended in defeat, would I be standing here now?”

But rather than calming down, the people became even more impatient.

“Just tell us already! Stop beating around the bush!”

“If even the great scholar of Cloud Deer Academy lost, who was it that finally beat the barbarian?”

The student grinned. “No rush. Listen carefully. At that moment, a young official from the Hanlin Academy stepped forward and challenged Peiman Xilou to a debate on military strategy. His name was Xu Xinnian, younger cousin to Silver Gong Xu…”

He animatedly recounted how Xu Xinnian presented the treatise and won over Peiman Xilou.

The crowd broke into cheers, shouting raucous praise, exclaiming that the brother of a tiger is no mere dog, the two Xu brothers were all outstanding talents.

The student deliberately paused, a mischievous glint in his eyes as he watched the crowd shower Xu Xinnian with praise. Then, with a sudden turn of tone, he shouted, “Do you know who wrote the treatise?”

The crowd fell silent, staring at him blankly.

He raised his voice. “It was Silver Gong Xu, our Great Feng’s foremost poet, Xu Qi’an!”

A wave of astonishment swept through the faces below. Then it turned to excitement and wild joy.

Thanks to the students of the Imperial Academy singing Xu Qi’an’s praises far and wide, news of his military treatise subduing the barbarian rapidly spread through the capital.

The commoners didn’t really care about Peiman Xilou’s scholarly knowledge. They only knew he’d been arrogant lately, even the Imperial Academy had been humiliated.

They’d originally pinned their hopes on the great scholars of Cloud Deer Academy to humble the barbarian. But when they heard that even those esteemed scholars had been defeated, they were shocked and furious, lamenting the shame and frustration.

But in the very next breath, their anger turned to jubilation.

Silver Gong Xu had made his younger cousin present a treatise, which instantly subdued the barbarian.

Another chapter had been added to Xu Qi’an’s already legendary story.

The storytellers at the teahouses were thrilled, they finally had new material. While the tales of Xu Qi’an defeating the Buddhist delegation and standing against eight thousand rebels remained popular, the crowds had heard them too many times.

Now, finally, they could tell something different.

…

Not long after Xu Qi’an and Lin’an left, Huaiqing also departed the imperial city. She rode in an opulent, extravagantly costly carriage and arrived at the Nightwatchers Constabulary.

After announcing herself, she ascended to the seventh floor of the Tower of Noble Spirit in her long gown, graceful and stately, where she found Wei Yuan.

He stood before a geographic chart, scrutinising it without turning around. With a faint smile, he said, “Your Highness, what brings you to my humble quarters?”

Huaiqing offered a formal bow. In front of Wei Yuan, she always regarded herself as a junior, never pulling rank.

“We’ve come to request a book,” she said, her voice cool and clear.

Wei Yuan returned to his desk and picked up a brush. “I’ll write Your Highness a personal note. Whatever you need, fetch it from the archives.”

Huaiqing shook her head. Her eyes sparkled with hope. “We wish to see that military treatise. You are a master of strategy, yet have never left any written works. That is a true loss. If a treatise by you were to be published, it would be a blessing to Great Feng.”

Wei Yuan slowly shook his head, his tone gentle. “That treatise wasn’t written by me.”

*Not by him?* Huaiqing’s expression froze. Her eyes went blank for a moment as she stared at Wei Yuan. A few seconds later, her gaze refocused, emotions crashing like waves within her.

The treatise truly came from Xu Qi’an. If he was so well-versed in strategy, why had he never mentioned it before? Why had he hidden it so thoroughly?

Shocked, she also felt a little aggrieved. Xu Qi’an had deliberately said nothing, letting her embarrass herself in front of Wei Yuan.

Wei Yuan chuckled. “To tell the truth, I almost want to take him to the battlefield. With a prodigy like that, after a few years of tempering the Great Feng would have another brilliant commander.”

Huaiqing composed herself and smiled faintly. “Why not sneak him off?”

Wei Yuan lowered his gaze and softly said, “I’m not taking him.”

…

The Sitianjian, Bagua Platform.

The Jianzheng sat on the eastern side, Yang Qianhuan on the western. The master and disciple had their backs to each other, no embrace in sight.

“Not bad. You’ve got a basic grasp of the formations you need. At most three years, and you can try advancing to become a Master of Heaven's Secrets,” the Jianzheng nodded slightly, speaking in an amused tone.

“What are the requirements to become a Master of Heaven's Secrets?” Yang Qianhuan asked with great interest.

He had lingered at fourth rank for five years, it truly was time to move forward. His many failed attempts to imitate Xu Qi’an had taught him a valuable lesson.

Mortals have limits. If he wanted to surpass Xu Qi’an, then he could not remain a mortal.

“Observe the stars for three years. If comprehension arises, then inscribe a formation and conceal yourself for three more,” the Jianzheng said slowly.

“Six years without going outside? Or meeting anyone?”

“Six years is the fastest possible pace. If your comprehension is lacking, it could be six years and another six, or until your life ends, there’s still no guarantee of advancement.” The Jianzheng took a sip of wine and sighed. 

“To transcend the mortal realm… is hardly so simple.”

Yang Qianhuan replied with conviction, “Master, I just want to remain a mortal. Being a Master of Heaven's Secrets? Forget it.”

The Jianzheng said nothing more.

Just then, light footsteps sounded on the steps. A petite beauty in a yellow dress climbed up to the Bagua Platform, eyes shining.

“Senior Brother Yang, the literary gathering’s over. Our Great Feng won!”

Yang Qianhuan replied coolly, “Junior Sister Caiwei, I have no interest in such dull gatherings of scholars.”

Chu Caiwei blinked. “Xu Qi’an made a move too.”

Yang Qianhuan instantly blinked to her side, the back of his head burning with intensity as he stared at her.

“Xu Qi’an made a move? He recited a poem? Hah, how enviable. Still, this literary gathering was focused on military strategy. He was likely just a supporting role. Forcing in a poem to get attention, such showmanship is trivial. Xu Qi’an has clearly fallen.”

*Isn’t forcing in poems for attention exactly what you do, Senior Brother…?* Chu Caiwei silently grumbled, then snorted.

“Xu Qi’an didn’t recite anything. He didn’t even attend.”

Yang Qianhuan gave a noncommittal “Mm?” to express confusion.

Chu Caiwei chirped, “He wrote a military treatise and had Xu Erlang present it at the gathering. After reading it, Peiman Xilou admitted defeat and even offered to be his disciple. That treatise is all the rage now… Huh? Senior Brother, what’s wrong?”

“Xu… Xu Ningyan’s public display of talent has advanced again, reaching new heights. He’s perfected it… he’s perfected it!” Yang Qianhuan exclaimed excitedly.

*What’s he going on about now?* Chu Caiwei glanced at the back of his head and said:

“He only did that because he offended His Majesty and had no choice. Otherwise, knowing Xu Ningyan’s nature, he’d be bragging about it all over the capital.”

“No, no, you don’t understand!”

Yang Qianhuan protested fiercely, waving his arms in agitation.

“The true pinnacle of public displays of brilliance is just like this. He never even appeared, and yet he stunned the gathering. He never showed his face, and yet he subdued the northern savages. He did absolutely nothing, said absolutely nothing, and still stirred a great storm in the capital.

“Xu Ningyan, oh Xu Ningyan… you are the rival of my life! One day, I will surpass you, trample you underfoot. I will master everything you know. The more flamboyant you are, the more I’ll learn. One day, you’ll regret it!”

Chu Caiwei blinked innocently and said, “Then, Senior Brother, you should start by writing a military treatise.”

Yang Qianhuan froze in place like a lifeless statue.

After a moment, he muttered, “Mortals truly do have limits. Master… I, I no longer want to be a mortal…”

*The mortal world is not worth it!* the Jianzheng sighed in melancholy.

…

Late at night.

Xu Qi’an lay on his bed, with the petite Zhong Li sitting on his back. Using her superb acupressure skills, Physician Zhong was helping Xu Qi’an relax his meridians and invigorate his blood. In short: a Great Feng massage therapy.

“Ahh, that’s comfy…”

With a half-sigh, half-moan, Xu Qi’an praised her handiwork. “You know, I’m also very skilled in acupressure. It’s just that since Fuxiang left, no lady has been fortunate enough to experience it. Senior Sister Zhong, would you like to be that lucky one?”

Zhong Li silently shook her head. She didn’t understand what he was saying, but shaking her head felt like the right response.

Xu Qi’an grew a little annoyed. “Then don’t sit on me. Your arse is huge, you’re squashing me.”

“Oh…”

Zhong Li gave a soft response, climbed off him, and shuffled back to her little bed in embroidered shoes.

Once she was dealt with, Xu Qi’an took out his fragment of the Earth Book. Under the dim candlelight on the table, he sent a message:

【My big brother went to the Nightwatchers' Office today and found that all the slave traders under Earl Pingyuan had already been executed.】

【TWO: Heh, well done to your big brother.】

Chu Yuanzhen didn’t see Li Miaozhen’s sarcasm. Thinking she was genuinely praising Xu Qi’an’s brilliance, he replied:

【Actually, I suspect the military treatise was written by Wei Yuan, merely presented through Brother Ningyan as a way to strike at the southern tribes. As for Hengyuan, I’ve thought it over, Yuanjing captured Master Hengyuan, but Daoist Jinlian was confident he wouldn’t die.

【So if I were Yuanjing, I’d seal him somewhere I could keep an eye on. Now, where can Yuanjing see clearly but no one else can find?】

【TWO: The palace!】

Lady Flying Swallow answered cleverly.

Chu Yuanzhen continued:【Miaozhen’s right, but based on Xu Ningyan’s intel, King Huai’s spies didn’t enter the palace that day. Not even the imperial city.】

Xu Qi’an’s heart stirred.【You’re saying there’s a secret passage to the palace from the inner city?】

Chu Yuanzhen replied:

【That’s my thought too. But there’s a puzzling issue—you’ve all seen the geomantic map of the capital, right? Between the inner city and the palace is the imperial city. From any gate in the inner city, galloping at full speed still takes half an hour to reach the imperial city. Then from there into the palace, it’s far too long. I just don’t believe such a long tunnel exists.】

*At that point, it would no longer be a tunnel but a full-blown underground highway…* Xu Qi’an nodded slowly.

Digging such a tunnel, and doing so in secret — after all, even Emperor Yuanjing couldn’t have done it openly — would require terrifying manpower and resources. And the capital was densely packed with people. If you dug under someone’s house, it would have been noticed immediately.

Chu Yuanzhen messaged again:【My theory is: could there be an earth-travelling spell involved?】

【TWO: First of all, earth-travelling spells are hard to master. Very few people can use them. And they can only be cast in areas with ley lines.】

【FIVE: What are ley lines?】

Lina dutifully played the role of pawn.

【TWO: ley lines are… well, they’re ley lines. I can’t explain, but an arcanist could. They’re experts in feng shui. They’d know. Or maybe our learned Number Three can explain.】

*Miaozhen knows Zhong Li’s in my room. She’s hinting I should ask her…*

*Lady Flying Swallow, you’re a true friend. You even held back your embarrassment to cover for me. Mwah…* Xu Qi’an turned his head and looked at Zhong Li on her little bed. “Do you know what ley lines are?”
