# 318. Auntie and Miss Wang's Ranged Duel

Within the dim corridor, beyond the bars, his older brother stood there in his Nightwatcher uniform, squinting at him.

Erlang’s eyes lit up instantly, and he got up from the straw mat, the chains clinking as he moved.

“How did you get in? How could Minister Sun even allow you?” Xu Xinnian was both surprised and delighted.

Seeing this, Xu Qi’an relaxed, withdrew his scrutinising gaze, and exhaled. *Seems like it’s only superficial injuries.*

Then, he glanced at the jailer and said coolly, “You’re dismissed.”

The jailer wisely retreated.

Xu Xinnian spat and cursed, “Those bitches, their whips sting like hell.”

*Is Erlang complaining to me…* Xu Qi’an nodded. “Rest assured, Big Brother will find a way to get you out.”

Just has he finished, Xu Xinnian waved him off, emphasizing, “Big Brother, you may not fully understand, but this isn’t just a cheating scandal—it’s the clash between the Imperial Academy and Cloud Deer Academy.”

*No, I understand it perfectly…* Xu Qi’an thought to himself.

But Erlang didn’t give him a chance to speak, chattering on, full of conviction and spirit, obviously only suffering minor injuries.

“Actually, I anticipated this. A student from Cloud Deer Academy achieving the huiyuan in the metropolitan exam, how could things be just allowed to be? But I’m not afraid. For Cloud Deer Academy to return to the court and expand its influence, someone must lead the charge and pave the way for those to come.” Xu Xinnian said gravely, “And I am that person blazing the trail.”

*Oh, Erlang, people don’t admire the first to blaze the trail—they admire the one who widens it…* Xu Qi’an gave a quiet nod, “Go on.”

“I’ve actually figured out how to solve this,” Xu Xinnian continued proudly, “After all, the schemes and intrigues of the court are my expertise.”

Raising his chin in pride, he went on, “The academy’s great Confucians can’t meddle in court affairs without official rank. But Wei Yuan can. You should go seek his help. I don’t expect him to exonerate me immediately—that would be too difficult and could cause severe backlash, as it’s akin to declaring war on the entire court of officials.

“My request is simply this: strip my honors but let me retain the right to take the imperial exams. Or keep me detained until after the final imperial exam, and I’ll take the metropolitan exam again in three years.

“The Imperial Academy officials are aiming to suppress Cloud Deer Academy, not just me.”

He paused and, seeing his elder brother’s stunned look, sighed, “Yes, I know this might be hard for big brother to grasp. Just do as I say. Even in confinement, I can still strategize.”

*Oh, Erlang, you think you’re on level eighteen, but you’re really only scratching the surface…* Xu Qi’an cleared his throat. “Big Brother has a different take on things.”

Xu Xinnian was taken aback, and then, in a “humble” gesture, he nodded, “Let’s hear it.”

Xu Qi’an then relayed Wei Yuan’s “three birds with one stone” analysis to Xu Xinnian, and the cell sank into a long silence.

“So that’s it… there’s such a complex web of schemes behind this. Am I… am I doomed?” Xu Xinnian looked devastated.

It was unclear whether his despair stemmed from his predicament or the realization that his earlier analysis had been overly shallow, belying his self-proclaimed high rank in political scheming.

“Rest assured, Brother will do everything possible to get you out,” Xu Qi’an consoled him.

This was not the place for lengthy discussions.

Xu Xinnian let out a bitter laugh.

…

Bidding farewell to Xu Xinnian, Xu Qi’an decided to return home to reassure his sister and auntie. He’d been out all day, and the two women at home must have been anxious all this time.

From afar, he heard Auntie crying in the hall, “Why hasn’t Dalang come back? Erlang’s locked up in the Ministry of Law; who knows what kind of suffering he’s enduring… we at least deserve some word…”

Xu Lingyue comforted her, “Mother, Big Brother must be working hard to make connections. Don’t worry. He’ll let us know when he comes home in the evening.”

“How much longer must we wait? Every passing minute is tormenting me.” Auntie sobbed, “Didn’t you hear what your father said? Dalang went to the Ministry of Law to plead for help, but he was rebuffed and humiliated.”

Then came Xu Pingzhi’s sigh.

*Although Auntie could be petty and thought of herself as a “little cutie” despite her age, she hadn’t berated Second Uncle for failing to save her son. No wonder Second Uncle spoils her so much…* Xu Qi’an suddenly noticed this endearing detail he hadn’t seen before.

“Ahem!”

Xu Qi’an coughed as he entered, drawing the family’s attention.

Xu Lingyue, who had clearly been calm and collected just a minute before, suddenly had tears welling up in her eyes. She looked at Xu Qi’an, unable to speak.

Seeing her, Xu Qi’an patted her shoulder and said gently, “Don’t worry.”

Xu Lingyue whispered softly, “Big Brother…”

Then Auntie’s voice, loud and piercing, drowned her out. She looked at him with a mix of expectation and worry, crying, “Ningyan, how is Erlang? Please, find a way to save him! Only you can help him.”

Xu Pingzhi heaved another sigh.

“I’ve seen Erlang; he’s fine and hasn’t been seriously hurt.” Xu Qi’an patted Auntie’s hand, then Lingyue’s, trying to comfort them.

Auntie looked at him intently, tears glistening in her eyes. “Dalang, you’re not lying to me, are you?”

Ignoring Auntie, Xu Qi’an turned to Second Uncle and spoke in a low voice, “I’ve had to take unconventional measures’—I’ve kidnapped Minister Sun’s son.”

Xu Pingzhi’s face turned pale. “Ningyan, you’ve broken the rules.”

“Rest assured; he has no evidence. I didn’t ask him to clear Erlang’s name. That would be too risky and would spiral out of control. I merely insisted he avoid using torture. For Minister Sun, this is a minor concession. And when weighed against a life-or-death standoff, he cares far more for his son’s life.”

Though this had indeed broken the rules, handled with caution, the fallout would be limited.

Moreover, Minister Sun truly had no evidence. After all, it wasn’t Xu Qi’an who personally took his son. Not to mention, he wasn’t concerned about Sitianjian’s Qi-watching technique.

In the Princess Pingyang’s case, King Yu had had no evidence when his daughter vanished without a trace—he didn’t even know who his enemy was.

Of course, in the end, the Liang Clique paid with the annihilation of their entire house.

*As long as it works, even if it was a rule enshrined in the laws of the Great Feng, some would still take risks—let alone an unspoken rule!*

With that thought, Xu Qi’an looked over at Lina and Xu Lingyin, who were casually enjoying snacks, and said, "Don’t go out today, either of you. Lina, during the day, the safety of the women in the household depends on you."

"Got it!" Lina agreed cheerfully.

*Though this little dark-skinned girl wasn’t too bright, she really can fight…* Xu Qi’an trusted her well enough.

As for being ostracised by the bureaucracy—whether or not Minister Sun would spread word of this incident didn’t matter. He wasn’t afraid. As Wei Yuan’s trusted confidant, Xu Qi’an already had plenty of enemies.

Afraid of being isolated?

Xu Qi’an wasn’t an official scholar on the path to fame; he was a Nightwatcher. The two roles were fundamentally different. The former required reputation and acceptance in the officialdom. A Nightwatcher didn’t.

As long as Wei Yuan stood, he would too. If Wei Yuan fell, so would he.

Xu Pingzhi opened his mouth, but offered no opinion. He felt both a bittersweet loss and relief—a relief that his nephew had grown and was no longer the boy whose head he used to pat so casually.

But a little regret—he could never pat the back of that head again.

Auntie, meanwhile, cried with joy, gripping Xu Qi’an’s hand tightly. "Dalang, you really are the most promising one in this family. It wasn’t in vain that I raised you so diligently."

*Really? Auntie, are you sure your conscience doesn’t ache saying that?* Xu Qi’an wondered skeptically.

Xu Lingyue whispered, "But… what about the aftermath?"

Auntie’s joy froze on her face, suddenly reminded—right, there’s still the aftermath.

"I’ll figure something out," Xu Qi’an replied solemnly.

The second step Wei Yuan had taught him was still brewing in his mind, a half-formed idea.

Disheartened, Auntie took Xu Lingyin away. Her jade-like fingers poked the little girl on the forehead as she chided, "All you know is eating. Why did I even give birth to you? I’d have been better off birthing a rat."

"But mum, I’m hungry," Xu Lingyin protested, looking up pitifully.

"When are you ever full?" Auntie snapped, disappointed. "Your big brother’s in trouble, and you’re still here eating without a care in the world. Thoughtless creature."

Xu Lingyin glanced at Xu Qi’an. "But big bwother is fine. Mum just doesn’t want to give me food. She wants to hide it and eat it all herself."

Auntie wobbled with anger.

Xu Qi’an, Xu Lingyue, and Xu Pingzhi felt awkward.

Lina nudged her eating buddy and whispered, "You have another big brother too, remember?"

Xu Lingyin thought for a moment, realising she indeed had another brother, and immediately started bawling, crumbs falling from her mouth.

"Is second brother dead too? I don’t want second brother to die! Waaa…"  

Just then, the Gatekeeper Old Zhang came in and announced, "There’s a young lady outside, asking to see Miss Lingyue."

The whole family turned to Xu Lingyue.

Xu Lingyue furrowed her brows slightly. "A young lady? Which family is she from? What does she want with me?"

Old Zhang shook his head.

"Bring her in," Xu Lingyue said.

After a moment, Old Zhang returned, leading in a young woman in a pink dress. She wore her hair in a servant girl’s style, though her clothes were of finer material than those of an ordinary wealthy lady.

"It’s you?" Xu Lingyue recognised her, looking surprised.

"The servant’s name is Lan’er. My lady wished to visit Miss Lingyue today, if Miss Lingyue is available," said the graceful maid called Lan’er, curtseying.

"This is the maid of Miss Wang Simu, the daughter of Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen," Xu Lingyue explained.

She trusted her elder brother’s sharpness to catch the implication.

*Wang Zhenwen’s daughter’s maid? What is she doing here? Here to mock us?* Influenced by Erlang, Xu Qi’an assumed Wang Simu had come to gloat, kicking someone while they were down.

He was suddenly a bit annoyed.

*Just a girl, and she dares to be so arrogant... I, a staunch advocate of gender equality, will not hesitate to deal with green tea schemers…* Xu Qi’an scoffed inwardly.

"I have plans today. Perhaps I can visit her another day," Xu Lingyue said coldly, her gaze suddenly sharp. "Please tell Sister Wang that I’m rather fond of her and would love a good chat next time."

In the next instant, however, her gaze softened, transforming her back into a delicate younger sister. With teary eyes, she said, "Big Brother, if you have things to handle, please go. Erlang’s matter is in your hands."

Just as Xu Qi’an was about to nod, Lan’er, looking worried, asked, "What’s happened to Huiyuan Xu?"

The siblings ignored her, their expressions icy, when suddenly Auntie spoke up:

"Your young lady is the daughter of the Prime Minister? Oh, that’s wonderful! My Erlang has been falsely accused of exam fraud and locked in the dungeons of the Ministry of Law. Young lady, could you please ask your young mistress to help Erlang?"

Xu Qi’an and Xu Lingyue froze, horrified, looking at Auntie.

*Is mum (auntie) really this clueless?*

*In desperation, you don’t go running to the enemy for help! Does she want us to die faster, for them to twist the knife?*

Xu Qi’an’s expression darkened as he said icily, "Lan’er, goodbye."

The puzzled and increasingly anxious maid finally left.

…

Wang Simu sat on the plush couch of the spacious carriage, occasionally lifting the curtain to glance outside or checking the orange embers licking the teapot at the bottom. Her anxious heart was on full display.

Over half an hour had passed, and that wretched girl Lan’er still hadn’t returned. Waiting was the hardest part.

If the Xu family’s young lady rejected her visit, it likely represented the family’s stance—and by extension, Xu Xinnian’s stance as well.

*Should I keep visiting, or should I back down?*

Backing down didn’t sit well with her; but if she pressed forward… she was, after all, an unmarried young lady, the Prime Minister’s daughter. She had to consider her reputation and couldn’t just keep knocking at their door.

As her thoughts flitted about, she lifted the curtain and was delighted to spot Lan’er’s little carriage approaching.

The carriage rolled to a stop, and the maid Lan’er hopped down nimbly, hurrying over, climbing up, and entering Wang Simu’s grand carriage.

“You troublesome girl! Coming back so late—do you even know the time?” Wang Simu snapped, venting her restlessness.

Taking a deep breath, she asked, “What did the Xu family’s young lady say?”

Lan’er shook her head.

Wang Simu’s face instantly fell, the brightness in her eyes fading.

She then noticed Lan’er swallowing nervously and, after catching her breath, said, “Miss, it’s serious—Huiyuan Xu was arrested by the Ministry of Law for cheating on the civil service exam.”

“What?”

Upon hearing the news, Wang Simu was flooded with mixed emotions. First came shock and concern for Xu Xinnian’s future and safety.

And then… a small surge of relief.

*So, he hadn’t come because he was indifferent to me, but because he was detained by the Ministry of Law and couldn’t break free.*

*I misjudged him.*

With that, Lan’er recounted everything she had seen and heard at the Xu mansion, including Xu Qi’an’s icy demeanour and Xu Lingyue’s aloof posture.

*Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law is in the same clique as my father. So, they think my father’s behind this? If my father really was the one orchestrating it, then… wouldn’t that make me…?* Wang Simu felt a pang of bitterness.

Lan’er huffed indignantly, “They’re so rude and yet expect you to help Huiyuan Xu. The Xu family truly has no shame.”

Wang Simu frowned. “Mind your words.” She paused, her expression turning serious. “Did Xu Qi’an ask for this?”

*No, that can’t be right. I’ve only met Huiyuan Xu once and exchanged just a few words. Xu Qi’an is a clever man—there’s no way he’d ask me, the Prime Minister’s daughter, for help.*

*There’s no way he could know what I’m thinking. Not even Father knows.*

The astute Miss Wang quickly sensed something was amiss.

Lan’er shook her head. “It was a request from the lady of the Xu family, that beautiful woman we saw that day.”

*The Xu family’s matron made this request…*

Wang Simu’s expression turned solemn as she ruminated, analysing and considering…

*She is Huiyuan Xu’s mother. Faced with such a situation, she must have a poor opinion of me, of the Wang family. Why, then, would she ask me for help?*

*A woman who could raise a daughter with such deep wit, a nephew of unrivaled valor, and a son of extraordinary talent—she’s no ordinary woman.*

*I must think carefully, very carefully; I cannot be careless…*

“Lan’er, did that matron… say anything negative about me, or my father? What was her attitude?” Wang Simu asked.

“She was the politest of the whole family. She made the request very earnestly,” Lan’er replied.

*This…* Wang Simu’s eyes widened slightly, a possible answer dawning on her.

*The first time I invited Huiyuan Xu to a literary gathering under my father’s name, there was nothing unusual about it. But then, I invited him again, almost immediately, to go boating… As a careless man, he might not think much of it, but a woman—a wise woman—could hardly miss the hint of something more.*

*Even if she couldn’t be sure of my intentions, she could still suspect… so, this request might be both a test and an opportunity?*

*She doesn’t hold ill will toward me; she doesn’t resent or despise me for being the Prime Minister’s daughter.*

*By making this request, she’s giving me a hint.*

*Indeed, the Xu family’s matron is a woman of great wisdom… She’s the only one in the family who has seen through my feelings…* Wang Simu clenched her delicate fists, her body even trembling a little.

And at the same time, she felt a thrill at meeting a worthy opponent.

“Lan’er, go to the palace. I’m going to the constabulary to find my father,” Wang Simu declared, enunciating each word.
