# 430. The Story Between The Lines

Seeing Number Three’s message, the group fell silent for a moment. It wasn’t hard to understand his words.

Compared to Human Sect’s honorary disciple Chu Yuanzhen; Heaven Sect Holy Maiden Li Miaozhen; the on-the-surface loyal dog of Wei Yuan but in reality his son, and seemingly a crude martial artist but in fact a private disciple of Dean Zhao Shou Xu Qi’an;

Number Six Hengyuan was merely an insignificant insect that could be crushed at any time.

It was no surprise that Emperor Yuanjing would send people after him.

【SIX: THREE is right. I think so too. I have always treated others with kindness. Aside from the Emperor, I have offended no one else.】

【FOUR: Master Hengyuan, once day breaks, you should leave the capital immediately. I will keep an eye on the welfare hall for you. Their target is you. If you are no longer there, the children and elders will be safe.】

Chu Yuanzhen gave a reasonable suggestion.

At that moment, Number One, who had not spoken in the Earth Book chat for a long time, suddenly sent a message:

【ONE: His Majesty needs only an excuse to act against you. Perhaps, out of consideration for Luo Yuheng, he has not yet made a move against you.

【If you remain obedient, he will turn a blind eye. But if you interfere, you may provoke his retaliation. The same applies to Heaven Sect Holy Maiden. I do not recommend that you get involved.】

【TWO: Damn that Emperor Yuanjing! Once I reach Rank One, I’ll enter the capital and stab him to death!】

*Miaozhen, that statement of yours is just like when I used to say, "I'll start dieting tomorrow"—forever just words with no action...* Xu Qi’an silently lampooned.

Li Miaozhen was only Rank Four in combat strength, she couldn’t even break into the palace. By the time she reached Rank One, she would have already severed all ties to the mortal world. At that point, she wouldn't care about killing the Emperor anymore.

Unexpectedly, Number One ignored Li Miaozhen’s treasonous outburst and continued:

【ONE: I will have someone watch over the welfare hall. But I will only observe.】

*Only observe? That meant that no matter what happened, he would not take action...* The group understood Number One’s stance and did not hold it against him.

Number One was part of the court. He (or she) could not openly oppose Emperor Yuanjing. If the Emperor caught him interfering in this matter, he would be in grave danger.

After concluding the Heaven and Earth Society’s internal meeting, Xu Qi’an put away his Earth Book fragment. He glanced at Zhong Li, who was curled up on her small couch, her peach-shaped bottom slightly raised. Seeing her, he couldn’t help but think of Yang Qianhuan.

*How did Senior Brother Yang endure back then?*

*Could it be that those dark, humiliating experiences of his youth shaped his current obsession with showing off?*

*If that were the case, would Senior Sister Zhong turn out the same way in the future?*

Imagining what Zhong Li might become, Xu Qi’an thought to himself, _One must endure hardship to rise above others. It’s better for Senior Sister Zhong to keep suffering..._

*Master Hengyuan will have some trouble soon. His cultivation isn’t weak, but he’s still below Rank Four. Getting involved in such high-level conflicts is dangerous.*

*In our Heaven and Earth Society, aside from the mysterious Number One, Hengyuan is the most unremarkable member…*

*But Daoist Jinlian must have had a reason for recruiting him. I just don’t know what’s special about him yet... No, unique.*

*I haven’t noticed any uniqueness, but he is pitiful, that’s for sure. His junior brother was murdered, and in Qinglong Temple, he didn’t fit in either…*

Thinking about this, Xu Qi’an gradually drifted into sleep.

In the latter half of the night, a flash of lightning split the sky, illuminating the world in an eerie brightness, followed by a deafening clap of thunder.

Xu Qi’an jolted awake and sat up abruptly.

Zhong Li was also startled awake. Like a vigilant little rabbit, she lifted her head and looked around nervously.

Then, through her messy hair, her dark, gem-like eyes saw Xu Qi’an quickly putting on his shoes, getting out of bed, and lighting a candle on the table. The warm orange glow filled the room with a gentle light.

_Pitter patter..._

A sudden downpour arrived with great force, pelting the roof and windows, creating a cacophony of sound.

The entire world was engulfed in the sound of rain.

Outside, the summer night raged with torrential rain, but inside, the candlelight flickered softly, casting warm tones over the room. Zhong Li couldn't help but wriggle slightly, looking at the man seated at the table. An inexplicable sense of security welled up in her heart.

Xu Qi’an’s mood, however, was the complete opposite. Sitting at the table, he opened the blue-covered book left by Fuxiang, and his mind was filled with only one thought:

_Shit!_

He finally knew what the latter part of this book was about.

The Sangpo case!

The Sangpo case involved the Yao race and their schemes. From Fuxiang’s perspective, he could see many more details and secrets that he had missed before.

And the Sangpo case was the one she had been deeply involved in.

_Tigers are the kings of the jungle. The sick tiger must represent Emperor Yuanjing._

_The fox tricking the small animals refers to Earl Pingyuan, who manipulated the trafficking organization and sold people._

*Earl Pingyuan, driven by ambition, colluded with the Liang Clique, orchestrated the murder of Princess Pingyang, and dealt a heavy blow to King Yu, forcing him out of the contest for Minister of War.*

*So, the noble white rabbit represents Princess Pingyang.*

“The tiger turned a blind eye and sheltered the fox… Emperor Yuanjing knew everything. He knew all along…” Xu Qi’an murmured.

“The wise monkey king represents Wei Yuan. Yes, it must be Wei Yuan.”

Xu Qi’an recalled a detail he had previously overlooked, something seemingly insignificant. When Earl Pingyuan died, Wei Yuan immediately ordered the Nightwatchers to capture the leaders of the trafficking organisation. The speed of his action was astonishing.

Back then, Xu Qi’an had marveled at Wei Yuan’s efficiency and the Nightwatchers' capabilities.

But in hindsight, Wei Yuan had been investigating Earl Pingyuan and the trafficking organisation for a long time.

_The tiger, fearing exposure, decided to silence everyone. So, it instructed the python to tell the black bear that the fox had eaten the bear’s cub._

_Henghui wasn’t the black bear, because Henghui was also a victim of Earl Pingyuan. He knew exactly who his enemy was, he didn’t need the python to tell him. And the black bear didn’t just kill the fox; he slaughtered its entire family._

_Then who killed the fox, Earl Pingyuan? It was Hengyuan. Hengyuan is the black bear. The black bear’s cub is Henghui. Hengyuan, in his search for Henghui, stormed Earl Pingyuan’s manor and killed him._

Xu Qi’an shuddered. He had uncovered another layer of the truth behind the Sangpo case—or rather, the murder of Princess Pingyang.

The Princess Pingyang case was a bargaining chip between the Yao race and the former Minister of Rites. And Fuxiang’s identity… that was why she could see the hidden truths.

Through her story, she had conveyed two key pieces of information:

First, Earl Pingyuan’s human trafficking operation was serving Emperor Yuanjing.

Second, Emperor Yuanjing was "sick" and had to "keep eating."

_Aside from the late Emperor’s daily records, I now have another lead on Emperor Yuanjing. But Earl Pingyuan is dead, and his entire household was wiped out. How can I pursue this lead?_

_Hengyuan?!_

Xu Qi’an's body tensed.

He rushed back to his bed, reached under his pillow for his Earth Book fragment, his movements hurried and causing noticeable noise. Zhong Li, startled once again, raised her head.

Xu Qi’an wrote:

【THREE: Master Hengyuan, I need to ask you something.】

There was no response. The Earth Book chat fell into silence.

Hengyuan didn’t reply.

Xu Qi’an’s face paled.
