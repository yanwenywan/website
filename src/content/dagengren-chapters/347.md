# 347. Analysing the Reason Why the Princess Consort has Come With Them

Since ancient times, port cities have thrived economically. Although the county city of Huangyou County was not large in scale, its streets were broad and straight, bustling with a ceaseless flow of people.

Xu Qi’an stood on the pier, surveying the scene. Porters and labourers moved back and forth, sweating profusely under the sun.

Sweeping his gaze across the area, he locked onto a foreman holding an account book, leisurely sipping tea under a shaded canopy. With a casual stride, Xu Qi’an approached, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade as he looked down at the man.

The foreman stared at Xu Qi’an, then at the Nightwatchers behind him, noting the silver and bronze gongs on their uniforms. While he might not recognize the uniforms of the Nightwatchers, their reputation was well-known even among common folk.

*A-… are these the legendary Nightwatchers?* the foreman thought, both awed and nervous. He quickly stood up, bowing ninety degrees: “Sirs, how may I assist you?”

As he spoke, he pulled out a handful of loose silver from his pocket and offered it with both hands.

Xu Qi’an ignored the gesture and cut straight to the point. “Are you the foreman here?”

The man nodded repeatedly, still bowing. “Yes sir.”

Xu Qi’an slowly nodded, casting his eyes toward the busy porters. “Have there been any refugees from the north recently?”

“Refugees?” The foreman paused, furrowing his brows in thought before shaking his head. “No, sir. But I’ve heard about it—the North is at war. The barbarians are burning, killing, and looting everywhere. Luckily, the Zhenbei King is holding the line. Without him, Chuzhou might have already fallen.”

“You hold the Zhenbei King in high regard?” Xu Qi’an asked, his tone devoid of any particular emotion.

“Of course!” The foreman’s face lit up with admiration. “The Zhenbei King is the Military God of the Great Feng, the greatest warrior of our time. It’s because of him that the North remains secure.”

*When did the Zhenbei King become the Military God? The true Military God of the Great Feng is Duke Wei…* Xu Qi’an thought to himself, leaving the foreman behind as he walked away with the Silver Gongs and Bronze Gongs in tow.

Under the shaded canopy, the foreman watched their retreating backs, muttering to himself, “They didn’t even take the silver? Are they out of their minds?”

After a couple hours of wandering the city, Xu Qi’an had visited a teahouse, a goulan, and even struck up conversations with beggars. His accompanying Nightwatchers began to sense that Xu Qi’an had ulterior motives on this outing.

The supposed trip to the goulan was clearly just a pretence.

“Sir Xu, what are you investigating?” one of the Silver Gongs finally asked.

“Refugees of course,” Xu Qi’an replied, standing by the street with one hand resting on his blade. His brows furrowed. “Something is odd. Haven’t you noticed?”

One of the more seasoned Silver Gongs pondered for a moment before replying, “No refugees? That’s not strange. We’ve only just arrived in Jiangzhou, and Chuzhou is still at least ten days away by water. If traveling by land, it would take no less than half a month. Refugees wouldn’t have made it this far yet.”

Xu Qi’an shook his head, giving the man a sidelong glance. “Have you forgotten what case we’re investigating?”

The four Silver Gongs stiffened, realization dawning on them as they understood Xu Qi’an’s point.

An atrocity like the “Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles” case would typically occur in a prolonged war involving large-scale troop deployments.

Such devastation would inevitably create waves of refugees. Even if Jiangzhou was far from Chuzhou, it was unlikely that none had managed to escape and reach here.

And yet, there were none...

*This case is more complicated than I anticipated…* Xu Qi’an’s heart sank, and he couldn’t help but feel a sense of heaviness. But as he glanced at his colleagues’ worried faces, he suddenly let out a light chuckle. In a tone exuding supreme confidence, he slowly said:

“Interesting. Now _this_ is a case worth investigating. Too simple, and it would be boring.”

Despite his short tenure, Sir Xu’s storied experiences far surpassed what most Nightwatchers would encounter in a lifetime. Recalling the many high-profile cases he had solved, the Nightwatchers felt their anxiety lessen, confidence returning.

Before lunch, Xu Qi’an returned to the official ship carrying a food box and several uncut pieces of butter jade.

After placing the jade in his room, he carried the food box to the third floor and stopped before a corner room, knocking lightly on the door.

“Who is it?”

The old auntie’s weak yet irritable voice came from within.

“It’s me,” Xu Qi’an replied with a grin.

Hearing his voice, there was no response from inside, nor was the door opened. It seemed the occupant planned to ignore him.

“Fu Wenpei, open the door! I know you’re in there. You’re bold enough to seduce men, but not bold enough to open the door?”

Xu Qi’an was a despicable person.

“Bang!”

The door flew open. Standing there was the old Auntie in her azure maidservant attire, her brows furrowed in anger. “What nonsense are you spouting?”

This rapscallion dared to accuse her of seducing men right outside her door! Outrageous! Even though she was just an ordinary maidservant now, a maidservant still had her reputation to protect.

*Not as if anyone else heard…* Xu Qi’an chuckled. “Why are you so worked up?”

Seeing her roll her eyes and attempt to shut the door, Xu Qi’an quickly said, “I brought you lunch.”

The Auntie sneered, “You’re not that kindhearted.”

“I noticed you looked unwell this morning. You must not have slept well last night and probably got seasick too. Since you likely missed breakfast, I brought you something to eat.”

Ignoring her protests, Xu Qi’an walked in, casually glancing around. The room was clean and tidy, clearly well-maintained.

Setting the food box on the table, he opened it and began laying out the dishes.

The Auntie peeked at the food, noticing unfamiliar dishes. Unable to hold back her curiosity, she asked, “What’s this one?”

“Glazed Lungs. Quite tasty, actually. It’s one of the signature dishes from the best restaurant in Huangyou County. I also got you some of their other specialties,” Xu Qi’an explained.

“I don’t want to eat.”

The Auntie’s tone was indifferent

She wasn’t feeling well and had no appetite. Besides, having been pampered in the prince’s manor for so many years, what delicacies hadn’t she tasted? The rare and luxurious foods that commoners could only dream of were mundane fare to her.

“But I’m sure you’ll like this dish.” Xu Qi’an placed a bowl of soup on the table.

The old maid glanced at it, her face immediately wrinkling with disdain. The soup was dark and unappealing. “What’s this fawning… what do you want? Just say it?”

*Just what I was waiting for…* Xu Qi’an sat down at the table, coughed lightly, and said, “The princess consort is here too, isn’t she?”

At the mention of "princess consort," her brows twitched slightly. She remained calm and nodded. “Mm.”

“Why is the princess consort in this delegation? And why was I, the lead official, unaware beforehand?” Xu Qi’an asked with a sly smile.

“Do you think I’d know?” the old maid retorted irritably, clearly unwilling to elaborate. She waved him off. “If there’s nothing else, leave. I’m going to rest.”

Xu Qi’an had no choice but to take his leave.

After the annoying scoundrel left, she closed the door. Planning to pack away the food, she suddenly caught a whiff of tangy aroma. It was an enticing mix of sour and spicy, pulling at her appetite like an invisible hand.

The scent came from the bowl of unappealing soup.

*It might not taste too bad…* She sat down, scooped up a spoonful, and took a small sip.

The sour and spicy flavour immediately awakened her taste buds, stirring her appetite. Her throat involuntarily swallowed, and she drank several more spoonfuls in quick succession.

When she finished the soup, she finally felt hungry. The rest of the dishes on the table, which had initially seemed unappealing, now appeared more tempting.

…

_Knock, knock._

There was a soft rapping at the door, followed by Chu Xianglong’s voice. “It’s me.”

“The door’s unlocked. Come in,” she replied coldly and indifferently.

Chu Xianglong pushed the door open and saw the princess consort seated at the table, eating with relish.

He frowned slightly and spoke through voice transmission: “What is your relationship with him? Just nod or shake your head.”

He knew the food had been delivered by Xu Qi’an earlier.

The princess consort shook her head.

Chu Xianglong’s gaze grew sharper. “No relationship, yet he brought you lunch?”

She shook her head again.

Chu Xianglong studied her for a moment, reluctantly accepting her answer. He lamented inwardly about her overwhelming charm, which seemed to draw men to approach and curry favor.

“Please remember your identity, Princess Consort. Avoid getting too close to irrelevant individuals,” he admonished via voice transmission before leaving the room without a sound.

Not a single noise was made during the entire exchange.

The ship housed not only Gold Gong Yang Yan but also other martial artists. With their sharp senses, the saying “walls have ears” couldn’t be more apt.

…

*Not knowing anything is also a kind of information. It confirms my suspicions—the Zhenbei King’s consort heading to the northern border isn’t as simple as it seems...*

*Her discreet travel arrangements, kept even from me as the lead official, and the unusually small number of guards make sense if they’re trying to stay low profile. Traveling with the diplomatic mission ensures both discretion and adequate protection.*

*But why go to such lengths?*

Xu Qi’an returned to his room, sat at his desk, and frowned in thought.

*Why would the princess consort’s journey to the north be shrouded in such secrecy? Is it because the title of ‘The Nation’s Most Beautiful Woman’ draws too much attention? That can’t be it. In the Great Feng, who would dare make a move on the Zhenbei King’s legitimate wife? Even someone as uninhibited and free-spirited as me has never entertained such thoughts.*

*Based on intent, this suggests that Yuanjing Emperor doesn’t want news of the princess consort leaving the capital to spread widely. But that doesn’t make sense. Why hide the travels of a mere princess consort visiting her husband?*

*Unless this princess consort isn’t as simple as she seems, and her journey involves some classified mission? If so, there are two likely reasons for her covert departure with the delegation: one, it pertains to some secret operation requiring confidentiality; or two, her journey carries inherent danger, necessitating the delegation’s protection.*

At this thought, Xu Qi’an’s pupils contracted slightly, his gaze turning sharp.
