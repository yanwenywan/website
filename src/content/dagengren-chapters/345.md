# 345. Draw blades

Chu Xianglong finished his lunch and ordered his attendant to brew a cup of tea. Cradling the steaming cup, he took a light sip and asked,

"How has the princess consort consort been lately?"

"She’s been staying in her room," the attendant replied.

The luxurious and spacious room where the princess consort consort supposedly resided was, in fact, a façade. The real princess consort would spend her days mingling among the maidservants, disguised as an ordinary maid.

Sometimes, she would sneak into the kitchen to snatch food or enthusiastically watch the sailors cast their nets, occasionally offering misguided instructions from the sidelines.

The sailors, rather than being annoyed, found themselves developing a fondness for the seemingly plain and older servant woman. A few unmarried sailors with some savings even started discreetly inquiring about her background.

Such was the princess consort’s charm. Even with her unremarkable appearance, prolonged interaction could still win over the hearts of men.

This was precisely why Chu Xianglong strictly forbade the soldiers from going on deck or interacting with the princess consort in private. However, he couldn’t openly express concern for a mere servant.

"We need to head north quickly. Once we reach Chuzhou and rendezvous with the troops sent by the Zhenbei King, we’ll be completely safe," Chu Xianglong said with a sigh.

Blending into the investigation team had been a wise choice. Before departure, even key officials like Xu Qi’an hadn’t known the princess consort was among them.

Suddenly, he heard a commotion of heavy footsteps coming from the deck, followed by the loud, hearty chatter of men.

*Have the soldiers below deck all come out...* Chu Xianglong’s face darkened, and anger surged within him. He had repeatedly ordered his subordinates to stay off the deck. Were his orders now being ignored?

He left his quarters, walked through the corridor, and stepped onto the deck. There, he saw groups of soldiers dumping waste from chamber pots into the river. The wind carried the stench back toward him, making him wrinkle his nose.

Standing amidst them was Centurion Chen Xiao, barking orders: "Make sure to clean those pots thoroughly after emptying them!"

"Got it!"

The soldiers responded enthusiastically, grinning as they worked.

Chu Xianglong stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression grim as he barked, "Who told you to come up here?"

The noise abruptly ceased. The soldiers hastily set down their chamber pots, exchanged uneasy glances, and lowered their heads, not daring to speak.

Chu Xianglong scolded, "Do you think numbers will save you from punishment? Since you’re so eager to come up here, men, fetch the military rods, flog them."

Moments later, the sound of hurried footsteps approached. Chu Xianglong’s guards appeared from the opposite side of the deck, carrying rods in hand.

"General Chu, this… this..."

Chen Xiao panicked. He hadn’t immediately explained the situation because it would seem as though he was stoking conflict between two senior officials. Moreover, Xu Qi’an had just returned to his quarters. If he truly intended to advocate for the soldiers, he would step forward.

If not, it would mean he preferred to avoid clashing with Chu Xianglong—a deputy general under the Zhenbei King, a man with real power and influence.

"General Chu, why the anger? I ordered them to clean the chamber pots."

Finally, the voice the soldiers had been waiting for emerged from below deck. Xu Qi’an, dressed in his Silver Gong attire and with one hand resting on his sabre, strode out confidently.

Chu Xianglong turned to face him, his tone sharp and overbearing:

"Did you not know of my orders? If you didn’t, then ensure they never come up again. If you did, then I demand an explanation."

Chen Xiao, bracing himself, saluted and said, "General Chu, it’s like this: some soldiers fell ill, and I was at a loss, so I sought help from Sir Xu..."

*He’s either extremely loyal or very shrewd...* Xu Qi’an thought. Aloud, he snapped, "Is it your place to speak? Stand down."

Chen Xiao lowered his head and stepped back, gratitude flickering in his eyes.

Silver Gong Xu was shielding him from the heat.

After reprimanding the centurion, Xu Qi’an turned to Chu Xianglong and said coldly:

“You want an explanation, General Chu? Why don’t you go below deck yourself? Better yet, spend a few days down there for a more thorough understanding.

"I’ve decided: from now on, the imperial guard below deck may come up during the following times—between six and eight in the morning, twelve to two at lunch, and four to six in the afternoon."

Three intervals, for a total of six hours.

This measure would greatly improve ventilation and benefit the soldiers’ well-being.

The soldiers on deck exchanged delighted glances, their spirits lifted. The sweltering, foul-smelling conditions below deck had been unbearable, especially when they had to eat their dry rations there.

Physical discomfort was one thing; the psychological toll was worse.

Chu Xianglong’s tone was laced with disdain as he countered, "Sir Xu, if you don’t know how to lead troops, then refrain from meddling. Is this minor hardship worth fretting over? On the battlefield, you’d eat mud and sleep amidst corpses."

Chu Xianglong replied lightly: “Sir Xu, you’re inexperienced at leading soldiers, so kindly do not wantonly intervene. What is this little hardship? On the battlefield, you’ll even need to eat mud, and like amongst corpses.”

His words were accompanied by a mocking smirk, not hiding one bit his disdain and contempt.

Xu Qi’an stepped forward, meeting Chu Xianglong’s gaze head-on, and retorted: “General Chu is a veteran of the battlefield, I certainly cannot command better than you. But if you want to argue logic with me, we can talk about it.

“You talk about war. Can extraordinary times be the same as ordinary ones? Are General Chu’s troops also living daily in the toilets, eating their dry rations over shit and piss?

“These are elite troops, they endure gruelling training and know how to fight. But hardship and suffering are not the same. One raises troops for a thousand days, only to use them in an instant. If you don’t know how to care for your troops, then how can you command them? How can you do battle?

“To put it plainly, they’re not your troops. That’s why you don’t treat them like people.”

*Well said!*

Chen Xiao roared inwardly. Over the past few days, he'd watched his soldiers grow more listless, and his heart ached deeply for them—after all, they were his men.

Chu Xianglong didn’t treat them like human beings, all because they weren’t under his command.

*"Raise troops for a thousand days to use them in an instant." Silver Gong Xu is truly worthy of being Great Feng’s Laureate of Poetry...* Chen Xiao felt genuine admiration. The more he reflected, the more he realized the profound truth in those words.

The soldiers, heads lowered and teeth clenched, remained silent. Yet their tightly clenched fists revealed the indignation brewing within.

Though they were at the lowest ranks and indeed had little status, soldiers were human beings, too. They had emotions.

Chu Xianglong seemed to be enraged, his expression both defiant and fierce. He strode forward, closing the distance until his face was inches from Xu Qi’an's, and demanded harshly, “Are you teaching me how to do my job? Just who do you think you are?”

“I was wondering, did I back down too quickly last time, letting you get your way so easily? So much so that it gave you the wrong impression?”

Xu Qi’an stepped back a step, increasing the distance between him and Chu Xianglong.

In Chu Xianglong’s eyes, this retreat was a sign of cowardice. Indeed, his first impression of Xu Qi’an was that he was an extraordinarily talented individual who coveted power. Such a person could be easily controlled or suppressed with greater authority.

This impression was based on Xu Qi’an’s behaviour during the imperial examination scandal: easily handing over the Vajra Divine Art without resistance, even delivering the Buddhist artefact to Chu Xianglong’s door afterward.

Many martial artists were willing to grovel despite their strength, bowing and scraping before high-ranking officials due to their lust for power.

“Isn’t that the case?” Chu Xianglong sneered disdainfully.

The words had barely left his lips when Xu Qi’an, who had taken a step back, suddenly pivoted. Without any warning, his leg whipped out in a vicious roundhouse kick aimed squarely at Chu Xianglong’s waist.

The strike came without the slightest hesitation.

Chu Xianglong crossed his arms to block, but with a loud bang, a ripple of energy exploded outward. It was as if he’d been struck by a battering ram. His legs slid back, and his body slammed hard into the cabin wall, cracking the sturdy wood.

A glint of golden light emerged between Xu Qi’an's brows, rapidly spreading across his entire body to reveal a radiant golden form. He enunciated, one word at a time: “My temper is very short, shitstain.”

Wei Yuan had advised him to maintain good relations with the  Zhenbei King's men to avoid unnecessary obstacles during the investigation. However, Wei Yuan definitely hadn’t intended for him to grovel or smile subserviently, offering the other cheek after being slapped on one.

After all, if the case led nowhere, Xu Qi’an, as the court-appointed lead investigator, could simply return to the capital unscathed. On the other hand, if evidence detrimental to Zhenbei King were uncovered, even a sworn brotherhood with Chu Xianglong would be futile.

Xu Qi’an had long been disgusted with Chu Xianglong—ever since he’d taken advantage of his brother’s predicament to seize the Vajra Divine Art.

Chu Xianglong’s arms ached, and the shock of the blow agitated his old injuries. Staring at Xu Qi’an in disbelief, he thought, _He actually dares to attack?_

Did Xu Qi’an, a mere Silver Gong, really think he could afford to offend a high-ranking commander, a deputy to Zhenbei King who wielded genuine authority?

“General!”

Chu Xianglong’s guards roared in outrage, swarming forward with their flogging rods raised, ready to subdue the insolent Silver Gong.

“Sir Xu!”

At the same time, a hundred Imperial Guards surged forward, rallying around Xu Qi’an. Their expressions were cold and resolute as they faced off against Chu Xianglong’s men.

The Imperial Guards’ stance was unequivocal. While they and the Silver Gong belonged to different offices and didn’t usually interfere with one another, Xu Qi’an was the lead investigator and the mission’s highest authority. More importantly, his earlier words had earned their respect, making him someone they were willing to risk their lives for.

“Stand down, all of you!”

A commanding shout rang out as several officials arrived in haste from the cabins below.

The newcomers included two censors from the Censorate, the chief constable of the Ministry of Law, and a deputy justice from the High Court, each flanked by their respective guards and officers.

The two censors rushed to mediate, their voices overlapping in a flurry of placating words. “Let’s talk this over, both of you! There’s no need for violence!”

The High Court’s deputy justice glanced at the cracked wall and the glowing golden body of Xu Qi’an. With a sarcastic tone, he said, “Sir Xu, such impressive martial skills. It seems none of us aboard this ship could match you.”

“You’ve come at the right time,” Chu Xianglong growled. He shot Xu Qi’an a venomous glare before recounting the events to the officials. Pointing an accusing finger, he said, “The soldiers were just a pretext. His true intention was to retaliate against me. How do you suggest we handle this?”

The deputy justice immediately declared, “There are women aboard. It is inappropriate for soldiers to loiter on the deck. General Chu’s orders were entirely reasonable.”

The chief constable of the Ministry of Law added indifferently, “I believe Sir Xu should offer an apology, and the Imperial Guards should return to the hold and refrain from coming up again. Let’s put this matter to rest. Our journey north requires unity.”

The two censors nodded in agreement.

Their stance was straightforward: they disliked Xu Qi’an, who had prior conflicts with all three judicial bodies. Additionally, maintaining good relations with Zhenbei King’s general was strategically beneficial for their mission.

Meanwhile, the commotion on the deck had reached the ears of the princess consort, who had been sipping tea in her cabin. She stepped out to find a group of palace maids gathered in the hallway leading to the deck.

“What’s going on?” she asked habitually, frowning.

The maids glanced at her, their expressions betraying some annoyance at the unfamiliar old servant’s presumptuous tone. Chattering amongst themselves, they replied:

“General Chu and Silver Gong Xu had a conflict—nearly came to blows!”

“It seems General Chu forbade the guards in the hold from coming onto the deck, but Silver Gong Xu disagreed, and that’s how it all started.”

“Hmph, that Silver Gong Xu doesn’t know his place. How dare he clash with General Chu, deputy to our King Huai? Now all the officials are siding with General Chu and demanding him apologise.”

“I admire Silver Gong Xu, but this time he’s in the wrong. Those big, smelly soldiers are such an eyesore. Now we can’t even go to the deck to enjoy the breeze!”

The princess consort tried to push her way past the maids, but the girls who usually treated her with utmost respect did not yield. Instead, they reasonably blocked her way, forcing her back.

The princess consort fumed internally, unable to catch a glimpse of what was happening on the deck. Fortunately, the maids quieted down, allowing her to hear Xu Qi’an’s cold laugh:

“Apologise? I’m the emperor’s personally appointed lead official. On this ship, **I** have the final say.”

The High Court deputy justice countered, “It’s true that you’re the lead official, but that doesn’t mean you dictate everything in the delegation. Otherwise, what’s the point of our presence?”

The Ministry of Law’s lead constable nodded. “His Majesty’s decree is for the Three Divisions and the Nightwatchers to collaborate in this investigation. If Sir Xu intends to monopolise authority, then this official, for one, cannot agree.”

The two censors from the Censorate concurred with the constable and the High Court minister.

In an instant, all the pressure shifted onto Xu Qi’an.

Even if he stubbornly refused to apologise, his credibility would suffer if he was publicly isolated and rejected by his colleagues. It would shatter his authority; no one in the delegation would take him seriously anymore. They might maintain a veneer of respect but would secretly look down on him.

The princess consort quickly grasped the officials’ intentions.

She didn’t believe this man, renowned for his bold manoeuvres in the Buddhist contest, would back down. But in the current situation, whether or not he conceded no longer mattered.

Everyone could see that Silver Gong Xu, the lead official, was unpopular among his peers. He was being sidelined and suppressed.

Once this perception solidified, his authority as lead official would crumble. No one would truly follow him. Even if they obeyed outwardly, they’d scorn him inwardly.

*If it were King Huai, he’d never face such a predicament. I’ve certainly never seen him in a similar bind,* the princess consort thought.

For reasons she couldn’t explain, she kept subconsciously comparing King Huai to the young man on the deck.

Upon reflection, though, she realized the two couldn’t be equated. After all, King Huai was a noble and a third rank martial artist, far beyond Xu Ningyan’s league.

Still, she found herself wondering: *What will he do now?*

*Surely, he won’t back down... If he does, I’ll look down on him… But if he does apologise, I’ll have plenty of ammunition to mock him…*

While her thoughts raced, she suddenly heard Xu Qi’an shout:

“Soldiers, hear my command! As lead official, appointed by imperial decree to investigate this case of utmost importance, I hereby order the expulsion of idle and disruptive individuals. Chu Xianglong and his subordinates are to vacate the vessel!”

Immediately, only four Silver Gongs and eight Bronze Gongs drew their weapons to support Xu Qi’an.

The hundred imperial guards on the deck remained silent, seemingly unwilling to get involved.

The scene fell into a brief silence. Then, one soldier quietly retreated below deck.

Then another, and another... Soon, more and more soldiers, heads lowered, began leaving the deck and returning to their quarters.

In no time, the deck was cleared.

“Tch!”

Chu Xianglong’s derisive sneer rang out, particularly grating in the quiet.

The High Court deputy justice wore a face of ridicule, clearly savouring Xu Qi’an’s plight.

The Ministry of Law’s constable leaned casually against a wall, arms crossed, a smirk playing at his lips as he prepared to watch the show unfold.

The two censors from the Censorate shook their heads in exasperation.

Suddenly, the sound of chaotic footsteps echoed from the stairwell, thump, thump, thump, growing louder with each step.

The hundred imperial guards returned—but this time, the chamber pots in their hands had been replaced with military-issue sabres.

They had gone below deck to arm themselves.

Chen Xiao gripped the hilt of his saber as he strode to Xu Qi’an’s side. In a deep voice, he commanded, “Draw blades!”

*Sching...*

The synchronized sound of blades being unsheathed filled the air. The hundred soldiers brandished their sabres, pointing them squarely at Chu Xianglong and his men.

“Are- are you trying to mutiny?!” the High Court deputy justice bellowed, his face changing as anger and fear intertwined.

Chen Xiao stayed silent, licking his lips as his sharp gaze locked onto the High Court official. Then he glanced at Xu Qi’an, as if awaiting the lead official’s order to strike down the talkative bureaucrat.

The High Court deputy justice shivered, instinctively retreating several steps. He dared not speak again.

The Ministry of Law’s constable, who had been watching with amusement, straightened his posture. His expression shifted from playful to grim as he tightened his grip on his saber, readying himself for the worst.

As a martial artist, he recognized the unyielding resolve in the imperial guards’ eyes. When they wielded their blades, there was never hesitation.

The veins on Chu Xianglong’s forehead bulged as he clenched his jaw. He still couldn’t believe that, as the Zhenbei King’s deputy general, he was being subjected to such treatment. These lowly soldiers dared to draw their blades against him.

“Yang Yan!” Chu Xianglong roared. “Are the Nightwatchers planning a rebellion? I am traveling with the delegation under imperial orders!”

“Enough noise,” Yang Yan’s icy voice drifted from the cabin. “I do not know about this matter.”

“You—”

Chu Xianglong’s face turned pale. His expression twisted through several shades before he fixed his furious gaze on Xu Qi’an, grinding out the words, “What do you want?”

Standing tall in the sunlight, Xu Qi’an’s face radiated defiance. He declared, “Three things:

“First, my previous decision stands. The soldiers will have six hours of daily free time.

“Second, remember who I am. In this delegation, your words carry no weight.

“Any objections?”

Chu Xianglong’s face darkened as he slowly nodded.

Xu Qi’an stepped closer, his blade in hand, a cold smile on his lips. “Third, apologise to me.”

For a moment, Chu Xianglong’s face contorted, the veins on his forehead bulging, his facial muscles twitching.

But in the end, he yielded, his voice low and strained. “Sir… Sir Xu, please be magnanimous, forgive my impropriety.”

Xu Qi’an sneered. “Excellent.”

Behind him, the hundred imperial guards grinned broadly, their smiles simple and unreserved.
