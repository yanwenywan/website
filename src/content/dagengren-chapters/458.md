# 458. Reverse Social Death

Late at night, in the northern frontier, the desolation was laced with a bone-piercing chill.

Lying on his side by the campfire and dozing, Xu Xinnian would wake at intervals, place both hands on the shoulders of two soldiers, and softly chant, “Hot blood coursing!”

The two soldiers let out a contented murmur, no longer curling up for warmth as they had before, and showed faint signs of satisfaction in their sleep.

The yao, barbarians and the Great Feng coalition had been scattered by the heavy cavalry of Jing, leaving many supplies behind, such as rations and daily necessities.

With no tents, no bedding or mattresses, camping out in the northern frontier as autumn set in was a bitter ordeal. The soldiers could easily catch cold and fall ill.

And without adequate resources, falling ill was a death sentence.

So, in the dead of night, Xu Erlang would wake regularly to cast warming spells on the soldiers.

He was now an seventh-rank Benevolent. At this level, a Confucian not only possessed a body hardier than most, but had also grasped the rudiments of “Laws Follow Commandments.”

Speech was power!

Xu Erlang could, within a reasonable scope, apply any status effect to a target, weakness, courage, pain relief…

The key term here being “reasonable”; it still had to be plausible.

To be specific, his current level allowed him only to help soldiers tap into their potential and ward off the cold. If Dean Zhao Shou were here instead, he’d belt out a line like, “Such beauty the desert shows in March\~\~”

And the surrounding weather would shift from autumn to spring, staying that way for quite some time.

After applying the warming spell to each soldier, Xu Erlang looked visibly exhausted. He fished out a piece of jerkey from his robes and tore into it.

It was only then that he noticed Chu Yuanzhen hadn’t gone to sleep. The former top scholar sat leaning against a cart, his feet sunk into the earth, having dug deep pits.

*His expression is off. Tch, a grown man with such a complex look on his face…* Xu Erlang got up, walked over, and sat beside him.

“What’s the matter? You’ve looked off ever since that transmission.”

“I just feel like… the trust between people, gone, just like that…”

With an expression like the world had collapsed, Chu Yuanzhen stared at Xu Xinjian, struggling to speak before finally muttering, “Erlang, I’ve said some strange things to you before. Done some strange things. I hope you won’t take it to heart. Thinking back on it now gives me goosebumps. I feel like I’ve ruined my spotless reputation.”

Xu Erlang thought for a moment. “You mean, standing by the roadside and inexplicably grinning at me?”

Chu Yuanzhen looked like he’d been struck by lightning. “Don’t, don’t say it…”

The truth was obvious. Number Three was Xu Qi’an. He had been impersonating his cousin Xu Xinnian all along. Number Three had said he didn’t want his identity exposed, so when they met in person, best not to mention the Earth Book.

Number Three had also said he was about to head out on a campaign, and that the Earth Book fragment would be left in his elder brother’s care for now.

All of it was smoke and mirrors meant to conceal the truth that Xu Ningyan was Number Three.

But, but Xu Erlang had played along so well.

Unwilling to let it go, Chu Yuanzhen asked, “You said you didn’t know about the Earth Book fragment. But I always felt you were especially, um, tolerant of me. No matter what strange things I said or did, you never reacted.”

Many of their exchanges, which at the time had seemed full of unspoken understanding, now looked utterly one-sided. Xu Erlang hadn’t known about the Earth Book fragment at all, there was no tacit agreement.

Xu Xinnian replied frankly, “Big Brother instructed me that no matter what strange things you said or did, I should act like it was normal, either smile, nod, or ignore it.”

Chu Yuanzhen’s feet dug into the dirt again.

But quickly, his agile mind came up with a twist. Xu Ningyan had been impersonating his cousin for so long, he had to maintain the persona. That meant he was constantly boasting about “Big Brother” in the book fragment, saying all kinds of hair-raising things.

Now that he knew Xu Ningyan’s true identity, the one who should be embarrassed was Xu Ningyan!

He couldn’t let this go.

A smile broke across Chu Yuanzhen’s face. The thought was liberating.

…

The Capital, Xu Manor.

Xu Qi’an felt as though something had slapped his head, snapping him awake. He’d had a few similar experiences, so he didn’t suspect the Taiping Sabre or Zhong Li for knocking his skull.

*Damn it, a private message in the dead of night, don’t tell me it’s that boring old Huaiqing again…* He deftly pulled the Earth Book fragment from under his pillow, got up, walked over to the desk, and lit a candle.

In the warm glow, he sat down and checked the message.

【FOUR: Xu Qi’an, you’re Number Three, aren’t you? You’ve been lying to us all along.】

Xu Qi’an froze.

*When did Chu Yuanzhen find out?*

*When was I exposed?*

*Did he finally see through my act because of something Erlang let slip?*

In that moment, shame crashed over him like a tidal wave, no, a tsunami, swallowing him whole.

After that one message, Chu Yuanzhen went silent, while Xu Qi’an sank into a pit of humiliation, unable to summon the “courage” to reply.

After a long while, he finally composed himself and replied:

【THREE: Not bad. You’re the first in the Heaven and Earth Society, aside from Daoist Jinlian, to uncover my identity.】

*No matter how shameful and awkward reality might be, online, I’m still composed. I’m still a heavy-hitter.*

The key was to maintain a breezy attitude to defuse the awkwardness.

【FOUR: Heh, you kept the secret well. I’ve suspected for a while, but only confirmed it recently.】

【THREE: As expected of the zhuangyuan.】

One of them wanted nothing more than to fly his sword back to the capital and slice Xu Qi’an in half. The other wanted to cover his face and die of shame.

Yet both made sure to act like it didn’t bother them.

【THREE: Recently?】

【FOUR: Heh. Four hours ago, after I asked you about your second uncle’s old comrade, Erlang confessed everything.】

*What the hell, Erlang! So unreliable. Wait, what about my second uncle’s comrade…* Xu Qi’an frowned and asked:

【THREE: My second uncle’s comrade?】

*So this guy wasn’t totally indifferent either. Just putting on a show…* Chu Yuanzhen then retold the story of Zhou Biao and Zhao Panyi.

Clatter!

The sound of a chair tipping over woke Zhong Li. She rubbed her eyes and looked up.

She saw Xu Qi’an rush madly to the desk, grind ink, grab a brush, and write like a man possessed…

About fifteen minutes later, she watched him dry the ink, fold the paper, and tuck it carefully into a book. He exhaled and muttered:

“So that’s how obscuring Heaven’s secrets works.”

“How does what works?” Zhong Li perked up and asked in a small voice.

“Don’t ask. It’s a secret,” Xu Qi’an snapped, then added, “You’re a professional and you’re asking an amateur like me?”

Zhong Li lowered her head in shame and curled up in her blanket, seeking what little warmth remained in the world.

Xu Qi’an let out a breath, calmed himself, and sent a message:

【THREE: Brother Chu, could you keep this matter secret for me?】

【FOUR: Your identity isn’t a secret. No need to hide it.】

Xu Qi’an could almost see Chu Yuanzhen’s mocking, cold smile from the far-off northern frontier.

【THREE: Very well. If it must be made public, I’d rather be the one to confess. What I did was indeed improper. It led you to mistake Erlang for Number Three and trust him completely. You said and did a lot of the wrong things.】

【FOUR: To be honest, I don’t really care whether your identity is exposed or not.】

*You damn Xu Qi’an. Just wait till I return to the capital, I’ll cleave your golden body in two…*

After a pause, Chu Yuanzhen sent another message: 【Xu Erlang knows about the Earth Book, and also knows that Hengyuan and I were deceived by you back then, which has caused him considerable distress.】

……Xu Qi’an cautiously replied: 【So?】

*I feel so ashamed I can’t lift my head... I need something to balance the relationship between Erlang and I...* Chu Yuanzhen wrote: 【I feel guilty.】

【THREE: Understood. Chat to Erlang about poetry when you can. His most famous line is: "If Heaven birthed not I, Xu Xinnian, the Great Feng would be a night that never ends."】

【FOUR: Mm.】

Having soothed the zhuangyuan, Xu Qi’an returned to bed, stuffed the Earth Book fragment into his pillow, then twisted about like a worm.

He was venting a tidal wave of shame.

*I’ve never been this embarrassed in my life... It’s too humiliating. My image and dignity are completely gone... Now, apart from Hengyuan, everyone knows what happened to me... Huh? Wait, everyone knows, but no one’s talking. Doesn’t that mean I haven’t suffered social death?*

*Even if everyone knows, if they’re all keeping it secret, even trying to make others believe Xu Cijiu is Number Three...*

*In that case, it’s as if I haven’t socially died.*

*On the contrary, if one day we all come clean, since it’s already common knowledge, I won’t even have anyone left to be embarrassed in front of. It’ll be those who’ve been covering for me, misleading others, who will really socially die.*

Xu Qi’an’s eyes lit up.

Relieved, he thought, *Right, I should sleep early. Tomorrow I explore the dragon ley with my little aunt.*

The next day.

After washing and finishing breakfast, Xu Qi’an sat in his room waiting. Before long, golden light pierced the roof without damaging it, and within the brilliant radiance, Luo Yuheng’s tall, graceful figure appeared.

She was still wearing the Daoist robe he’d seen last time, which cinched her waist and emphasised the curve of her chest.

It undoubtedly enhanced her feminine charm, made her presence as a woman more palpable, and softened the aloof aura of an untouchable immortal.

“National Teacher!”

Xu Qi’an greeted her warmly.

Luo Yuheng gave a slight nod and coolly replied, “Mhm. I’ll take you there.”

Though he had full confidence in Luo Yuheng, he cautiously asked, “Will they notice?”

“No.”

Her tone was calm. Her exquisitely sculpted face showed no emotion. “I’ll mask our qi.”

*Every cultivation path but the martial one is flashy... I’m jealous...* Xu Qi’an smiled. “No time to waste. Let’s go.”

Luo Yuheng nodded, swept her sleeve, and golden light enveloped Xu Qi’an, carrying him away from the room.

With a blink, Xu Qi’an saw the rock formations in the rear garden of Earl Pingyuan’s estate. Luo Yuheng’s soft, textured voice sounded in his ear: “Is it here?”

He hummed a response and stepped to one of the rocks, expertly triggering the mechanism.

The surface of the rock opened into a “door,” revealing a dark entrance.

“National Teacher, this is the tunnel,” Xu Qi’an said.

Luo Yuheng nodded reservedly and followed him in.

Soon, they reached the stone chamber and saw the large stone disc carved with twisted, bizarre script.

Luo Yuheng stood by the disc, studying it intently. “This is a high-level earth-travelling technique. It does seem like Senior Brother Jinlian’s handiwork.”

“Senior Brother Jinlian?”

Xu Qi’an expressed his confusion.

From what he’d learned in the late emperor’s diaries, Daoist Jinlian was a contemporary of the previous Human Sect leader. In Jianzhou, the lascivious Black Lotus’s clone had even called Luo Yuheng “good niece” and tried to dual cultivate with her.

The tall and beautiful National Teacher casually explained, “The leaders of the three sects are equals.”

*In terms of position, the three sect leaders were equal, so Jinlian is her senior brother. But in terms of age, Jinlian is of her father’s generation, so... also her sect uncle?*

Xu Qi’an had a sudden understanding. Meanwhile, his hands didn’t pause, he took out the Earth Book fragment and placed it on the disc.

…

Huaiqing Manor, in the study.

With her hair piled high and a few strands hanging loose, Huaiqing looked a little languid as she sat on a soft chair before a desk made of rare purple rhinoceros sandalwood from the Great Zhou dynasty.

A sheet of paper lay on the desk, and an ink-dipped wild rabbit hair brush rested quietly on a jade brush rack. She gazed at the paper, lost in thought.

After a full quarter of an hour of silence, Huaiqing finally picked up the brush and wrote: “26th Year of Zhende,” “corruption,” “Earth Sect Leader’s descent into madness,” “Chuzhou massacre,” “Soul Pill,” and other words.

Assuming the leader of the Earth Sect was the true culprit, Xu Qi’an’s hypothesis was reasonable and well-supported.

Many discovered clues aligned with it. Although some parts didn’t yet add up, that was because the full truth hadn’t come to light.

Hence some inconsistencies remained, such as the purpose behind the Earth Sect Leader corrupting the late emperor and the King of Huai.

*Father wanted to kill Hengyuan because Hengyuan discovered the secret passage under Earl Pingyuan’s estate. That means he knew of the Earth Sect Leader’s presence. Since the Chuzhou massacre, he’s been working to help that man. But why?*

This was the part Huaiqing found most illogical. From her perspective, if there was no benefit, no alliance could hold.

*Unless Father was completely controlled by the Earth Sect Leader... The court’s complex interests and relationships, could Daoist Jinlian really grasp them all?*

*The event that exposed the collaboration between Father, King Huai, and the Earth Sect Leader was the Chuzhou massacre. That proves it was key to them. And that case ultimately comes down to the Blood Pill and the Soul Pill.*

*The Soul Pill is critical...*

Time passed quietly. Who knew how long had gone by, when Huaiqing’s delicate ears twitched slightly, catching the sound of footsteps approaching the study.

She quickly crumpled the paper, held it in her hand, and tucked it into her sleeve.

After a few seconds, the footsteps stopped at the door. A palace maid’s soft voice came through: “Your Highness, Miss Caiwei is here.”

Huaiqing coolly replied, “Let her in.”

The maid stepped back, and Chu Caiwei bounced in, holding an orange in each hand, and chirped, “Huaiqing, I want to eat osmanthus fish.”

The chef in Huaiqing’s residence was famous for that dish, it couldn’t be found anywhere else.

Huaiqing smiled. “Alright, I’ll have the kitchen informed.”

Pleased, Chu Caiwei rummaged through her deerskin pouch and pulled out a big bag of pastries to share.

They ate pastries, sipped tea, and chatted idly. Then, in a natural tone, Huaiqing asked, “Caiwei, do you know about the Soul Pill?”

“Eh? Why is everyone asking about that lately?”

Chu Caiwei looked at her friend in surprise. “Xu Qi’an came to the Stargazing Tower a while back asking about it too. Of course I didn’t know, so I took him to the archives.”

“What’s the Soul Pill for?” Huaiqing asked earnestly.

Chu Caiwei showed an “aren’t you lucky” expression and said smugly, “I didn’t know before, but I happened to learn when I was reading with Xu Qi’an.”

She continued, “The Soul Pill is great stuff. Very versatile. It strengthens the spirit, serves as alchemy material, can be used to craft artefacts, repair damaged souls, and nurture spirit artefacts.”

*Repair damaged souls...* Huaiqing’s breath caught. Her hand slipped, knocking over her teacup.
