# 361. All Lies

At first, Xu Qi’an paid no attention, half his mind immersed in his own thoughts, the other half observing his surroundings.

Gradually, he noticed that the three men at the neighboring table were not ordinary.

First, their robust physiques were markedly different from the average person. While they could hide their qi, a warrior’s build was impossible to disguise.

Second, their gazes were purposeful, fixed solely in the direction of Sanhuang County while disregarding everything else, as though waiting for something.

Finally, there were traces of disguise on their faces.

*A jianghu vendetta?* Xu Qi’an mused. These three men had the same idea as him, lying in wait on the official road outside the city.

Their target would undoubtedly pass this way.

*Which is why they say the Jianghu is dangerous—either you strike first, or you get struck down. None of those ruffians have a good end...* Xu Qi’an, who had been a policeman in his previous life, sighed inwardly but did not dwell on it.

This world had its own rules. For instance, matters of the jianghu were resolved within the jianghu, born to the jianghu, die in the jianghu. The authorities typically turned a blind eye to their deaths as long as they did not harm civilians or disrupt public order.

"Give me a tael of silver..." the princess consort said softly.

"No, ten copper coins will do," she corrected herself.

Xu Qi’an glanced at her, then placed the coins on the table one by one, like Kong Yiji laying out coppers.

The princess consort quickly snatched them up with her petite hand, furtively glanced around, then glared at him and snapped, "Don’t flaunt your wealth!"

She tucked the coins into the belt at her waist.

Xu Qi’an chuckled. Under his influence, the princess consort had started learning and absorbing the ways of the jianghu. She was an eager learner but akin to a caged songbird, utterly unfamiliar with the struggles of commoners and society’s realities.

Naturally, her attempts often resulted in failure.

It was just ten copper coins—not enough to tempt anyone.

The princess consort pocketed the coins, requested two bowls and a pot of tea from the shopkeeper, and carefully cradled them along with her bundle as she left the shade of the pavilion.

She walked along the roadside and soon stopped in front of two beggars: an old beggar and a young one.

Xu Qi’an’s eyes followed the greatest beauty of the Great Feng Dynasty as she squatted before the beggars, setting the bowls down and pouring tea for them.

Then, the plain-looking princess consort divided her rations—the high-quality pastries Xu Qi’an had generously purchased—between the old beggar and the young one.

After watching them devour the food, she glanced around nervously and furtively handed the old beggar ten copper coins from her belt, as though terrified of being caught.

Xu Qi’an calmly observed, his pupils slightly unfocused.

After a while, the princess consort returned, holding the teapot and bowls, her steps light.

"In that case, I owe you a tael of silver... and ten copper coins," she said, unaware that one tael of silver equaled a hundred copper coins.

*Is this necessary? I’ve covered all your expenses along the way...* Xu Qi’an nodded, unusually refraining from teasing her. Instead, he asked, "What did you say to them?"

"They escaped from the border. Their village was massacred by the barbarians. The old beggar lost his family and fled with his grandson to this place," the princess consort replied, her brows furrowing.

Xu Qi’an made a sound of acknowledgment and fell silent for a moment before quipping, "You look beautiful today."

The princess consort scoffed, tilting her chin up proudly.

*Nonsense. Was there a woman in this world more beautiful than her?*

Suddenly, she frowned, cupping her face and rubbing it vigorously. With a distressed look, she complained, "Even like this, you’ll still be captivated by my beauty."

"..."

At that moment, the urgent clatter of hooves echoed. A group of riders came from the direction of Sanhuang County, led by someone cloaked in black and hooded, their face concealed behind a mask that revealed only their chin and lips.

The masked figure was a spy of the Zhenbei King, the very one who had crossed paths with Xu Qi’an on the street earlier that morning.

*Oh? I thought we’d have to wait by the roadside for days...* Xu Qi’an was pleased and excited. Recalling their earlier encounter, he restrained his hostility to avoid triggering the spy’s warrior instincts.

This spot, close to Sanhuang County, was bustling with travelers, making it unsuitable for a confrontation.

The riders passed the pavilion and quickly disappeared into the distance.

Just as Xu Qi’an was about to follow with the princess consort, the three men at the neighboring table sprang into action. They tossed a shard of silver onto the table, grabbed their weapons wrapped in cloth, and sprinted after the riders.

*They’re after the Zhenbei King’s spy too?*

Xu Qi’an sipped his tea without betraying any emotion.

After about half a stick of incense’s time, he rose and said, "Let’s go. I’ll show you something interesting."

The princess consort immediately got up, supporting herself on the table. She swayed her hips as she followed behind him.

Despite her simple attire and wooden hairpin, her voluptuous figure still turned heads in the pavilion. Many men inwardly remarked, *damn! what a fine ass!*

After walking a few steps, Xu Qi’an stopped and looked back at her. "I’ll carry you."

Walking there at her pace, the show would be over before they arrived.

The princess consort instinctively shook her head. Any intimate contact with a man was something she vehemently refused.

"No way?"

"No way!"

Xu Qi’an was always a gentleman who respected women, so he grabbed the back of the princess consort’s collar and launched into a sprint.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!* The sound of his footsteps was like rolling thunder. Each stride carried him dozens of yards, leaving deep imprints on the main road.

“St-stop… owwww…” The princess consort endured pressures far beyond her current level of cultivation.

Xu Qi’an glanced at her. The strong wind distorted her delicate features into a comical grimace, with tears streaming from her eyes. Witnessing such an unflattering state of the Great Feng’s most beautiful woman amused him greatly.

*Too bad the conservative clothing of this era didn’t allow for wardrobe malfunctions like those of scantily clad heroines in bawdy novels,* he thought.

After fifteen minutes, Xu Qi’an suddenly halted and released her collar.

Thud! The princess consort collapsed onto the ground, her face pale and her pupils unfocused, still dazed from the speed and adrenaline.

“Bastard!”

She looked ready to cry, clawing and biting as she pounced at Xu Qi’an to settle the score.

The pitiful princess consort, always so polished and dignified, had never faced such humiliation or embarrassment in her life.

Xu Qi’an easily slapped her back to the ground and said sternly, “Quiet down and look ahead.”

The princess consort bit her lip, suppressing her grievance as she looked forward with watery eyes.

Far in the distance, a fierce battle was unfolding. Three hulking barbarians with azure faces and sharp fangs surrounded a cloaked man wearing a mask. Scattered around them lay dozens of corpses, both human and horse.

The princess consort instinctively edged closer to Xu Qi’an, seeking a sense of security.

“That’s one of King Huai’s spies,” she whispered.

*I know that already. And those three barbarians attacking him seem to be from the Qingyan Tribe...* Xu Qi’an narrowed his eyes as he observed.

According to intelligence, members of the Qingyan Tribe had azure-tinted skin, which was how they got their name: “Azure Visage”. These three had not only blue-tinged skin but also thick layers of keratin on their faces, like natural armour.

This was a common inherited trait among the barbarian tribes.

“It’s clear this is a deliberate ambush. Barbarians targeting one of the Zhenbei King’s spies,” Xu Qi’an said in a low voice.

The princess consort nodded vigorously and moved closer to him. “Then why don’t we just leave?”

Xu Qi’an chuckled and countered, “Why should we leave?”

At that moment, the cloaked man in the distance noticed them and shouted, “It’s you! Hurry back to Sanhuang County for reinforcements! With your speed, you’ll be there in half an incense stick’s time.”

He deliberately infused his tone with surprise and joy, tricking the barbarians into thinking he knew Xu Qi’an.

As expected, the three barbarians hesitated. One of them immediately broke off from the attack, heading straight for Xu Qi’an and the princess consort to silence them and prevent reinforcements.

Seeing this, the cloaked man smirked. As he dodged a barbarian’s blade, his soft sword lashed out, slicing a layer of keratin from his opponent’s arm.

The injured barbarian backed away, clutching his arm and shouting in their tongue, “Quickly kill those two! The two of us can’t handle him alone.”

The barbarian tasked with eliminating Xu Qi’an roared, increasing his speed. He leaped high into the air, soaring like an eagle with his blade poised to strike.

Xu Qi’an remained motionless as if paralyzed by fear. Behind him, the princess consort squatted on the ground, screaming at an ear-piercing pitch.

*Stupid barbarians… t*hought the cloaked man with a cold smile. Tricking them into splitting their forces had worked perfectly. With one less opponent, he could hold out long enough to reach safety.

As for that unlucky guy, dying for himself was a death worth dying. If it really comes to it, he’ll take revenge for the guy and kill these Qingyan tribe spies afterwards.

However, a crisp snap suddenly rang out in the distance. It was the unmistakable sound of steel breaking.

What’s going on? Both the cloaked man and the remaining barbarians paused mid-fight, glancing toward the sound.

What they saw left them dumbfounded.

The man who had been standing still moments ago now radiated a golden light, his body transformed into a dazzling golden figure. The leaping barbarian had landed, staring in shock at his broken blade.

“A warrior monk?” the barbarian muttered, his voice trembling.

The princess consort raised her head, her gaze landing on Xu Qi’an’s gleaming bald head.

*H-he’s bald?!* Her mind reeled. So that’s why he never removed his fur hat, not even while eating, sleeping, or bathing.

The one habit he always had was to steady the hat on his head.

“Incorrect. Your penalty is death.” Xu Qi’an darkened his expression, as he raised out an arm, and grabbed the Qingyan tribe barbarian’s throat.

The barbarian struggled, his face twisted in terror, but his neck was crushed with a sickening crunch.

The body went limp, dangling lifelessly in Xu Qi’an’s grip.

“A Warrior monk!” The two remaining barbarians were overwhelmed with fear. Memories of their tribesmen being slaughtered like weeds during the Battle of Shanhai Pass flooded back.

*A Buddhist monk? No… monks don’t wear clothes like that. His accent… it’s distinctly Central Plains…* The cloaked man’s mind raced as he reevaluated the situation.

“Run!”

The two barbarians simultaneously turned, one fleeing north, one fleeing south.

“Stay here and don’t move. I’ll come back for you after I’ve got them,” Xu Qi’an instructed, glancing back at the princess consort.

He noticed her gaze fixed on his head.

*I feel offended…* he thought, muttering internally. Then, like a golden streak, he pursued the fleeing barbarians, quickly dispatching them both and returning with their corpses in tow.

The black-robed spy hadn’t left and was watching from a distance.

Seizing the opportunity while handling the bodies, Xu Qi’an discreetly pulled a sheet of paper from his sleeve, igniting it with his qi. Activating the Qi-watching technique, he briefly closed his eyes, suppressing the glowing light to avoid alerting the black-robed man.

“Thank you for saving me. May I ask what temple my honourable monk is from?” the black-robed spy ventured, approaching cautiously.

When Xu Qi’an didn’t respond, he hastily added, “The circumstances earlier were dire and left me no choice. I hope you can forgive me.”

*A mere ‘left me no choice’ and the matter is settled? If I were an ordinary man, my head would already be split in two…* Xu Qi’an raised his hand, cutting to the point.

“I am Xu Qi’an, an official sent under imperial orders to investigate the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles case.”

The black-robed spy froze. Beneath his mask, his eyes grew complicated.

*It’s really Xu Qi’an?!*

The thought had flitted through his mind before, given the intelligence reports that Xu Qi’an had gained the indestructible golden body technique during the Buddhist contest.

This man’s Central Plains accent and non-Buddhist attire fit the profile of the official they had been covertly searching for.

His thoughts raced as his gaze shifted to the plain-looking woman nearby. Instinctively, his professional instincts as a spy kicked in, and he began speculating about her identity.

*He’s traveling alone to investigate, but why bring a woman?*

*Could she be someone he rescued along the way? If that were the case, he wouldn’t have kept her by his side—it would jeopardise the investigation and her safety.*

*Is… is she the princess consort?!*

A bold idea struck him. The intelligence from higher-ups indicated that Chu Xianglong’s contingency measures before fleeing confirmed the princess consort had disguise techniques and artefacts to conceal her presence.

After Xu Qi’an’s separation from the envoy following the attack, his actions became a mystery. Despite border closures, no traces of the four barbarian elites had surfaced.

As he pieced it all together, Xu Qi’an spoke again, breaking his reverie.

“She’s your princess consort.”

The princess consort widened her eyes, biting her lip in disappointment and sadness as she looked at Xu Qi’an.

*He just gave me away like that…*

*It’s true… She really is the princess consort…* The black-robed spy’s heart surged with overwhelming excitement.

The princess consort had been found, and he was the one who found her. This was a monumental achievement.

Although he had no idea how Xu Qi’an rescued the princess consort, one thing was clear: Xu Qi’an had chosen to travel alone, likely intending to use the princess consort as leverage against King Huai.

Taking a deep breath, the spy allowed a trace of surprise and gratitude to show as he smiled.

“Many thanks, Sir Xu, for recovering the princess consort. King Huai will reward you generously.”

“Well, then, I won’t stand on ceremony,” Xu Qi’an replied with a smile. “I have a few questions for you. Answer truthfully, and I’ll leave the princess consort in your care.”

The princess consort stepped back, distancing herself from the two men. She bit her lip, her eyes brimming with sorrow.

The black-robed man hesitated briefly before nodding. “Please ask, Sir Xu.”

“What happened with Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles?”

“Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles?” The black-robed man feigned confusion, his expression blank. “I know nothing of such a case. How about this: accompany me to the military camp. We’ll settle the princess consort there first, and whatever assistance you need, you have but to ask. We’ll cooperate fully.”

Xu Qi’an looked at him calmly, his smile faint. “Once I’m in the camp, I’ll be like fish on the chopping block, won’t I?”

The black-robed man’s expression faltered. “What do you mean, Sir Xu? You’re the emperor’s appointed investigator. I wouldn’t dare harm you—we’d gladly treat you as an honored guest.”

He emphasized Xu Qi’an’s official status, attempting to create the illusion that no one would dare touch an imperial envoy.

Xu Qi’an sighed, pointing to his eyes. “But you’ve yet to speak a single truth. I’ve seen it all with the Qi-watching technique.”

The black-robed man’s heart skipped a beat. His instincts for danger drove him to retreat, his soft sword slashing out defensively.

In the next instant, Xu Qi’an’s hand closed around his neck.
