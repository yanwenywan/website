# 219. Well Pleased

Xu Qi'an hung his head, staring at the mirror, waiting for a moment. The first to reply was Number Five, the little Southern Barbarian girl.

【FIVE: Yunzhou is quite far from here, I can't help you.】

*She thought Number Two was asking for help in the real world? Number Five must still be groggy from sleep, but this level of intelligence is really unacceptable…* Xu Qi'an's mouth twitched.

Next was Number Six, Hengyuan: 【What's going on? Is Sir Xu alright in Yunzhou?】

Li Miaozhen first replied that everything was fine, but she didn't rush to reveal the case details, as if waiting for something.

*Was she waiting for me, or for Number One or Four? Probably both... She won’t discuss the case until the brains of the group speak up...* Xu Qi'an understood Number Two's strategy and used his finger as a pen to write:

【THREE: Tell us about the case in Yunzhou.】

Li Miaozhen breathed a sigh of relief and gathered her spirits. If only Number Five and Number Six responded, she wouldn't have planned to say anything.

She then detailed the entire case in the Book of the Earth chat group.

There was a lot of information, so she sent it piece by piece, taking a quarter of an hour to explain everything.

The response was a long silence. Just as she began to feel uneasy and anxious, Number One, who usually liked to lurk, surprisingly took the initiative to write:

【ONE: There are two possibilities: One, Liang Youping isn't actually part of the Qi Clique, and he handed over the ledger to Xu Qi'an with an ulterior motive. Two, Liang Youping has gone missing.】

*Liang Youping is missing…* Li Miaozhen pondered Number One's words. The second possibility was something she hadn't considered.

To be safe, she asked: 【Is there a possibility that Yang Chuannan and Liang Youping are in cahoots and staged a self-harming ruse?】

【ONE: Unlikely. Given the rules of officialdom, Yang Chuannan has to take responsibility this time, the only difference is the severity. If you were Yang Chuannan, would you dig a pit for yourself to fall into?

【Liang Youping killed the original contact and destroyed the problematic parts of the ledger... Personally, I agree with this hypothesis. Therefore, his identity as part of the Qi Clique is highly probable.】

At this point, Number Four spoke up: 【So, Number One thinks the Church of the Warlock God interrogated those two Bronze Gongs in their dreams about Liang Youping's whereabouts because Liang Youping has gone missing.】

Number One's analysis opened Xu Qi'an's mind.

*Liang Youping went missing, so the Church of the Warlock God is desperate to find him? Because if he fell into the "enemy's" hands, he would reveal many unfavorable secrets...*

*The mastermind in Yunzhou believed that we captured Liang Youping, so they sent the Church of the Warlock God to interrogate us in our dreams... Since I have had contact with Liang Youping, I was the most likely person to capture him, but because I haven’t slept, they had to interrogate Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao instead…*

*But why did they wait three days to interrogate?*

Li Miaozhen held the small jade mirror, waiting for a while, but she didn't hear any opinion from Number Three. He only asked a question at the beginning and then fell silent, making Li Miaozhen anxious.

Number Three is extremely clever. His insights and views might not be the standard answers but can certainly provide enough inspiration.

【THREE: Number Three, are you asleep again? What do you think about this case?】

*I’m watching…* Xu Qi'an mentally retorted.

He knew the other members of the Heaven and Earth Society were waiting for his opinion, so he wrote: 【I also have a question: Sixth-rank warlocks have the ability to divine the future, so why couldn't they find Liang Youping's whereabouts? Additionally, warlocks have the ability to kill with curses. If Liang Youping was their accomplice, the most prudent choice upon learning of his disappearance would be to kill him to prevent him from leaking secrets.】

【FOUR: I'll answer that. Warlock curse spells can only target individuals with lower cultivation levels. Given Liang Youping's status, someone must be protecting him. It’s unclear who, as many people could do this.

【As for divination, high-ranking experts from various systems have ways to counter divination against themselves, but they can’t provide protection for others, except for one system.】

At this point, Number Four paused for a few seconds before continuing: 【The Sitianjian arcanists.】

It was like a bolt of lightning striking everyone's minds.

*The Sitianjian arcanists?* Xu Qi'an was shocked.

【TWO: Number Four, are you saying that Liang Youping was kidnapped by Sitianjian arcanists?】

【FOUR: Haha, all these speculations hinge on the premise that Liang Youping is missing.】

【ONE: If Liang Youping was indeed taken by Sitianjian arcanists, why wouldn't Inspector Zhang know? Or, is he deliberately hiding it from Number Two?】

【TWO: It doesn't seem like they're hiding it. They probably really don’t know.】

【FOUR: That makes it even more intriguing. But there’s one thing you should be wary of. If we can figure this out, so can the Church of the Warlock God, given that arcanists counter divination and curses. Hence, tonight's dream interrogation to test if Liang Youping fell into the Nightwatcher's hands.

【Such tests won’t happen just once or twice. We can turn this to our advantage and trace the mastermind. Inform Inspector Zhang, he will know what to do.】

Number One then commented: 【Additionally, the fact that they came to test suggests they’re prepared for Liang Youping falling into the Nightwatcher's hands. At least in their eyes, falling into the hands of the Sitianjian arcanists is the same as falling into the Nightwatcher's hands.

【In that case, they must be ready to go down together.】

These words made Xu Qi'an and Li Miaozhen shiver.

*If that's the case, then we must strike first to gain the upper hand and capture the leader…* Xu Qi'an thought to himself.

*But for now, the priority is to identify the mastermind behind the scenes. Otherwise, the enemy is in the dark while we are in the light, and that’s a losing battle.*

At this moment, Number One asked: 【ONE: Although this case is troublesome, with Xu Qi'an's abilities, he shouldn't be completely helpless, right?】

*Number One, if you can speak, say more; you could even write a book...* Xu Qi'an felt flattered and quite pleased.

Li Miaozhen replied: 【He is attempting to break through to the Refining Spirit stage, and his condition is very poor.】

【SIX: Is Sir Xu already trying to break through to the Refining Spirit stage? When he left the capital, he was just short of reaching the peak of the Refining Qi stage. I thought he would take until spring to reach Refining Spirit. Truly a surprising talent.】

Only Xu Qi'an knew the real reason. As he reached Refining Qi, he suddenly had a massive amount on his plate, leaving relatively little time for cultivation.

On the journey to Yunzhou however, apart from bragging with colleagues, most of the time was boring, so he could only cultivate. Hence, the rapid progress.

【ONE: No, such talent would shake the world.】

Initially, everyone wasn't too concerned. After all, a seventh-rank warrior at the Refining Spirit stage wasn't a big deal. The members of the Heaven and Earth Society were all talented, intelligent, and articulate. A Refining Spirit stage warrior wouldn't cause much of a stir.

But hearing Numbers One and Six speak so highly of him piqued everyone's interest, including Li Miaozhen, who had met Xu Qi'an in the real world.

【FOUR: Judging by your tone, this Bronze Gong seems quite exceptional, a prodigy even?】

Monk Hengyuan thought for a moment and replied: 【Not exactly. When he left the capital, he saw me, and given his condition at that time, he should have broken through to the Refining Spirit stage by spring. I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. Number One knows him better.】

【ONE: I mentioned his background before, but I didn't tell you that when Xu Qi'an joined the Nightwatchers, he was only at the Refining Vitality stage. Up till now, it’s been only two months.】

No need to say more, everyone knew the significance of this statement.

Crossing a rank in two months was top-tier talent, regardless of the system or faction.

Number Four couldn't help but think that Number Three, suspected to be Xu Qi'an's cousin, might have something to do with this brilliant cousin. Now, with such an outstandingly talented Xu Qi'an, the Xu family in the capital might soon become a rising star.

Daoist Jinlian giving the Earth Book fragment to that cousin might have been a plan to benefit both brothers.

Li Miaozhen was shocked. What Number One had told her that day was all about Xu Qi'an's prowess in solving cases, but he hadn't mentioned his innate talent.

…How many sleepless nights must he have endured? Li Miaozhen suddenly became very curious about this question.

【FIVE: It's alright, crossing one rank in two months.】

Number Five, who had been unable to get a word in, sent this evaluation.

【THREE: That's already quite impressive.】

Xu Qi'an used his alternate account to boast about himself.

【FIVE: Yes, I didn't say it wasn't. I also crossed a rank in two months. Now I'm preparing to cultivate the Life Gu, which is a sixth-rank. It took me just over four months to go from the eighth rank to the sixth rank.】

?

A big question mark appeared in everyone's mind.

*Crossing two ranks in four months and one rank in two months, it makes sense...* The members of the Heaven and Earth Society seemed to understand why Daoist Jinlian invited Number Five to join.

Li Miaozhen excitedly rolled on the table, clenched her fist, and waved it vigorously. Indeed, seeking help from the members of the Heaven and Earth Society was the right choice.

With the deep-thinking Number One, the experienced Number Four, and the extremely intelligent Number Three, they quickly sorted out the details of the case.

They even provided her with a plan for the next steps.

…

The next day, Xu Qi'an, sporting dark circles under his eyes, arrived in the hall for breakfast. Before long, Inspector Zhang and Jiang Lyuzhong also came down.

Li Miaozhen was the last to appear, dressed in soft armour, carrying a silver spear, and with a sword at her waist. Her high ponytail swayed stylishly. Behind her followed the stunningly beautiful demon.

Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao tacitly turned their backs, presenting the back of their heads to Susu.

Li Miaozhen went straight to the table of Inspector Zhang and Jiang Lyuzhong, glanced at Xu Qi'an first, then raised her sharp chin proudly and said, "I've solved the case!"

Inspector Zhang and Jiang Lyuzhong exchanged a look, with the former's eyes flickering slightly, "Let's talk in the room. Ningyan, you come too."

In the room, Li Miaozhen vividly recounted the "chat log," leaving Inspector Zhang and Jiang Lyuzhong bewildered.

"General Li, your attention to detail is impressive. I am in awe," Inspector Zhang said, feeling invigorated and shedding much of his overnight fatigue.

Jiang Lyuzhong also began to see this beautiful, almond-faced female general in a new light.

Li Miaozhen smiled reservedly, then suddenly turned to Xu Qi'an, "You don't seem to be convinced by this general's reasoning?"

*Nonsense, we are in the same group. Why put on airs in front of me… Acting when you don't need to...* Xu Qi'an cooperatively displayed a look of shock and admiration, praising, "General Li's ability to solve cases and reason is far superior to mine. I am deeply impressed."

Li Miaozhen smiled faintly, "This general didn't expect to have some talent for solving cases."

She felt ecstatic to be able to outshine Xu Qi'an, a skilled expert, in his presence.

Xu Qi'an also felt quite pleased because when his identity was revealed in the future, he wouldn't be the only one to suffer social death.

For some reason, he suddenly felt that the future was bright… Xu Qi'an smiled.

...

After breakfast, Inspector Zhang was about to head to the Headquarters of the Military Command when a Huben Guard came in to report:

"Inspector, Commissioner Song is here with a group of officials to visit!"

Inspector Zhang immediately exchanged a silent glance with Jiang Lyuzhong and the other two.

Clearly, the Yunzhou officials had come regarding the arrest of Commissioner Yang Chuannan last night. But after their earlier conversation, they were more cautious.

Perhaps this was also a probe—a probe from the mastermind behind the scenes.
