# 435. Great Scholar Peiman Xilou

Peiman Xilou made a formal bow, squinting as he smiled. “Where is Sir Xu currently serving?”

Xu Xinnian replied courteously, “The Hanlin Academy.”

“The Great Feng court sent a mere seventh-rank official to receive us?”

A cold voice interjected. Behind Peiman Xilou, a youth with a feminine demeanour and vertical pupils spoke with displeasure.

“And what kind of person are you?” Xu Xinnian countered.

The youth with the vertical pupils lifted his chin and was about to speak when Xu Xinnian said flatly, “Oh, I forgot. You’re not a person.”

The boy was enraged by his cold sarcasm and sneered. “This young master carries the blood of ancient divine demons. You mortals are beneath me.”

“Then why haven’t you ascended to the heavens? What are you still doing here among mortals?” Xu Xinnian asked in mock surprise.

“You...”

The youth flushed red, glaring at him furiously. Back in the north, anyone who dared speak to him like this would already be in his belly.

“Xuanyin, do not be rude.”

Peiman Xilou squinted with a smiling face. “Xuanyin is of the bloodline of the great yao Zhujiu. He’s long been used to disregarding others. Sir Xu is right to scold him. He does indeed lack discipline.”

Under Peiman Xilou’s glance, the vertical-pupilled youth immediately fell silent.

“Though this Sir Xu holds a low post, he is the most refined among the refined. The Hanlin Academy admits only the top scholars. How could a bastard creature like you compare?”

Peiman Xilou offered generous praise. “I am Peiman Xilou.”

*I didn’t even scold him. If I really wanted to, you lot wouldn’t get into the capital until tomorrow…* Xu Xinnian nodded slightly.

Huang Xian’er gave a sly smile, her gaze shifting to Xu Xinnian. The first character of the Peiman surname of the White Head Tribe was identical to the Pei surname of the Central Plains. Most people of the Central Plains would mistake the Peiman clan for the Pei clan.

She hoped to see this young official embarrass himself by mixing up the names, so she could seize the moment to appear gentle and alluring, stirring his heart.

Xu Xinnian nodded. “Envoy Peiman, this official will escort you to the courier station to rest.”

Huang Xian’er was a little disappointed. This young official of the Great Feng had some real ability, making her later attempts at seduction more difficult.

Peiman Xilou had never intended to use such petty tricks to trip up someone from the Hanlin Academy. He mounted his horse and, with the envoy group, departed the pier under the escort of two hundred Great Feng soldiers.

After passing through several small streets, they arrived at the city’s main thoroughfare. The sight before them left the yao and barbarian envoys dumbfounded.

The street was unimaginably wide, enough for fifty horsemen to ride abreast. The buildings on either side stood in neat rows stretching into the distance, and the banners of the shops fluttered in the wind.

Such splendour, such prosperity! They had never seen the like in their lives.

Huang Xian’er’s charming gaze turned dreamy. Now she understood why her ancestors longed so fervently to head south into the Central Plains, to seize this land.

But then she sensed something was wrong. Both sides of the main road were lined with human civilians. In their baskets were vegetable leaves, rotten eggs, even stones.

Their faces bore expressions of rage, and hatred burned in their eyes.

“Beat the yao and barbarians to death!”

Someone shouted and hurled a rotten egg at the envoy group, igniting an uproar like a fuse being lit.

“Kill the monsters!”

“Get out of the capital!”

…

Vegetable leaves, rotten eggs, stones, mouldy rice balls—all came flying toward the envoy group in a storm of filth.

The barbarian temperament was impulsive and violent. Provocation was the last thing they could endure. They immediately bared their teeth, eyes flashing with fury.

“Sir Xu, the people of Great Feng are quite… passionate,” Peiman Xilou said with a smile, using his inner strength to deflect the filth.

Xu Xinnian replied coolly, “Yes, they were worried you might go hungry.”

Peiman Xilou was momentarily speechless, unsure how to respond.

After all, the yao and barbarians frequently raided the borderlands for one thing—food.

Huang Xian’er frowned again and again, visibly irritated. Though they could use their qi to block the filth, being treated this way was enough to enrage even the most patient.

Just then, she heard Peiman Xilou ask, “These commoners seem to be particularly mindful of you, Sir Xu?”

Only then did Huang Xian’er notice that as the crowd threw their rotten eggs and leaves, they were deliberately avoiding the young official. Yet the accompanying soldiers of Great Feng were not so lucky.

With that realisation, she narrowed her eyes and observed carefully. She noticed even more.

It was not just care, they were taking great pains to avoid hitting him, even aiming carefully.

The human commoners seemed to revere him, fearful of accidentally striking him…

Huang Xian’er looked at Xu Xinnian in astonishment, her curiosity piqued.

*A mere Hanlin Bachelor could never earn such treatment. He must hold another identity, one known and respected by the common folk…* Peiman Xilou narrowed his eyes, lost in thought.

Xu Xinnian chuckled. “They’re not being careful of me. They’re being careful of the sign hanging from the horse.”

Sign?

Huang Xian’er blinked. She and Peiman Xilou only now noticed a wooden sign hanging from the horse’s neck.

Xu Xinnian leaned over, took the sign down, and showed it to them.

It had five characters written on it: Younger brother of Silver Gong Xu.

*Younger brother of Silver Gong Xu?!* Huang Xian’er’s voice turned sweet and coquettish. “What does that mean\~\~?”

Peiman Xilou’s squinted eyes opened a little, a flash of understanding crossing his face. “No wonder, no wonder. So Sir Xu is the younger brother of Great Feng’s Silver Gong, Xu Qi’an.”

The White Head Tribe had a secret chamber where confidential files were stored, backed by an enormous intelligence network. At the helm of that network was Peiman Xilou, nicknamed the bookworm of the barbarian race.

He had once personally penned the report on that legendary Silver Gong of Great Feng.

Rising at the end of the official examination year, in less than a year, he had gone from an unremarkable constable of Changle County to the brightest star in all of Great Feng.

His talent was terrifying, but what was even more unsettling was not his strength, but his prestige.

After the Chuzhou massacre, his reputation reached its peak, a peak that inspired awe.

Just how high was that reputation? At the time, Peiman Xilou had written, “All the people of the capital, without exception, adore him.” Now, seeing the effect of a single wooden sign, he resolved to add one more line when he returned: His blessing extends to his kin.

Huang Xian’er clearly recalled the legendary Silver Gong as well and looked stunned.

*In our divine race, only the chieftain commands such reverence…* Huang Xian’er’s anticipation for this journey to the capital deepened.

The barbarian tribes possessed divine demon blood and often called themselves the divine race.

Escorted by throngs of capital citizens, Xu Xinnian led the envoy group into the courier station.

Once the envoys were settled, Xu Xinnian, having been sent on this errand by Emperor Yuanjing, stayed for an hour under Peiman Xilou’s insistence before taking his leave.

He didn’t return to report in at his office either, skipping work for the rest of the day and leisurely heading home.

…

“The elder brother is already a rare talent. I didn’t expect this younger brother to be so sharp-tongued and equally gifted.” After sending off Xu Xinnian, Peiman Xilou sat in the courtyard drinking tea.

During the hour they spent together, every reference he made, the other could follow. They talked history and discussed classical philosophy. Xu Xinnian’s words flowed like a stream, eloquent and witty. When the conversation turned to the old grudge between the Great Feng and the northern divine clans, his words became laced with thorns, full of sarcasm and biting criticism.

Huang Xian’er was sitting on a stone stool, deliberately striking a seductive pose that left the surrounding couriers dazed and distracted. Hearing this, she gave a coquettish snort and said:

“Just a clueless, dull scholar.”

She had been hinting and teasing all the way through, yet that damned scholar paid her no mind. Truly like casting flirtations at a blind man.

Nibbling on dried fruit and jerky from the stone table, Huang Xian’er asked, “Tomorrow we’ll enter the palace to see the human emperor. What’s your plan? If you’re not confident in getting reinforcements soon, be sure to let me know early.”

Peiman Xilou dismissed the couriers from the courtyard and said with a smile, “And how do you plan to respond?”

Huang Xian’er yawned lazily, her posture languid and alluring:

“Then I won’t return to the north! I’ll pick a high-ranking official in the capital and become his concubine. Isn’t that better than going back to be punished? Besides, we’re under the Jianzheng’s watchful eye in the capital, our divine clansmen wouldn’t dare take revenge.”

Peiman Xilou chuckled and said, “If the Great Feng is to send troops to aid our divine clan, it’s inevitable we’ll have to offer concessions. Our visit here is nothing more than to haggle over terms.

“Our side is the one asking for help and has already lost the initiative. If we want to stand on equal footing, we first have to curb their arrogance. Only when they show us respect can we expect concessions at the negotiating table.

“Of course, we’ll also need your fox tribe’s efforts off the table. Of the three poisons—wine, sex, and money—sex leads the way.”

The slit-pupilled youth Xuanyin seized the chance to cut in with a cold snort. “The human race is as lowly as ants. In the ancient era, they were livestock, raised for blood and flesh by our divine and demonic ancestors. Even now, in the post-mythical age, human commoners are still just food.”

He knew their diplomatic mission was to seek help from the Great Feng, but he still looked down on the physically weak human race.

Peiman Xilou glanced at him and smiled warmly, his eyes squinting:

“Those are words for private settings. If you dare spout them in public, I’ll skin you alive.”

Xuanyin pouted, “I know, didn’t I wait until the couriers were gone?”

Peiman Xilou took out a small box from the tribute they’d brought. Carefully and solemnly, he opened it, revealing a collection of books inside.

All the books shared one title: _The Beizhai Compendium_.

“*Beizhai* is my study. I loved reading since I was young. I never sought deep understanding, just memorisation. Later, I followed my clan south, capturing human scholars. The first three years, I listened to their lectures. The middle three, I debated with them. The last three, of all the scholars we captured in the north, none surpassed me in knowledge.

“I was eighteen that year. To study in the south, I even dyed my hair black. At twenty, the idea of writing a book struck me. After ten years of study in the Central Plains, I compiled all I’d learned into this work, revising it again and again. Back then, I hadn’t decided on a name.

“Not until I returned to the tribe and stood once more in my Beizhai study did I realise what it should be called. For the next six years, I poured heart and soul into it. _The Beizhai Compendium_ was finally completed.

“The work is vast, three hundred and eight volumes in all, covering history, agriculture, commerce, astronomy, and geography. Didn’t the Great Feng say we savages have no history? We do, they just haven’t seen the _Beizhai Compendium_. If their historians read it, they’d be overjoyed.

“Of course, the part I’m proudest of is the military section. I’ve read nearly all the Great Feng’s military texts. As for the works of past masters, I won’t speak of them. The only current work worth mentioning is _Six Treatises on the Art of War_ by Zhang Shen, a grand scholar of Cloud Deer Academy. It’s not bad—but it focuses too much on cultivators’ roles in warfare.

“It neglects the importance of common soldiers. If you remove the cultivators, what’s left of _Six Treatises on the Art of War_ is utter nonsense.”

Huang Xian’er had been drifting off, but her interest was piqued at the mention of military strategy.

“Mortals play only a small role in battle. What’s wrong with focusing on cultivators?”

Peiman Xilou shook his head.

“Do you know why Wei Yuan was able to win the Battle of Shanhai Pass? How he earned his reputation as a military god? Only he could wield ordinary troops like a divine brushstroke. He is a true commander. If he had five hundred thousand ordinary soldiers, without a single cultivator, he could sweep across Jiuzhou.

“I’ve studied that battle. Over a million troops were committed from all sides. The number of common soldiers reached a terrifying scale. When such a force is perfectly controlled and deployed, it becomes unstoppable.”

*Very impressive, I don’t understand a thing…* Huang Xian’er said sweetly, “What if I go seduce Wei Yuan? If I can win him over, our mission would be a resounding success.”

“Do you have a death wish?” Peiman Xilou replied.

Huang Xian’er giggled seductively.

Of course, she was only joking. To be chosen as one of the mission’s leaders, she was no fool.

…

The next day, the delegation of Yao and barbarians entered the palace to be received. Passing through the Meridian Gate, across the Jinshui Bridge, they entered Jinluan Hall to meet the emperor.

All along the way, Huang Xian’er showed no sense of solemnity before a sovereign. Her eyes flirted with the guards and officials, seducing every man in sight.

Only upon entering Jinluan Hall, where high officials flanked either side and Emperor Yuanjing sat atop the dragon throne, did she tone it down slightly, though she still greeted him in a sweet, cloying voice.

Then came the formal tribute from the Yao and barbarian clans. Besides material offerings, they also presented three stunning fox-women—top-grade cauldrons.

It was common practice for foreign tribes to include beauties among their tributes.

Once the old eunuch finished his ceremonial chant, Emperor Yuanjing smiled with satisfaction and said:

“We hear the northern front burns with war and we are deeply troubled. However, with the autumn harvest upon us, the people are preoccupied. We cannot spare the forces to march north. We’ve instructed the Hanlin Academy to draft military texts, I hope they might aid you in resisting the enemy.”

He first explained the court’s difficulty: with harvest season, it’s not the right time for war. Then, by gifting military texts, he showcased the strength of Great Feng’s military doctrine.

“Thank you, Your Majesty! May the Great Feng and our divine clan forge an eternal bond of friendship.” Peiman Xilou prostrated himself with utmost respect.

The audience concluded. Even as he left, Peiman Xilou never once mentioned requesting aid.

How composed!

Among the court officials, some were surprised, some sneered, and some found it amusing.

In their view, the barbarians were even cruder than martial men. They should’ve rushed to beg for reinforcements, that would’ve been the expected course.

Who would’ve thought Peiman Xilou could hold his nerve? Yet, even so, he would still have to speak up eventually. Putting on a show of restraint meant little on the court floor.

Once outside the palace, the slit-pupilled youth Xuanyin could no longer hold it in and blurted out:

“Brother Peiman, didn’t you say Great Feng’s military texts were rubbish? Weren’t you going to defeat them in the field they take most pride in and earn their respect? Why didn’t you say anything just now?”

Huang Xian’er chuckled:

“What’s the point of showing off to people like that? Even if you dazzle them to the heavens, they’ll pretend not to see. They’ll devour you all the same.”

She turned to Peiman Xilou and asked, “Who are you planning to target first?”

Peiman Xilou replied coolly, “The Imperial Academy.”

…

Not long after midday, news spread from the Imperial Academy: the barbarian envoy leader, Peiman Xilou, had visited the Academy and debated with the Grand Academician—and won.

*This man is erudite and refined. I am not his equal…* was the Grand Academician’s appraisal.

Peiman Xilou did not leave afterwards. He boldly lectured at the Academy and left behind his own work, the _Beizhai Compendium_.

A mere barbarian writes books?

At first, the students were furious, but as the book’s reputation grew, the insults gradually faded, replaced by shock at the barbarian’s scholarship.

The _Beizhai Compendium_ was vast in scale and depth, astonishing in scope. It was clearly not compiled in a day or two.

Such a monumental work was typically compiled by the court itself. It was hard to believe that a young barbarian had done it alone.

For this book alone, Peiman Xilou could rank among the great scholars of the age.

Most astonishing were several volumes in the Canon that recorded the history of the Yao and barbarian clans in detail, their origins, evolution, especially the last eight hundred years. It was no less comprehensive than the Great Feng’s official histories.

It was a resounding slap to the face of the Imperial Academy, a resounding slap to the face of the Great Feng’s scholars.

Peiman Xilou’s fame exploded overnight.

“Hard to believe such uncultured barbarins could produce a true scholar.”

“Peiman Xilou hails from the White Head Clan, known for their cleverness, but even so, someone like him is exceedingly rare.”

“If I could write a book like that, my name would live on through the ages. That barbarian is remarkable.”

“Shameful, shameful. At his age, I was still studying. Now that I’m old, I no longer have the energy to write.”

“This man is loathsome. First he challenges the Grand Academician, then he leaves behind his book as if showing magnanimity, it’s a slap to our scholars’ faces.”

Precisely because he was a barbarian, his scholarship stood out, highlighting the incompetence of the Great Feng’s literati, most of whom could not hope to achieve what he had.

“If there’s anyone among the younger generation who could match his learning, it would only be Princess Huaiqing.”

“Princess Huaiqing studied both at the Imperial Academy and Cloud Deer Academy. But he, a barbarian, is self-taught. The difference is clear.”

The barbarian envoy had captured everyone’s attention, not only in court and academic circles, but also among the common folk of the capital.

Initially, they debated whether the court should send troops to aid the Yao and barbarians. But gradually, word spread from restaurants and brothels that a northern barbarian was a great scholar.

“Nonsense. How could an uncultured barbarian know anything of learning? To think he humbled the Grand Academician? Which fool made up that rumour?”

No one believed it. They scoffed.

In the eyes of the people, the Imperial Academy was the official school, the source of literary stars.

Scholars held immense prestige.

But for that very reason, once the news was confirmed, public outrage erupted. People no longer debated sending troops, they were united in denouncing the Academy, saying it had shamed the empire and the Great Feng.

“Useless, complacent fools, the whole lot of them.”

“Even a mere warrior like Silver Gong Xu could become the poetry champion of the realm. That says enough about the uselessness of the Academy’s scholars — drunken gluttons, the lot of ‘em!”

“You sound like you’re insulting Silver Gong Xu.”

“That’s not what I meant. I’m just furious at the Academy’s incompetence.”

“A shameful disgrace! To lose to a barbarian in learning, a disgrace! Has our Great Feng no one left?”

...

The courier station.

The slit-pupilled youth Xuanyin returned, a small box of books slung over his shoulder. He deliberately dropped it with a thud and laughed loudly toward Peiman Xilou and Huang Xian’er in the courtyard:

“Those useless scholars at the Academy didn’t even dare stop me when I said I was borrowing books for Big Brother Peiman. They may curse you all they like, but that just means they’re scared. Scared of your knowledge.”

Though he didn’t believe in studying himself, seeing a barbarian crush the human race in their own field was exhilarating.

“Just a book exchange, that’s all…” Peiman Xilou treated the books like treasure, picking through them carefully.

“That so-called Grand Academician was the most learned among them, and even he lost to you. Seems the human scholars aren’t much after all,” Xuanyin laughed heartily.

Exhilarating!

“The Grand Academician maybe learned, but the human literary world is resplendent, he does not represent humanity. In the palace is a remarkable woman. Her scholarship is the real deal.”

Peiman Xilou picked out a book of commentary on the Four Books and read with relish.

Three days had passed since the “debate” at the Imperial Academy. The Yao and barbarians in the envoy were both surprised and delighted to find that their leader, Peiman Xilou, had become a sensation.

He was now the centre of discussion, a source of great shock to the human race.

Huang Xian’er dabbed at rouge she’d bought from the shops and casually asked, “You’ve made quite a name for yourself now. Is it time for negotiations?”

She hadn’t been idle either; she’d slipped several stunning fox women to various Great Feng officials.

“Not yet.”

Peiman Xilou didn’t look up, replying as he read:

“I heard there’s a literary gathering at the palace the day after tomorrow, focused on the northern war. A literary meet, perfect for fame. Xian’er, spread the word. Say I’ll be attending and want to seek advice from the Cloud Deer Academy’s great scholar Zhang Shen on the art of war. I hope he will attend.”

“The great scholar of Cloud Deer might not bother with you,” Huang Xian’er said lazily.

“If he doesn’t, it only makes me look better,” Peiman Xilou smiled. Then, remembering something, he added:

“Oh also, we can’t climb Qingyuan Mountain, it’ll suppress us. Go find Xu Xinnian. I’ve checked, he’s a student of Cloud Deer Academy.”

“Got it!”

The slit-pupilled youth grew excited. He could feel that in the eyes of the humans, Brother Peiman was becoming “stronger.”

Brother Peiman’s plan was proceeding smoothly.

…

Just as one wave settled, another surged. While the scholars of the literary world were still poring over and copying the _Beizhai Compendium_, immersed in its vastness, they were suddenly shaken by Peiman Xilou’s bold move to seek instruction in military strategy from the great scholar Zhang Shen.

*What was this barbarian thinking?*

After slapping the face of the Imperial Academy, was he now aiming to slap the face of Cloud Deer Academy too?

The whole affair became a hot topic. Scholars from the Imperial Academy were both furious and eager.

Cloud Deer Academy was not one to be trifled with.

That barbarian, unaware of the heights of heaven and depths of earth, dared to consult the great scholar Zhang Shen on the art of war. He was asking for a beating.

They only hoped that the scholars of Cloud Deer Academy would temporarily set aside their pride. If they scorned the barbarian and refused his “consultation,” they’d merely become his stepping stone to fame.

In the imperial study, small court.

Emperor Yuanjing sat behind his large desk, sweeping his cold gaze across the assembled ministers.

“What are my lords’ thoughts on recent events?”

He was, of course, referring to Peiman Xilou’s string of bold actions: besting the Imperial Academy in scholarship, gaining fame through the _Beizhai Compendium_, and now seeking to challenge the great scholar Zhang Shen at the upcoming literary gathering.

“This man clearly wishes to make a name for himself in the capital to build prestige and gain leverage for the negotiations.”

“Hmph, he thinks that by doing this, the court will make concessions? Delusional.”

“Even if he truly defeats Zhang Shen, we won’t give an inch.”

Emperor Yuanjing frowned. The more they spoke like this, the more it revealed their growing apprehension toward Peiman Xilou—treating him as a major figure, a great scholar.

Once their mindset shifted, it would affect the negotiations.

Negotiating with a nameless nobody was not the same as negotiating with a renowned scholar of the age.

Prime Minister Wang stepped forward and said in a deep voice, “We must curb his momentum. Ideally, we should shatter his aura and dismantle the prestige he’s built.”

Emperor Yuanjing snorted coldly. “Then we can only pin our hopes on Zhang Shen.”

Wei Yuan shook his head with a wry smile.

…

Huaiqing Manor.

Huaiqing, dressed in a plain but elegant palace gown, held a borrowed volume of the _Beizhai Compendium_ from the Imperial Academy and read it with tireless focus.

Xu Qi’an and Lin’an sat at the same table, one with furrowed brows, the other pouting slightly.

Taking advantage of Huaiqing’s inattention, Biaobiao peeled a grape and popped it into Xu Qi’an’s mouth. He spat out the seed and asked, “Is this blasted book really that incredible?”

Huaiqing nodded slightly without lifting her head. “Had Peiman Xilou been born in the Great Feng, he would have become a great scholar of his generation, his name recorded in history.”

Xu Qi’an took a deep breath. “If this man could compile the _Beizhai Compendium_, then his grasp of military theory must also be well-honed. Daring to challenge Zhang Shen suggests he’s fairly confident. Zhang Shen’s _Six Treatises on the Art of War_ is widely known, and Peiman Xilou clearly knows of Zhang Shen, while Zhang Shen knows nothing of him.”

To be fair, Xu Qi’an didn’t want to see the barbarian tribes gain any advantage. The Great Feng’s expedition was inevitable, but they couldn’t let the northern barbarians benefit too cheaply.

Over the past twenty years, the Yao and barbarian tribes had frequently raided the borders, pillaging, killing, even eating humans. Back in Chuzhou, Xu Qi’an had personally witnessed the displaced people, destitute and starving, sleeping rough.

He had also seen how constant warfare had left the poor struggling to survive.

Looking across Great Feng, Chuzhou was one of the most impoverished provinces, plagued by war for years, all thanks to the barbarian tribes.

Huaiqing pursed her soft pink lips, her tone unusually grave:

“Teacher Zhang once served on the battlefield in his youth. Later, when his career stalled, he resigned from office. He does have deep insight into military strategy, but that was decades ago. For the past decades, he’s lived in seclusion at the academy. I fear he’s long since grown rusty.”

Xu Qi’an felt a weight settle in his heart.

To speak of military theory, the only one he had ever studied in his past life was _The Art of War_ by Sun Tzu. Not only had he read it—he’d memorised it.

Of course, Xu Qi’an had never done so willingly. It was assigned reading by a teacher.

So many years later, he’d forgotten most of it.

But thanks to his transformation after reaching the Refining Spirit stage, his soul had evolved beyond the mortal realm. He could now recall _The Art of War_ in detail.

Moreover, in Jiuzhou, with its cultivation and powers beyond mortal men, military theory tended to favour direct, overwhelming force. For example, a fourth-rank expert could wipe out an entire cavalry unit of ordinary soldiers.

Tactics weren’t as necessary.

Whereas _The Art of War_, born of a mortal world, leaned towards precision and subtlety, manoeuvres requiring finesse.

“Come to the literary gathering with me the day after tomorrow,” said Huaiqing.

“If Zhang Shen attends, Erlang will definitely be there. I can’t disguise myself as him,” Xu Qi’an frowned.

“Then disguise yourself as someone else and act as my guard,” Huaiqing said smoothly, offering a solution.

“Alright.”
