# 425. The Missing Recorder

“Why do you want to check the Ministry of Personnel’s archive?” Prime Minister Wang furrowed his brow.

"Checking on someone."

Xu Qi’an blew away the tea froth and took a sip, speaking leisurely, "Don't worry, I won’t cause any trouble. No need for concern, Prime Minister."

Prime Minister Wang nodded. What trouble could arise in the archive? The worst-case scenario would be setting fire to the records, but that wouldn't benefit Xu Qi’an.

He was simply curious about what Xu Qi’an was up to.

"I'm investigating a case," Xu Qi’an said.

*A case? He no longer holds an official post—what case could he be investigating?* A hint of curiosity and surprise flashed in Prime Minister Wang's eyes. After a brief pause, he said mildly,

"May I hear about it?"

"Of course. In fact, it involves you, Prime Minister Sir." Xu Qi’an smiled.

Prime Minister Wang was taken aback. His previously relaxed posture straightened, his expression turning serious, as if he had entered a formal discussion.

Then, he saw a secret letter slip out from Xu Qi’an’s sleeve. With a light flick of his palm, the letter floated onto the desk before him.

With a puzzled mind, Prime Minister Wang unfolded the letter and read. At first, he was stunned, then his brows knitted tightly, as if trying to recall something. In the end, only confusion remained.

Prime Minister Wang placed the letter on the desk and looked at Xu Qi’an. "I… don't remember this."

*As expected!* Xu Qi’an pondered. "Do you recall the Su Hang mentioned in the letter, Prime Minister Sir?"

"I have no impression of this person."

Prime Minister Wang shook his head. Then, after a few moments of deep thought, he looked at Xu Qi’an with a grave expression. "Young Master Xu, what case are you investigating? Is the content of this letter true?"

He had no memory of cooperating with the Duke of Cao back then and remained sceptical of the letter’s claims.

Xu Qi’an considered this, weighing the situation in his heart, before deciding to reveal a little of the truth. He nodded.

"The content of the letter is entirely accurate. As for why Prime Minister you’ve forgotten, is because this matter involves arcanists. Heaven’s secrets have been obscured, which is why those involved have lost their memories."

*Involving arcanists… Heaven’s secrets obscured…* Prime Minister Wang’s expression changed slightly. He realised the gravity of the situation and leaned forward slightly.

"Could you explain in more detail, Young Master Xu?"

Without hesitation, Xu Qi’an recounted the old case of Su Hang, merely mentioning that he had promised a friend to uncover the truth behind her father’s execution. In the process, he had unintentionally discovered Duke Cao’s secret letter. The erased text, combined with his past experiences, led him to conclude that this case was highly significant—so much so that it required a high-ranked arcanist to obscure heaven’s secrets.

Prime Minister Wang listened in silence, leaning back in his chair without speaking for a long while.

"In the Sitianjian, only the Jianzheng has the ability to veil Heaven’s secrets." Prime Minister Wang pressed his fingers against his brow, as if questioning himself. "Why would the Jianzheng do this?"

*How would I know? That’s what I’m investigating…* Xu Qi’an shook his head.

"I will write you a letter. With it, you may freely enter and exit the Ministry of Personnel. If you ever need assistance, just ask." Prime Minister Wang fixed his gaze on Xu Qi’an.

"But I have one condition—if you uncover the truth, I hope you will inform me. I will also investigate this matter in secret."

Back then, something significant had happened at court—an event that had been wiped from the world, leaving even him, a direct participant, with no recollection.

For the Jianzheng to take action to veil it, it had to be an extraordinary matter.

Xu Qi’an nodded and thanked him politely.

…

After sending Xu Qi’an off, Prime Minister Wang summoned his steward, speaking in a calm tone. "Is the second son of the Xu family still here?"

Yesterday, he had told Wang Simu that he wished for Xu Erlang to stay for dinner.

"He is. Shall I call him over?"

The steward immediately understood his master's meaning and bowed before retreating.

A moment later, Xu Erlang, dressed in a white long robe, entered the room with composed manners, his lips red, his teeth white. He saluted without arrogance or servility. "Prime Minister Sir."

Prime Minister Wang was writing on an open scroll of xuan paper and did not lift his head. "Erlang, what are your ambitions?"

He addressed him as "Erlang" naturally, without the slightest awkwardness.

"Hmm?"

Receiving no response, Wang looked up and found Xu Erlang staring directly at him… staring at him…

The corner of Wang’s mouth twitched. "Good ambition."

He set down his brush and glanced at the words on the paper, then smiled. "If not for your elder brother’s righteous actions, I might have been forced into retirement. In officialdom, the most important thing is knowing when to advance and when to retreat.

"No matter how skilled you are in political manoeuvring, no matter how many followers you have, the one seated on the dragon throne can decide your fate with a single word. The previous Prime Minister was able to retire peacefully only because he learned from his predecessors’ mistakes."

*The previous Prime Minister? That corrupt, sycophantic scoundrel who only knew how to line his own pockets and flatter the emperor…* Xu Xinnian thought to himself.

Wang continued, "Two hundred years ago, during the succession crisis, Cloud Deer Academy withdrew from the court. Lesser Sage Cheng erected a stele at the academy, inscribed with 'Uphold justice and be faithful to morality and the monarch until death.' All of this was to send one message to future generations:

"The emperor is the emperor. The minister is the minister. Grasp this boundary well, and you will rise smoothly in the court."

Xu Erlang frowned slightly. "What if I do not wish to?"

Wang burst into hearty laughter. "If you do not, why pursue office?"

Xu Erlang bowed. "This student understands."

He had read extensively and understood Prime Minister Wang’s words easily. Throughout history, there had been countless powerful ministers, but if the emperor chose to act against them, even those with immense power would, at best, be forced into retirement.

Prime Minister Wang suddenly sighed. "Your elder brother’s character is admirable, but he is unsuited for officialdom. Do not follow in his footsteps."

*Lately, my elder brother has been seeking my guidance—why would I follow him?* Xu Erlang lifted his chin slightly, feeling a touch of pride. "This student understands."

Prime Minister Wang nodded. "Stay for dinner tonight."

…

Ministry of Personnel, the Archives.

Disguised as Xu Xinnian, Xu Qi’an, with the help of an archivist, retrieved the list of newly appointed scholars from the 10th year of Yuanjing.

To his surprise, the _zhuangyuan_ of that year was none other than Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen.

The second place went to Lyi An.

The third place, however, was blank—there was no name recorded.

*Found you…* Xu Qi’an stared at the blank space in silence.

*The missing Recorder was the third-place* tanhua *scholar from the 10th year of Yuanjing, a jinshi of the first rank. Who exactly was he? Why was his name erased from history? Is he alive or dead? Since he entered officialdom, he couldn't have been the first Jianzheng.*

*It must have been the current Jianzheng who did this. But why? What connection does this unnamed Recorder have with Su Hang? Su Hang’s name wasn’t erased, meaning he wasn’t the Recorder, but they must be related.*

Based on the clues at hand, he formed a simple hypothesis:

Back then, there had been a political faction in the court. Su Hang was one of its key members, while the unnamed Recorder was likely the faction’s leader.

This faction had been powerful, but after facing attacks from rival groups, it had met a tragic end. Su Hang’s fate was proof of this.

But what Xu Qi’an couldn't understand was—if it had been just an ordinary political struggle, why would the Jianzheng have erased the recorder's name? Why obscure Heaven’s secrets?

There was undoubtedly a deeper secret hidden within.

*My instincts tell me that this old case is very important. Well, that's stating the obvious—of course, it's important. Otherwise, why would the Jianzheng have intervened to obscure it?*

*Sigh, I hate investigating old cases. No, I hate arcanists the most. Though, Zhong Li and Caiwei, those two little sweethearts, don’t count.*

Xu Qi’an left the Ministry of Personnel, riding his beloved little mare. She clip-clopped leisurely through the streets.

The little mare was very considerate, maintaining a steady pace—neither too fast nor too slow—allowing Xu Qi’an to think while riding, without needing to focus on controlling her.

*When I was investigating the Sangpo case, I also encountered the first Jianzheng. There were no records of him in historical documents. In the end, it was the brilliant Huaiqing who deduced the clues by tracing the decline of Buddhist temples five hundred years ago, narrowing it down to Qinglong Temple. That was how I realised Shenshu was connected to Buddhism and to the flourishing of Buddhism in the Central Plains five centuries ago.*

*Huaiqing’s method can be applied to this Recorder as well. I can look into major events from that era to find leads.*

Having settled on a course of action, he shifted his thoughts to Emperor Yuanjing.

Previously, he had looked into Emperor Yuanjing purely out of an old detective’s instinct. He had felt that if it was just for soul pills, it wouldn’t have been enough to drive Emperor Yuanjing to take such a great risk, collaborating with Zhenbei King to massacre a city.

After all, a soul pill isn’t some kind of miraculous kidney tonic; three doses wouldn’t make him immortal. It was hardly worth slaughtering a whole city over.

But after the trip to Jianzhou, he was more certain than ever that something was off about Emperor Yuanjing. Those who possess fortune cannot attain immortality, so what was that old emperor still struggling for?

As the ruler of a nation, there was no way he didn’t know this secret. His own ancestors—Gaozu and Wuzong—were clear examples.

*The only place I can look for clues now is the imperial records. And it has to be the records of the previous emperor.*

*If Emperor Yuanjing really had a secret, he must have taken steps to cover it up.*

*But he couldn't have erased all traces completely. Perhaps there’s something in the previous emperor’s records, something important yet inconspicuous, something that only someone with the right knowledge would recognise.*

*If there are no leads there, my only option is to ask my kind Auntie. She taught Emperor Yuanjing the Dao for so many years—there’s no way she didn’t notice anything.*

*And after that, there’s the mess surrounding the first Jianzheng. I need to find out where this ‘Xuzhou’ is first. Duke Wei and Erlang will help with that. Oh, right — tomorrow, during my date with Biaobiao, I’ll have her pass a message to Huaiqing, asking her to investigate Xuzhou as well.*

*I should make good use of these academians and have them work for me.*

*Also, I can’t neglect my progress in comprehending ‘Intent.’ Even though I still don’t have any clues.*

*Tomorrow, I’ll take a break and go listen to some music at the goulan. I kind of miss Fuxiang..."*

*So many things to do...* Xu Qi’an swayed rhythmically with the movement of his mare.

—

Back at the Xu residence, from a distance, he saw Susu sitting on the rooftop, holding a red parasol. She looked like an enchanting ghostly figure from the mountains, luring weary travellers to their doom.

Well, she was a ghost after all.

*They’re back...* Xu Qi’an leapt onto the roof and sat down beside the female ghost.

"What do you want?" Susu shot him a glare.

Xu Qi’an poked her chest. With a soft _pop_, his finger passed through.

He immediately felt a little disappointed. "Shouldn't you be heading to the Sitianjian to ask Song Qing for a body by now?"

"Bah! You lecher!"

Susu looked down at her chest, then spat at him in annoyance.

"My master said that if I got a body now, you’d definitely drag me into your room. I think she makes a lot of sense. So, once you’ve uncovered the truth about my father’s case, I’ll go and get a body."

"Your master is outright slandering me."

"Really?" Susu eyed him suspiciously.

"Really. I could sleep with you right here, I don’t need to drag you into a room."

"Get lost!" Susu spat at him again.

Xu Qi’an jumped down from the roof and crossed the courtyard. Outside the kitchen, the cook was slaughtering a goose. Squatting beside her, watching eagerly, was Xu Lingyin, her hair tied into two bun-like knots.

Her master, the little dark-skinned Southern Marches girl, was also squatting beside her.

One big, one small, a stark contrast.

"Lingyin, Big Brother’s back." Xu Qi’an called.

Little Pea ignored him, staring intently at the goose being slaughtered, plucked...

*Is she imagining which part to eat first? This silly child, she only has food on her mind...* Xu Qi’an thought to himself as he stepped into the inner hall.

Inside, Li Miaozhen and Auntie were chatting. On the table were a few leftover pieces of glistening pastries.

Seeing her nephew return, Auntie lifted her sharp chin and gestured. "Those pastries are for you. Lingyin was afraid that if she stayed here, she wouldn’t be able to resist eating them all, so she ran outside."

Xu Qi’an suddenly turned his head towards the door and smiled.

"Where’s Erlang? It’s his rest day today. You went out together, why hasn’t he come back?" Auntie craned her neck to look outside.

"Prime Minister Wang invited him to a banquet. He probably won’t be coming back tonight." Xu Qi’an chuckled.

The city gates closed after dusk, there was no way Xu Erlang would be returning today.

"The Prime Minister invited him to a banquet..." Auntie was utterly shocked.

Though Dalang had ruthlessly exposed Erlang and the Wang family’s young lady before, she hadn’t expected things to progress so quickly.

Nor had she imagined that Prime Minister Wang would actually host a banquet for Erlang.

"This marriage is so mismatched. Ugh, really..." Auntie sighed, a mix of frustration and helplessness. "Marrying a Prime Minister’s daughter is like bringing home a bodhisattva."

"Auntie, you’re the mistress of this household. Once she enters the Xu family, it’ll be up to you to keep her in line." Xu Qi’an fanned the flames.

*With Wang Simu’s personality and capabilities, if she married into the Xu family, she would probably make Auntie cry every day. That would be fun to watch...* Xu Qi’an was already looking forward to it.

Auntie puffed out her chest proudly. "Of course! Even if she’s the Prime Minister’s daughter, once she enters the Xu family, she’ll have to listen to me."

Li Miaozhen glanced at her but said nothing.

…

Dusk, Jiaofangsi.

Inside Reflecting Plum Pavillion’s master bedroom, the sound of violent coughing echoed.

A maid sat under the eaves, tending to a small stove, listening to her mistress cough incessantly inside.

Lady Fuxiang had been ill for some time. Over half a month ago, Reflecting Plum Pavillion had stopped hosting tea gatherings. Since then, she had remained bedridden, growing weaker by the day.

The madam had invited many famous doctors, but none could cure her. Eventually, she stopped calling for physicians altogether.

At first, she had fussed over Fuxiang, calling her "daughter" affectionately. Then her visits grew cold and infrequent. Eventually, she stopped visiting entirely, even transferring away the pretty maids and guards from the courtyard.

After all, there was no need to keep so many people around for someone who was barely clinging to life.

"My lady was so radiant before, the head courtesan of Jiaofangsi, the top oiran, Silver Gong Xu’s beloved. And now, she’s completely fallen. No one comes to visit her anymore. Even Silver Gong Xu has vanished—he hasn’t been to Jiaofangsi in ages."

"Hmph! Some wretched witch must have cursed my lady!" The maid wiped her tears, clenching her fists in anger.
