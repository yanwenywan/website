# 277. Zhong Li the Worker

Young Master Liu and his companions were not having an easy time. After Miss Rongrong was taken away, the young heroes, led by Young Master Liu, quickly returned to the inn to inform the elders about what had transpired.

After a brief discussion, the elders decided not to rush to the Nightwatchers Constabulary to demand her release. Instead, they used their connections and tried to handle the matter through official channels.

Upon learning that it was the Nightwatchers who had taken her, those “connections” in the capital, who held no insignificant positions, showed hesitation. Yet, after being begged with heavy bribes, they reluctantly agreed to help.

However, as soon as they heard the name of the Nightwatcher who had arrested her—Xu Qi'an—their faces turned pale. They waved their hands repeatedly, exclaiming: "Impossible! Can't be done!"

Thus, the whole afternoon was wasted. By the next morning, they had no choice but to brace themselves and visit the Constabulary, hoping that this infamous Silver Gong might show some mercy.

Miss Rongrong's teacher was a charming middle-aged woman, with a round and graceful face that hinted at the beauty she must have been in her youth. Her heart was full of worry, knowing all too well the nature of men. After a whole night, who knew what sort of torture Rongrong might have endured...

Losing her chastity was one thing. Worse would be if she had fallen into the hands of a greedy man who would lock her up in a grand mansion as his plaything. That would be a woman's true tragedy.

Young Master Liu's master, on the other hand, was a composed middle-aged swordsman, distinguished by his deep nasolabial lines and bright, piercing eyes.

The two elders exchanged glances, seeing the same worry and helplessness in each other's gaze.

Even the most arrogant martial artist would keep their temper in check and their claws sheathed within the expert-filled Constabulary.

They waited anxiously for the length of two incense sticks until a young man in a Silver Gong uniform, with a special sword hanging from his waist, stepped into the room and entered the side hall.

"Who here is the teacher of Miss Rongrong?" Xu Qi'an scanned the room before speaking.

The middle-aged woman rose and bowed. "It is this old woman."

*No need to be so modest, Auntie...with a figure and face like yours, how could you call yourself old?* Xu Qi'an nodded and said, “I’ve investigated the matter. It wasn’t Miss Rongrong who stole my artifact but the Thousand Faces Thief, Ge Xiaojing.

"The culprit has been apprehended. You may take Miss Rongrong with you."

Hearing this, the two elders sighed in relief. The young heroes who had come along were also overjoyed.

However, unlike their more innocent younger counterparts, the elders harboured no illusions. Rongrong was likely... 

But for Xu Qi'an to release her after a night of indulgence was already better than they had hoped. They would just have to accept their misfortune.

"Thank you, Sir!" the middle-aged woman said gratefully.

At that moment, Miss Rongrong, led by one of the clerks, entered the side hall.

Her emotions were calm. She cheerfully called out, "Master!" without any sign of breaking down in tears or throwing a tantrum.

The middle-aged woman took this in without showing emotion, only saying, "It’s all right now. This gentleman here is perceptive and has not wronged you."

Miss Rongrong curtsied gracefully and sweetly said, "Thank you, Sir Xu."

The middle-aged swordsman cleared his throat and clasped his fists, "Then, we shall not linger any longer."

He let a stack of silver notes slide from his sleeve and on to the table.

"Take the notes with you," Xu Qi'an said lightly.

He didn’t feel right accepting them. After all, Miss Rongrong hadn’t caused trouble, nor had she stolen anything. The whole affair was merely a misunderstanding.

The middle-aged swordsman, surprised, scrutinised Xu Qi'an with disbelief. Finally, he cupped his fists again, "Many thanks, Sir."

The group of jianghu guests then prepared to leave. But just as they were about to cross the threshold, Xu Qi'an's voice called out from behind, "Hold on!"

The middle-aged swordsman paused, a hint of disdain crossing his face along with a wave of relief. It was only natural for officers to be unable to resist money.

Turning back, he reached into his sleeve for the silver notes, ready to offer them once again. But what he saw was Xu Qi'an unfurling a piece of rice paper and dipping his brush into the ink to write something.

Once he had finished writing, Xu Qi'an pressed his thumb into the ink and left a fingerprint.

Everyone was puzzled, unsure of what he intended.

"This official does not like owing other people." Xu Qi'an said. "Yesterday, I broke this young man’s magic weapon. Take this note to the Sitianjian and find Song Qing. He’ll give you a replacement weapon on my behalf." Xu Qi'an flicked the paper toward the middle-aged swordsman.

The man caught it, thanked Xu Qi'an, and left.

As the group walked out of the Nightwatchers’ Constabulary, the beautiful woman held Miss Rongrong’s hand without saying a word. Finally, one of the young heroes spoke up, his tone a little worried, "Rongrong, did he... Did he bully you last night?"

The young heroes froze for a moment, then stared at her expectantly.

The middle-aged swordsman barked, "Stop spouting nonsense!"

Although he and the woman had long assumed Rongrong’s chastity had been compromised, they had purposely avoided mentioning it. After all, honour was as important to those in the jianghu as to anyone else.

"He didn’t do anything to me. I spent the night alone in a room at the Nightwatchers' constabulary," Rongrong shook her head, explaining, "Though the bedding smelled a bit musty."

After a night had passed, her fear and anxiety had dissipated. She now understood that the Silver Gong was a man of honour.

Since the topic had been broached, the beautiful woman no longer held back her curiosity and asked, "If he didn’t bully you, then why did he arrest you?"

"Well, the item belonging to Sir Xu really was stolen, but the thief was Ge Xiaojing. The reason he arrested me was that Ge Xiaojing disguised herself as me when she committed the theft, which led to the misunderstanding," Rongrong explained.

That made sense...

The beautiful woman frowned. "And why did Ge Xiaojing disguise herself as you?"

Rongrong angrily explained, “The day before yesterday, while drinking with Young Master Liu and the others at the restaurant, I mentioned her by name, saying that the Thousand Faces Thief was a petty criminal, only fit for sneak thievery. How could she possibly be compared to me?

"I suspect that my words reached her ears, and she decided to get back at me by stealing in my guise."

"That sounds about right," Young Master Liu and the others nodded.

Now the story made sense. The Silver Gong was also a victim; arresting Rongrong was just a misunderstanding. He wasn't abusing his authority or being lecherous.

The young knights breathed a collective sigh of relief.

The middle-aged swordsman nodded. "Earlier, I offered him silver notes, but he refused. It's good to see that the young man still holds onto his righteousness."

His tone was full of approval.

Young Master Liu pondered for a moment before asking, "Master... What about the matter of the magic weapon?"

The middle-aged swordsman glanced at his disciple and chuckled, "In the capital, the Sitianjian outranks even the Nightwatchers. Though the Silver Gong has a respectable position, to think he could simply present a note and receive a replacement weapon from the Sitianjian—such a thing is preposterous."

Young Master Liu couldn't hide his disappointment, "Then why did he..."

"Young men are always concerned about saving face," the middle-aged swordsman laughed. "There’s no need for us to take it seriously."

The beautiful woman’s eyes glimmered, and she suggested, "Well, since we have some time on our hands, why don’t we pay a visit to the Sitianjian anyway? We can show the children the tallest building in all of Great Feng."

"Sure, why not."

…

Xu Qi'an held an ancient, yellowed book in his hand as he emerged from the dungeon, having just finished interrogating Ge Xiaojing, the infamous female thief. He had asked her about the secrets of the "Veil of Heaven" technique.

"This thief is quite talented. I'll keep her around; she'll be useful in the future. Ha, stealing my treasure? I'll squeeze every bit of value out of you, and later, I'll drive you like an ox or a horse. Of course, I'll let you graze in the meantime."

Since the Spring Breeze Hall was still under construction, and his office was also being being built, he was currently a Silver Gong without an office, forcing him to once again head over to Min Shan's Gold Jade Hall to borrow a bit of his space.

Upon entering the side hall, he ordered the clerks to bring hot tea and began to read the yellowed book with great interest.

The art of disguise in the Thieves' Guild—no, the Divine Hand Sect—was indeed mysterious. Unlike ordinary disguise techniques, it didn't involve making a lifelike human skin mask. Instead, it directly altered one's appearance. The method involved applying a special potion to the face for the duration of half an incense stick, causing the flesh to heat up and "melt." Then, using a unique qi technique, one’s facial features could be reshaped.

The effect lasted for twenty-four hours, though it could also be undone voluntarily.

For a warrior in the Bronze Skin and Iron Bones stage, the potion's dosage needed to be tripled, and the soaking time extended by an additional quarter of an hour. After all, their skin was exceptionally thick.

*The hardest part of this secret technique is careful observation and repeated practice. It's like painting—beginners start by copying, while advanced artists can freely create, perfectly capturing someone's likeness after just a glance.*

*It's a craft that requires diligent effort. The person I'm most familiar with is Second Uncle and Erlang. Since Second Uncle is an elder, I'll start with Erlang.*

At that moment, a clerk entered, bowing respectfully. "Sir Xu, Duke Wei requests your presence."

...

On the seventh floor, inside the tearoom.

Wei Yuan stood by his desk, holding a brush in hand. His eyes were focused, and he was deeply immersed in his painting.

Without looking up, Wei Yuan continued his strokes and asked, "Have you offended anyone recently?"

Xu Qi'an joked, "Following you, it's impossible not to offend people. I can't even count the enemies I've made."

Wei Yuan gave a nonchalant "hmm" and said, "With that awareness, your future achievements will know no bounds."

After a pause, he added, "The sixth-rank you brought back yesterday was taken away early this morning. Think carefully again—have you offended anyone?"

Xu Qi'an sighed in frustration. "I can't remember, which is why I brought him back. Why did you release him?"

He was complaining about Wei Yuan.

In the Nightwatchers Constabulary, only two people dared speak to Wei Yuan in such a manner—one was Xu Qi'an, and the other was the Vinegar Jar.

Wei Yuan remained silent, slowly sketching on the paper. Finally, he set down the brush and exhaled deeply. "The painting is done."

"What did you paint, Duke Wei?" Xu Qi'an eagerly leaned in.

The painting depicted a beautiful woman in palace attire, wearing a luxurious dress adorned with numerous ornaments. She held a delicate silk fan in her slender hand.

Her beauty was indescribable, not in her facial features but in her aura.

Seeing that it wasn’t the empress, Xu Qi'an grew bold and asked, "This lady is so beautiful. Is she betrothed to anyone? Do you know her, Duke Wei? Your humble subordinate is still unmarried."

Wei Yuan shook his head with regret. "No one in this world can truly capture her beauty, not even I."

In the end, he didn’t reveal who the woman in the painting was, nor did he mention the matter of offending others again. Instead, he waved Xu Qi'an out of the Tower of Noble Spirit.

...

At the base of the Stargazing Tower, the group led by the Soul-Stealing Hand Rongrong was once again awed by the towering structure. This was the first time they stood so close to the tallest building in all of the Great Feng.

Previously, they had observed it from a distance, noting how it soared into the clouds, seemingly piercing the heavens. But seeing it up close, they truly understood its majestic grandeur. The foundation alone, rising above the ground, was as tall as a two-storey building.

Each stone block forming the foundation was larger than a carriage.

Standing before this towering structure, they were keenly aware of their own insignificance.

"Master, shall we enter?" Young Master Liu quietly swallowed, his throat dry from nervousness.

"Enter?"

The middle-aged swordsman glanced at his disciple, then shook his head. "I’ll go in alone. You all wait outside. Entering the Sitianjian is no easier than stepping into the imperial palace."

Given that they were coming with a "let’s see what happens" attitude, if anything went wrong, it would be better for him to bear the embarrassment alone. After all, if he faced disgrace by himself, it didn’t count. But if his juniors witnessed it, that would be true humiliation.

The middle-aged swordsman straightened his robes, puffed out his chest, and began ascending the long marble steps.

"Senior Hua..." Young Master Liu asked the woman beside him, "Do you think my master can acquire a new magical artefact?"

He was still unwilling to give up hope. The Seven Star Sword, which ranked highly even within the Ink Pavilion, had been destroyed. When he returned to his sect, he would surely be punished.

More importantly, there was no way he could obtain another magical artefact.

The Sitianjian was renowned across the land. Every martial artist dreamed of obtaining an artefact crafted by the Sitianjian.

The longing was so great that even knowing the odds were slim, they still indulged in such daydreams.

"Do you know why your master said the note was just the young man's attempt to save face and told you not to get your hopes up?" the woman asked, turning to the group of juniors.

Young Master Liu and the others shook their heads.

"Because Song Qing, whom your master seeks, is the Jianzheng's direct disciple. His status in the Great Feng Jianghu is comparable to that of the emperor’s sons. Do you understand now?"

They understood. It became clear that the young Silver Gong’s note was indeed just a superficial gesture. How could someone with the status of a martial prince be swayed by a mere note?

Meanwhile, the middle-aged swordsman ascended the marble steps and entered the first floor, where the ninth-grade physicians gathered.

A strong herbal scent filled the air. White-robed arcanists were busy with various tasks—some were brewing potions, others copying herb diagrams, while others sorted and categorised materials.

"Who are you?" A white-robed arcanist approached.

The middle-aged swordsman quickly lowered his head, cupped his hands, and respectfully said, "I am Yang Yuzhuo of the Ink Paviion in Jianzhou."

*Jianzhou’s Ink Paviion? Never heard of it...* The arcanist waved his hand dismissively. "Just state your business."

"I seek an audience with Master Song Qing. This note was given to me by a Silver Gong from the Nightwatchers Constabulary named Xu." The middle-aged swordsman humbly presented the note.

If Young Master Liu had seen his master at this moment, his feelings would have been conflicted. The same master who often harshly rebuked his disciples now appeared obsequious in front of a mere physician with little cultivation.

The white-robed arcanist took the note, glanced at it, and immediately adopted a serious expression. He uttered a few words—"Wait here!"—and hurried upstairs.

The middle-aged swordsman froze for a moment, surprised by the unexpected reaction.

*Wait, can this note really exchange for a magical weapon? How is that possible?*

Soon enough, the white-robed arcanist returned, holding something in his hand, answering the swordsman’s doubts perfectly.

It was a sword with a plain appearance, lacking any ornate tassels or gold inlays on the scabbard and hilt. It was simple and unadorned.

"Here!"

The arcanist handed it over, and as the swordsman fumbled to receive it, the arcanist turned and resumed his duties.

*I should leave now…* The swordsman, without inspecting the treasure, held it close and quietly exited the Sitianjian.

"Master has come out!" Young Master Liu exclaimed excitedly.

"Is that… is that really a magical weapon?" Rongrong noticed the sword held tightly by the swordsman.

Reaching his disciples, the swordsman glanced at the weapon in his arms, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Let's leave this place."

The beautiful woman nodded, her gaze never leaving the unadorned sword.

After walking for a while, distancing themselves from the towering Observation Tower, the swordsman finally stopped in a secluded spot and inspected the sword in his arms.

"Master, please, take a look..." Young Master Liu's heart raced, more excited than seeing a stunning beauty awaiting him in bed.

The swordsman grasped the hilt and slowly unsheathed the sword. A resounding _clang_ followed, and a dazzling, snow-bright gleam flooded their eyes, forcing everyone to close them reflexively.

The sword, four feet long, bore natural cloud patterns across the blade, exuding an intense cold aura. A mere touch would cause sword energy to tear open one's finger.

"Sword energy, self-generated… it’s self-generated sword energy…"

The swordsman’s hands trembled with excitement, his gaze fervent. "This is a supreme magical weapon. Even our sect master’s sword — the *Cold of Autumn Rain* is no match for this."

_Thump-thump, thump-thump…_ Young Master Liu could hear his own rapid heartbeat.

Self-generating sword energy—such a sword was considered top-tier in the Jianghu.

"Master, let me have a look, please!" Young Master Liu reached out eagerly.

Smack!

The swordsman slapped his hand away. Even he was surprised by his own reaction, as if the sword were his wife, not to be desecrated by others.

"Master, why did you hit me?" Young Master Liu asked, feeling wronged.

The swordsman thought for a moment, then said earnestly, “This sword is a top-tier magical weapon. They say a man with a treasure is guilty of his possession. This is not a good thing for you.

“I've made a difficult decision. For now, I’ll keep this sword safe for you and bear the risks. When your cultivation is advanced, I’ll return it to you.

"It’s settled. Don't say any more, your teacher’s heart is made up. To compensate you, I'll give you my cherished sword that’s been with me for twenty years. Take care of it—it’s like my wife."

"..." Young Master Liu looked at him with a deep sense of betrayal.

If Xu Qi'an were present, he’d surely feel a connection with Young Master Liu, recalling how his parents used similar reasons to confiscate countless red envelopes and allowances during his childhood, causing a deficit exceeding ten billion.

"Who exactly is this Young Master Xu?" Rongrong muttered.

No one had an answer for her. The group fell into silence, each person likely picturing the bold, handsome Silver Gong in their minds.

The beautiful middle-aged woman admired the sword, then glanced at her alluring disciple…

Suddenly, she realised that nothing happening last night might have been her greatest loss.

…

After sending off Rongrong and the other martial artists, Xu Qi'an stayed in the side hall, practicing breathing exercises, visualisation, cultivating his heart-sword, and studying the Veil of Heaven technique. Before he knew it, it was past lunch.

It was only when his stomach growled that he realised his hunger.

*Though learning more techniques benefits me greatly, I feel like there isn’t enough time…*

*I mustn’t take on any more techniques. Greed leads to inefficiency. I should focus on mastering One Blade from Heaven and Earth while supplementing it with some auxiliary skills.*

*I finally understand why emperors throughout history didn’t pursue martial arts or cultivation. There simply isn't enough time. A day has only twelve hours, and governance takes priority. Even the most talented person would become overwhelmed.*

After lunch, Zhong Li arrived.

This disciple of the Jianzheng, Chu Caiwei’s senior sister, was dressed in a coarse long robe, with her dishevelled hair hiding her face, head slightly lowered.

"I'm so glad you're unharmed." Xu Qi'an patted her on the shoulder.

"Thank you for your concern." Zhong Li replied politely.

Judging by her voice, she was likely between 20 and 25 years old. Girls under 20 had crisp, sweet voices, while those over 20 began to develop a sensual tone, characteristic of a woman’s mature charm.

"Did you face any danger yesterday?" Xu Qi'an asked.

"I encountered thirty-six crises in total: twenty minor, ten major, and six life-threatening. But I managed to survive all of them." Zhong Li recounted, her tone suggesting familiarity with the situation.

*This…* the casual way she spoke about it made Xu Qi'an feel unexpectedly sympathetic. He patted her shoulder again.

"You’ve had a hard time. Oh uh, how’s your calligraphy by the way?"

"It’s passable."

"Great, Senior Sister Zhong. I need a favour from you." Xu Qi'an smiled mischievously.
