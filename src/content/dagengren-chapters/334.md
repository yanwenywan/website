# 334. Report

*He… he actually won…* Nangong Qianrou’s expression was a mixture of complexity and disbelief, his cheeks flushing as if he'd been slapped.

*Although he relied on Confucian magic to secure victory, the fact that he defeated two fourth rank experts also means he could defeat us…* The other Gold Gongs’ feelings were equally conflicted. After spending half their lives diligently training, the thought that they might still lose to someone who had only been at the Refining Vitality stage six months ago was a heavy blow, leaving them momentarily speechless.

“We won! We won!”

Lin’an let out a small cheer. If not for maintaining the princess's dignity and decorum, she would have leapt three feet high, hopping like a jubilant little rabbit.

The coquettish young royal sister could barely contain her glee.

*During the conflict with the Buddhists, he had the Jianzheng backing him, so his victory wasn’t surprising… But this time, he used only the pure strength of a Sixth rank martial artist to defeat two Fourth rank opponents…* Huaiqing, though far less overt than Lin’an, was no less shocked.

“Didn’t you say the gap between ranks was enormous? How did he manage to win?” Beneath her veil, the Princess Consort’s sharp gaze bore into Chu Xianglong with an accusatory intensity.

Chu Xianglong’s mouth opened as if to explain, but recalling the earlier battle, he realized any argument he made would sound hollow and unconvincing.

The Princess Consort’s lips curled ever so slightly as she inwardly let out a smug hum.

Cheers erupted like a wave, with commoners unabashedly showering the young man who had walked ashore with applause and praise.

A high-ranking noble, his expression complex, sighed. “It’s been years since the capital has seen such a young man, someone so beloved by the people.”

The exuberant crowd reminded the nobility of the triumph at Shanhai Pass, when soldiers returned in glory, and the citizens of the capital lined the streets to welcome them.

Only Wei Yuan, back then at the height of his influence, could have achieved something of this magnitude.

Another noble spoke gravely, “Have you noticed how, ever since the Buddhist contest, his renown has only grown?”

“Well, that contest was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Anyone who triumphed there would see their fame soar.”

“Hmm. Just his good luck, really.”

*Big Brother actually won. And he did it using our Confucian magic…* Xu Xinnian felt a double sense of pride as he turned to glance at the still-shocked Wang family's eldest daughter. With a mix of boasting and admiration, he said, “My elder brother always accomplishes feats others deem impossible.”

*And I will strive to catch up with him...* Xu Erlang added silently to himself.

Wang Simu smiled and nodded. She appreciated Xu Erlang’s unwavering confidence. It was precisely this quality that allowed him to shine beneath his elder brother’s towering achievements without succumbing to self-pity or discouragement.

By the riverside, Xu Qi’an held Li Miaozhen in his arms. His gaze swept across the fervent crowd, the stunned martial artists, and the varied expressions on countless faces.

He gave a slight nod, then flapped his invisible wings, ascending into the sky with Li Miaozhen in his embrace.

Chu Yuanzhen watched his figure disappear into the distance. In his mind, a line of poetry echoed: 

“*If today I show my blade, who has grief unrested?*”[^1]

This was the latter half of the poem Xu Qi’an had said to him earlier, finally whispered in his year.

For a brief moment, Chu Yuanzhen felt as if struck by lightning. His entire body trembled inexplicably. Then, he released his grip on his sword and stopped fixating on the outcome of the Conflict of Heaven and Man.

“If today I show my blade, who has grief unrested?” he murmured to himself.

*For years, I’ve cultivated my sword, and when it is finally unsheathed, it shall shine with unparalleled brilliance. None shall stand in my way—neither gods nor Buddhas… I intended to make my move during the Conflict of Heaven and Man, to defeat Li Miaozhen and repay the Human Sect for bestowing upon me this sword… But I was wrong. Gravely wrong.*

*Li Miaozhen, righteous and noble, does not deserve to die by my blade. To kill such a virtuous person for my selfish desires would sow the seeds of a heart demon, haunting me for the rest of my life… Xu Ningyan was saving me all along.*

*He deliberately left the latter half of the poem unsaid back then, foreseeing today’s events… “If today I show my blade, who has grief unrested?.” This is the true essence of the intent behind my sword.*

Taking a deep breath, Chu Yuanzhen felt a surge of emotion.

He turned toward Xu Qi’an’s receding figure and bowed deeply.

“Look! Chu Yuanzhen is bowing to Silver Gong Xu out of genuine respect!”

“Silver Gong Xu truly is a peerless talent!”

The commoners cheered with uncontainable joy at the sight of Silver Gong Xu commanding respect from his opponent.

…

*Better slip away now—if I don’t, everyone will witness the backlash from the Confucian spell, and my image will be utterly ruined…* Xu Qi’an flapped his invisible wings desperately, racing back toward the capital.

As he reflected on the pros and cons of his involvement in the Conflict of Heaven and Man, he thought:

*My Vajra body has successfully reached minor accomplishment. It won’t improve further until I ascend beyond Fourth rank… But the upside is my defence now rivals, if not surpasses, that of a Fourth rank martial artist. Of course, my actual combat power is still far behind.*

*I used five pages from the ‘magic book’ gifted by the great scholars: one recorded the Daoist Golden Core, one recorded the Buddhist Commandments, two were for the Confucian Laws Follow Commandments, and one was destroyed by Li Miaozhen… The losses are significant. I need to find a chance to visit Cloud Deer Academy and mooch a bit more. I wonder how many of these treasures the scholars have in reserve…*

*Daoist Jinlian still owes me a treasure. I’ll have to collect on that debt later.*

*Intervening in the Conflict of Heaven and Man this time will be more complicated for the Human Sect, given that Luo Yuheng benefited from it. As for the Heaven Sect…*

At that thought, he glanced at Li Miaozhen, lightly patting her cheek and teasing in a low voice, “So beautiful… Why not become my concubine, huh? Haha…”

No sooner had the words left his mouth than he felt his shoulders twitch—his wings had disappeared.

Suddenly, a splitting headache overwhelmed him. His vision darkened as he plummeted from the sky.

In his final moments of consciousness, he tightened his arms around Li Miaozhen, ensuring the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect would not fall to her death.

…

Lingbao Temple.

Today, Luo Yuheng couldn’t focus on her cultivation. She alternated between fiddling with tea sets, flipping through Daoist scriptures, and standing in the courtyard, gazing at the blue sky beyond the walls.

Emperor Yuanjing tactfully refrained from seeking her out for cultivation or meditation.

The temple disciples moved with hushed steps and whispered tones, their atmosphere tense and heavy.

That was, until a figure in azure robes, carrying a sword, silently stepped into Lingbao Temple, passing through grand halls and gardens, heading toward its innermost depths.

“Chu Yuanzhen has returned?”

“The Conflict of Heaven and Man has ended… Chu Yuanzhen, did you win or lose?”

“Chu Yuanzhen, did you manage to defeat Li Miaozhen?”

The oppressive atmosphere broke as Human Sect Daoists gathered around Chu Yuanzhen, bombarding him with questions.

Chu Yuanzhen shook his head and said solemnly, “I lost.”

The cacophony of voices abruptly ceased. The Human Sect Daoists exchanged dismayed glances, their faces filled with despair.

Ignoring their dejection, Chu Yuanzhen strode toward Luo Yuheng’s courtyard. Entering, he found her standing by the pond, her figure as ethereal as a celestial.

“National Teacher,” he said with a bow.

Luo Yuheng nodded faintly. “I already know the outcome. You didn’t draw your sword, and I’m sure you had your reasons. I won’t blame you. The Human Sect relies on the dynasty’s fortune to cultivate, yet its decline is swift and unrelenting.

“This is the will of heaven, beyond anyone’s power to alter…”

*I only said I lost, but I didn’t say Li Miaozhen won… Should I clarify that the real victor was Xu Qi’an? No, she might slap me to death on the spot…* Chu Yuanzhen hesitated inwardly.

Luo Yuheng noticed his conflicted expression and consoled, “Don’t blame yourself. As I said, I don’t hold you accountable for this.”

Clearing his throat, Chu Yuanzhen replied, “National Teacher, I did lose, but Li Miaozhen didn’t win either.

“For some reason, Xu Qi’an intervened midway, forcibly disrupting the Conflict of Heaven and Man and defeating both Li Miaozhen and me.

“The Conflict of Heaven and Man… hasn’t really begun.”
