# 456. Each Side

At that moment, Huaiqing felt a loud crash in her head, as if her deepest secret had been mercilessly exposed, leaving her flustered and slightly at a loss.

*He… he knows I’m Number One? He’s known my identity all along?!*

*He’s been privately contacting me these past few days, trying again and again to meet in person, and I rejected him firmly. What was he thinking back then? He must’ve been secretly laughing… no, he probably laughed out loud…*

*Not only did he know who I am, he revealed it in front of Li Miaozhen…*

The usually elegant and aloof imperial princess’s face froze, her eyes widened slightly. For someone of her shrewdness and self-control, this was an uncharacteristically poor reaction.

Li Miaozhen’s eyes shot wide open, her small mouth agape enough to fit an egg. She truly hadn’t expected such an explosive revelation.

*Number One is Huaiqing? The princess? The eldest daughter of Emperor Yuanjing?!*

After the shock passed, Li Miaozhen recalled her usual catchphrases in the Heaven and Earth Society: “I’m going to stab Emperor Yuanjing,” “Is Emperor Yuanjing dead yet?” “When’s Emperor Yuanjing going to die?”

The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect felt her scalp prickle, goosebumps spreading over her neck, overcome with the urge to flee the room and jump down a well.

The embarrassment nearly made her want to vanish into thin air.

Huaiqing’s gaze flickered, but she quickly regained her composure and said coolly, “When did you find out, Young Master Xu of Cloud Deer Academy?”

*…Huaiqing really is a sly one! Xu Qi’an’s expression twitched slightly. He coughed once and replied without any adverse reaction:*

“Quite recently. For example, when Your Highness cleverly sent Lin’an to the Wenyuan Pavilion to borrow a book.”

As he spoke, Xu Qi’an glanced at Li Miaozhen beside him, thinking: *How wonderful. Now we can all socially die together.*

Huaiqing nodded, her expression calm. “Young Master Xu is indeed perceptive, a true man of learning. You’re no less capable than your elder brother, who once held off eight thousand rebels alone in Yunzhou.”

Xu Qi’an nodded slowly. “Too kind, too kind. Your Highness is the most brilliant of us all in the Heaven and Earth Society, using the autumn hunt painting as a pretext to stoke Lin’an’s interest in hunting, and concealing your identity flawlessly…”

Expressionless, Huaiqing said, “Young Master Xu is so brilliant. Do the others know your identity?”

“Stop- stop talking…” Li Miaozhen quietly covered her face.

Xu Qi’an and Huaiqing both fell silent, wearing stiff expressions.

*If we don’t feel embarrassed, then the embarrassment falls on someone else.*

Xu Qi’an glanced at the composed and seemingly unaffected imperial princess, thinking to himself:

*If I hadn’t seen you freeze just now, I might’ve really believed you were shameless and guiltless…*

Li Miaozhen cleared her throat, looked at the two of them, and suggested, “Let today’s events remain between the three of us. Agreed?”

“I’ve no objections,” Xu Qi’an nodded with solemn steadiness.

*Miaozhen’s a great wingwoman!*

Huaiqing nodded as well, giving Xu Qi’an a weightless glance. “Who else knows your identity?”

Xu Qi’an replied, “No one else, just the two of you.”

He automatically excluded Lina.

After another pause, Huaiqing brought the topic back on track. “Have you solved the case?”

Xu Qi’an grunted in affirmation. “Before I explain, I want to ask you both something. Your Highness, did you obtain your Earth Book fragment six years ago?”

Huaiqing paused, but didn’t deny it.

Xu Qi’an continued, “Miaozhen, your Earth Book fragment came from Daoist Jinlian when he visited the Heaven Sect, didn’t it?”

Li Miaozhen was visibly surprised. “How do you know that?”

*My deduction was correct…* Xu Qi’an exhaled and said, “I’ve indeed figured out the case. First, I must tell you this: Daoist Jinlian is the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect.”

Huaiqing and Li Miaozhen’s expressions froze instantly.

Huaiqing’s face turned solemn. Word by word, she asked gravely, “What on earth is going on?”

“The Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect fell to demons, but not completely. A fragment of his benevolent nature split off and became Daoist Jinlian. Miaozhen, you should remember that when we were protecting the lotus seed, Daoist Jinlian held off Heilian alone and entangled himself with a wisp of his demonic self,” Xu Qi’an said, looking at the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect.

Li Miaozhen frowned. “I did feel confused at the time. Even a single strand of demonic thought at second rank Overcoming Tribulation is formidable. Daoist Jinlian isn’t even third rank, how could he stand against it? It’s just…”

*Just that you couldn’t be bothered to think!* Xu Qi’an grumbled inwardly.

If Huaiqing had been there, she might’ve deduced even more. Unfortunately, she was weak, and had no cultivation.

Xu Qi’an didn’t pause, and relayed his and Luo Yuheng’s deductions to them in full. Throughout, he omitted Luo Yuheng’s role, keeping her contributions hidden.

He couldn’t reveal his private relationship with the National Teacher unless she permitted it.

As he spoke, Huaiqing’s expression shifted repeatedly, shock, anger, gloom… until it settled into a cold, unreadable stillness, as if she’d lost the ability to speak.

Li Miaozhen, meanwhile, froze like a figurine, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.

Back then, the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader seemed normal, but had already shown signs of demonic corruption. King Huai and Emperor Yuanjing encountered him in the Southern Garden, were tainted, and became seemingly normal but inwardly twisted madmen.

That’s why King Huai slaughtered a city to refine medicine for his own ambitions.

That’s why Emperor Yuanjing, despite knowing that fate-bound longevity was impossible, stubbornly defied it.

No sane person would behave like that. But if it were someone who was already half-insane?

“So, the true culprit behind it all… was Daoist Jinlian…” Li Miaozhen murmured with a sigh.

“Which is why you arranged to meet me in person instead of using the Earth Book, you were afraid Daoist Jinlian might see the message. You don’t trust him anymore,” Huaiqing said softly.

“Yes. I can’t be sure whether he knows all this. I… I don’t really trust him anymore,” Xu Qi’an replied with a sigh.

Huaiqing nodded. Anyone would feel the same, what once seemed like a trustworthy elder turns out to be the root of everything.

“Could the abnormality beneath the dragon ley be another incarnation of Daoist Jinlian?” Li Miaozhen asked.

*Damn it, I couldn’t deduce the truth at all. I’ve fallen this far behind Xu Qi’an, all because he didn’t share any clues with me…* The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect quietly comforted herself.

“I don’t know. In half a month, I’ll explore the dragon ley again. This time, I’ll have an answer,” Xu Qi’an said, without explaining why this time would be different.

Li Miaozhen and Huaiqing didn’t press him further.

“So, the soul pill is actually what that thing beneath the dragon ley needs? And the pills Father has been refining all these years, same purpose?” Huaiqing murmured.

“That’s likely the case,” Xu Qi’an said.

After a moment’s hesitation, she asked, “Can Father still… still be cleansed of the pollution?”

Xu Qi’an replied, “First we need to understand the nature of pollution. If someone’s nature has truly changed, then it’s very hard to recover. But if he’s being controlled, then Daoist Jinlian might have a solution.”

The former meant one had become corrupt to the core, making it difficult to revert. The latter, however, only required removing the control.

Li Miaozhen interjected, “No, even if one’s nature has changed, if a high monk of the Buddhist sect intervenes, they can help Yuanjing see through to his true nature and restore him.”

Huaiqing’s eyes lit up faintly.

“By the way, should we tell Lina about all this?” asked Lady Flying Swallow.

“What for?” Xu Qi’an countered.

Huaiqing said nothing, but the look in Li Miaozhen’s eyes conveyed the same thought.

“Just call her when there’s a fight. Don’t make her think. Don’t make things hard for her,” said Xu Qi’an.

*Good point!* Li Miaozhen slowly nodded.

They agreed to wait half a month for developments, and Xu Qi’an saw Huaiqing off from the residence.

Before leaving, Huaiqing lowered her voice and said, “If the full truth is revealed half a month from now, you won’t have to leave the capital.”

The officials and the Jianzheng would surely do all they could to resolve the emperor’s half-mad condition.

*Can’t bear to part with me, can you…* Xu Qi’an smiled but didn’t reply.

After a brief pause, Huaiqing added, “In the meantime, I’ll review all the clues again. If I find anything, I’ll inform you.”

With that, she boarded the carriage and left the street.

…

Atop the crumbling city wall, within the walled city.

The high-ranking generals of the Great Feng had gathered, engaged in heated argument.

Wei Yuan ignored them all, standing silently before the geomantic map, deep in thought.

It had been ten days since Dingguan City fell. Under Wei Yuan’s command, the army had swept through cities like a sharp blade plunging into the Yan Kingdom’s heartland.

They had already taken seven cities, advanced hundreds of li, and now stood in Xu City[^1], the final bastion before the Yan capital.

One step away from the Yan capital. In just ten days, Wei Yuan had routed a nation known for its countless fortified passes.

Now, whether to strike at the Yan capital or not had split the generals severely.

The Great Feng army was in dire straits, short on rations.

“Why hasn’t the supply convoy arrived? According to our deployment, the first shipment should’ve come three days ago. We can’t keep fighting. The front’s stretched too thin. Our supply line’s been cut. No food, no cannonballs, no bolts, how are we supposed to fight?”

A young general stood up, face grim, and said, “From Dingguan City to Xu City, we’ve lost over half our troops. And the Yan capital is flanked by mountains. With our current forces, it’s impossible to take. Unless I’m mistaken, there’s a Third Rank warlock stationed in their capital.”

This young general was Zhao Ying, born of the Imperial Guard and a Fourth Rank expert, one of the leading younger generation officers of Great Feng.

He advocated retreat and led the conservative faction.

The radical faction was headed by Nangong Qianrou, who wanted to push forward and capture Yan.

“Sixty li northeast lies the Yan capital. After taking Xu City, we’ll have supplies and ammunition to sustain one more campaign,” Nangong Qianrou said calmly.

“Our success so far came from the principle of lightning war. If we retreat now, we give Yan a chance to recover. But if we take the capital, we’ll replenish both arms and grain.”

This stunning advance was all thanks to his adoptive father’s bold, swift strategy, which had shattered the Yan army’s morale. With momentum on their side, the Great Feng troops were in high spirits and should strike while the iron was hot.

If they retreated, this aura of invincibility would fade. Facing the heavily fortified Yan capital and reinforcements from Kang, victory would become far more difficult.

Zhao Ying glared at Nangong Qianrou and said in a deep voice:

“Lightning war doesn’t work on the Yan capital. It’s flanked by mountains, easy to defend, hard to assault. Their flying beast cavalry are stationed in the hills, nothing like what we’ve faced before. Also, we’ve razed seven cities. Civilians, martial artists, and scattered Yan troops are all fleeing to the capital.

“If the city falls, they must all die, that’s their understanding. So they’ll unite and defend it to the death. We don’t have the strength to breach it. If our forces take heavy losses during the assault, it opens the door for a counterattack, we could be wiped out.”

“Better to retreat for now, recover, replenish our stores, and then strike again.”

The Yan capital was well-defended. Most of the generals present lacked confidence. The conservative faction clearly outnumbered the radicals.

The only reason the debate continued was that they still held out hope for Wei Yuan’s decision.

“Rest for one night. Tomorrow we move. Lay siege to the capital,” said Wei Yuan, pointing to the Yan capital on the map.

The arguments ceased.

…

Sixty li away, the capital of the Yan Kingdom was built within a vast mountain valley. Towering city walls, three thousand feet in length, spanned between two peaks.

The mountains were steep and perilous, the walls lofty and imposing. Equipped with cannons, ballistae, and rolling stones, the city's defences could be described as impregnable. Any military strategist who laid eyes on this formidable city would be struck with awe.

Throughout its fourteen-hundred-year history since the founding of the Yan Kingdom, the city had only ever fallen once, during the peak of the Great Zhou dynasty, when a prince of the imperial family, a Rank two martial artist, led an army into the Yan Capital.

Yan historical records note that the battle was fierce. The Church of the Warlock God lost a Master of Rain (second rank) and a Master of Wisdom (third rank). In the end, the Warlock God himself intervened and killed the peak Rank two prince.

This was not because Yan Capital’s defences were inadequate, but because the enemy's power stood atop the Nine Provinces.

In the royal palace of the capital, the Yan King Nurhaci, though his hair had turned grey, still maintained a robust physique. He had displayed exceptional talent from a young age, first following the path of the martial artist, reaching peak rank four, before hitting a bottleneck.

Afterward, he shifted to the warlock system and reached rank four again, but once more could not advance.

Dual system cultivation was extremely rare, not due to conflict between the systems, but due to the sheer difficulty. One had to commit to a single path to reach greater heights.

Now past fifty, Nurhaci had no hope of reaching rank three in either system. But he wasn’t disheartened. rank three experts were as rare as phoenix feathers; failing to reach it was normal. Besides, his dual cultivation meant his individual combat strength surpassed any rank four of a single system.

Sitting on the throne, he listened to his ministers’ heated debate.

The upper echelons of Yan were neither disheartened nor furious at Wei Yuan’s overwhelming advance, they had long since mentally prepared for a crushing defeat.

“Wei Yuan has already taken Xu City. He’ll be at our gates by tomorrow.”

“How did he manage to break seven cities in just ten days?”

“Can the capital hold?”

The hall was tense. The faces of the Yan ministers were grim, as if facing a mortal enemy.

Some of the older ministers felt as if they were back at the Battle of Shanhai Pass, recalling the fear and humiliation wrought by Wei Yuan.

“According to reports from the escort scouts, the Feng army has no more than fifty thousand men left. No matter how godlike Wei Yuan’s command may be, taking the capital with fifty thousand is near impossible.”

“The entire city stands united. The garrison is strong, supplies are ample. At worst, we’ll fight to the death with the Eunuch Wei.”

“…”

Nurhaci couldn’t help turning to an old man wrapped in a fur robe, hooded and holding a jewelled golden staff. With respectful tone, he asked, “National Teacher Irbu, what is your view?”

In the northeast, each of the three kingdoms had a rank three Master of Wisdom as their National Teacher. Normally they didn’t intervene in politics, but their status surpassed even kings, for they represented the Central Altar, and the Church of the Warlock God.

Irbu, who had narrowly escaped death in Chuzhou, gripped his golden staff and said in a deep voice, “The fifty-thousand-strong Kang army has entered Yan territory. In at most five days, we will complete the encirclement.”

Nurhaci nodded thoughtfully. “The Capital has stood for over a thousand years, weathering many wars, and has only ever fallen once. Wei Yuan cannot breach the city in a short time. But time is now critical for the Feng army, they are short on provisions.”

The ministers nodded slowly.

“If the Kang army merely cuts off their supply line, we need only hold the city. In three days, Wei Yuan will have no choice but to retreat.”

“This battle, we’ll see how Wei Yuan plans to fight it.”

Irbu gazed through the palace doors at the azure sky.

*Seven cities slaughtered, draining our Church’s fortune, and now you point your sword at the Warlock God himself... Wei Yuan, you think yourself unparalleled in wisdom, that last year’s meticulous deployment was flawless. Hah. Little do you know, this is exactly what we’ve been waiting for.*

*To dream of reaching the Central Altar with less than a hundred thousand troops, utter foolishness.*

…

On the ruined city wall, Wei Yuan stood wrapped in an azure cloak, gazing down. Great Feng soldiers were pushing flatbed carts, throwing bodies into a deep pit, onto torches.

Thick smoke rose, laced with the stench of burning flesh.

Cast into the flames were not only Yan soldiers and civilians, but also the Great Feng’s own fallen.

In just ten days, the Great Feng army had lost over thirty thousand soldiers and officers.

The soldiers moved in silence. Days of war, tempered in blood and fire, had left them quiet. Their fierce spirit lay hidden in that silence.

Nangong Qianrou stepped up behind Wei Yuan and said softly, “Father, after this campaign, you’ll be condemned in the histories.”

Seven cities butchered, hundreds of li dyed red with blood. In his eyes, the mass execution of surrendered soldiers was understandable; the Great Feng’s forces were deep in enemy territory, a lone army. If they didn’t kill the captives, they would become a burden.

They’d have to guard against rebellion, and feed extra mouths, depleting their supplies.

But killing civilians violated all military doctrine. To slaughter seven cities, even a victorious return would earn them only censure from the moralists.

Since setting out, not once had supplies come from the Great Feng’s side. Everything, food, weapons, provisions, had been seized from Yan through pillage and plunder.

This was no good omen.

The younger generation of generals had assumed it was Wei Yuan’s unique command style, thrilled by the successive victories. But now, even they were beginning to sense something was wrong.

Hence, the calls to retreat.

If the younger generation were thinking this way, how much more so for veterans like Nangong Qianrou, who had followed Wei Yuan for a decade or two.

“There will be no more provisions.”

Wei Yuan’s smile was as warm as ever, his tone as calm as always. “What we brought is all we have. Not another grain will come from the capital.”

“Who would dare cut off supplies?” Nangong Qianrou radiated murderous intent.

“In all of the Great Feng, who do you think?” Wei Yuan replied with a smile.

His pupils contracted sharply.

“I know you want to seize the Yan Capital in one push, then occupy this natural stronghold to resist Kang’s reinforcements, linking up with the three provinces to surround them. But alas, the Yan Capital is a tough bone to chew. We can’t bite through. I’ve already redeployed all the troops from the three provinces elsewhere.”

Unchanging in expression, Wei Yuan gazed at the roaring flames devouring the heaps of corpses and said flatly, “Tomorrow, the army advances fifty li. We’ll face the Yan Capital for three days. After that, you take ten thousand heavy cavalry and leave. Don’t worry about the others, they must stay.”

As he spoke, he drew two silk sachets from his robe, one purple, one red.

“Three days from now, open the purple one, it will tell you where to go. Once you arrive, open the red one, it will tell you what to do next.”

…

In the glow of the setting sun, Xu Xinnian was directing soldiers to burn corpses and dissect warhorses. They had just won a small-scale battle.

They had completely annihilated eight hundred of the enemy at the cost of a thousand of their own, already a rather pleasing victory.

Several days had passed since the ambush that night; the large-scale attack had scattered the allied forces of the Yao, barbarians, and the Great Feng.

The Jing army had responded quickly, splitting its forces to give chase.

In the days that followed, Xu Xinnian gained a deeper understanding of the brutality of war, witnessed the bravery of the Fire Armour Cavalry, and saw for himself the eerie horror of sorcerers awakening corpses to turn them into undead soldiers.

With heavy cavalry and corpse-controlling sorcerers on the field, the Great Feng’s army was essentially throwing lives into a pit to buy victory.

When the alliance was scattered, Xu Xinnian and Chu Yuanzhen had only six hundred the Great Feng soldiers with them. In the days since, they had gathered remnants along the way, swelling their numbers to one thousand seven hundred.

Now, only seven hundred remained.

After burning the corpses, Xu Xinnian ordered scouts on patrol, then had the soldiers set up pots to cook horse meat.

The men skilfully sliced the horse meat. Then, working together, they swung their sabres, still stained from killing, and hacked the meat into a fine mush before tossing it into the pot to stew.

It was Xu Xinnian’s idea. Horse meat was coarse, tough, and hard to digest. You could stomach it once in a while, but after several days of it, the soldiers’ guts gave out.

They couldn’t even shit.

So Xu Xinnian proposed mincing the meat and cooking it until it fell apart to improve taste and aid digestion.

“If not for Brother Chu, we’d have had to lose a few hundred more men to take out this group.”

Xu Xinnian walked over to Chu Yuanzhen, removed his water flask, and handed it over.

Chu Yuanzhen drank half of it in one go, then gave a slightly forlorn smile.

“When I was young, I read a few military texts and fancied myself a prodigy in warfare. Only now, on the battlefield, do I realise I wasn’t made for this. You, though, your growth has been rapid. Just look at these soldiers, who among them doesn’t respect you?”

Xu Xinnian smiled. “Everyone has their strengths. If I weren’t talented in this, my teacher wouldn’t have pushed me to specialise in military strategy. What I’ve come to understand is that on the battlefield, strategy only plays a small part. Most of the time, it comes down to brute strength. Martial prowess and military equipment are vital. Pity we only brought out three cannons and six ballistae.”

*Before going to war, the old Xu Erlang would have raised his chin proudly and then made a show of humility…* Chu Yuanzhen sighed again.

Just then, a scout rode up fast and shouted, “Commissioner Xu, we’ve spotted a group of thirty scattered troops!”

No horn was sounded, meaning they were the Great Feng’s own.

Xu Xinnian and Chu Yuanzhen stood up. The former thought for a moment and said, “Let them come over.”

Then he turned to Chu Yuanzhen and gave a wry smile. “At least it’s not too many, our rations can still hold out.”

Soon after, the scout led a ragged group of thirty soldiers to them. They had brought a cannon and over a dozen shells.

Their faces were worn, covered in dust, their armour damaged and scratched. Every man bore wounds.

They looked like they had only just come out of battle.

Smelling the fragrant broth from the boiling pot, the infantrymen gulped.

Xu Xinnian stepped forward and asked, “Who here holds the highest rank? Step forward and speak.”

A burly, bearded man came up, around forty years old. He cupped his fists and said, “This officer is Zhao Panyi, Baihu captain of the Yongzhou Xi county garrison.”

Xu Xinnian nodded. “I am Xu Xinnian, Assistant Surveillance Commissioner of Dingzhou, and Hanlin Academy Bachelor.”

Upon hearing that, Zhao Panyi’s face darkened. He gave Xu Xinnian a fierce glare, snorted, and turned to leave.

Xu Xinnian was taken aback. A flash of confusion crossed his face. He frowned. “Baihu Zhao, wait. Do we know each other?”

“No we don’t!” Zhao Panyi’s voice was surly.

*We don’t? I thought I stole your wife without knowing it…* Xu Xinnian cursed inwardly and frowned more deeply.

“If we don’t know each other, then why the attitude, Baihu Zhao?”

“You do speak like a scholar, I’ll give you that. That bastard Xu Pingzhi actually raised a bookworm. I heard the Silver Gong’s cousin was in the army, never thought I’d run into you today.” Zhao Panyi sneered.

“I don’t know you, but I know your father. Back during the Battle of Shanhai Pass, we were brothers.”

*That’s your idea of brotherhood?* Xu Erlang was stunned.

“You have some old grudge with my father?”

“No grudge. Just can’t stand how ungrateful he is.”

Zhao Panyi spat and said:

“Back at Shanhai Pass, your father Xu Pingzhi and I were in the same unit. There was another man with us, Zhou Biao. The three of us were close as brothers, the kind you could trust with your back.

“Near the end of the battle, we were sent to intercept the corpse soldiers of the Church of the Warlock God. During the fight, Zhou Biao took a blow for your father and died on the field. Xu Pingzhi swore then and there he’d bring Zhou Biao’s old mother to the capital to care for her, and raise his two children to adulthood.

“Damn it, I only learned later that the ungrateful bastard never even went to Zhou Biao’s hometown. If the father’s a bastard, what kind of man could the son be? You’re all rotten. I, Zhao Panyi, would rather starve or die on the battlefield than eat your food or drink your soup. Bah!”
