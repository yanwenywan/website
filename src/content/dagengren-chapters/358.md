# 358. Sanhuang County

【TWO: I’ve been investigating the "Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles" case, thinking that such a major event couldn’t possibly be concealed. But Xu Qi’an, let me tell you, this case is incredibly strange.

【I flew along the border of Chuzhou for three days and nights but haven’t located the site of the supposed massacre. However, I did notice something odd. I encountered a small band of barbarian cavalry, killed them, and summoned their souls for questioning. They had no knowledge of the “Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles” incident.】

Li Miaozhen had directly flown north on her flying sword, arriving far faster than Xu Qi’an—like comparing taking a flight to a cruise and road trip.

Xu Qi’an typed a reply: 【I already know about this. The case isn’t as simple as it seems.】

*Furthermore, “Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles” is an idiom, not a literal description of slaughter. Sister, could you read more books for once…* he thought with mild exasperation.

Li Miaozhen was astonished: 【What? You already knew? Truly impressive.】

*It’s not as godlike as you imagine—I did the same as you: killed and summoned souls. The only difference is you dealt with a small cavalry squad, and I interrogated a barbarian leader…* Xu Qi’an continued: 【Have you discovered anything else?】

Li Miaozhen replied: 【I did notice something peculiar. In Chuzhou, goods are incredibly cheap—whether it’s lodging, meals, or other purchases. Five taels of silver go a long way. In contrast, in the capital, five taels vanish in an instant.】

*What are you even talking about…* Xu Qi’an was baffled, taking a few seconds to realize she was essentially saying: “The steamed buns here are dirt cheap.”

*So, what’s your point? Are you marvelling at the affordability of Chuzhou or venting your shopping frustrations as a woman?*

Xu Qi’an frowned and wrote: 【Miaozhen, I don’t quite understand your meaning.】

Li Miaozhen clarified: 【Usually, when a region experiences war, the prices of essentials like grain skyrocket. But I checked the grain prices across several counties in Chuzhou. Although there are fluctuations, they aren’t significant.】

Xu Qi’an understood now. She meant that Chuzhou’s market stability indicated that the barbarian incursions, while destructive at the borders, affected only a small portion of the vast province of Chuzhou, which spanned eight thousand li.

【THREE: No cities were occupied?】

【TWO: I haven’t seen any. Besides, if border cities were taken, the barbarians wouldn’t just pillage the fringes without daring to penetrate deeper into Chuzhou.】

*Not taking cities while only raiding the borderlands—this must be fear of encirclement. I see now why ancient wars always involved sieging cities. Without securing them, bypassing would leave your flanks exposed,* Xu Qi’an thought.

When he was younger and watched historical dramas, he used to think ancient generals were foolish for fixating on besieging cities instead of bypassing them to attack the next target—or even the capital.

*Ah, the simplicity of a child’s world…* he mused, as Li Miaozhen sent another message: 【Xu Qi’an, I’m starting to doubt whether the "Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles" case is even real. I don’t know how to proceed with the investigation.】

Even through the Earth Book fragments, Xu Qi’an could sense Li Miaozhen’s frustration and helplessness.

She had reached out privately to Xu Qi’an precisely to seek his advice on how to proceed with the investigation.

Her doubts weren’t unwarranted. The “Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles” case originated from a remnant soul—a nameless and mysterious entity.

Now that he thought about it, the decisions by Duke Wei, the court officials, and Emperor Yuanjing seemed somewhat hasty.

The case clearly warranted investigation, but sending an entire delegation? It seemed exaggerated. A more prudent approach would have been to dispatch a smaller group or covert spies for preliminary inquiries.

But if the "Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles" case was fabricated, how would one explain the remnant soul?

The deceased was someone Li Miaozhen happened upon by chance. If not for her Taoist skills in summoning souls, the soul would have dissipated within days.

This meant it was unlikely to be a deliberate setup.

The deceased had journeyed from the north to the capital to raise a royal complaint about the "Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles" case, only to be intercepted and killed eighty miles from the capital.

*Honestly, I have no fuckin’ clue either… Would admitting that ruin the image of my towering genius in Li Miaozhen’s mind?*

After pondering for a while, Xu Qi’an wrote: 【Miaozhen, the corpse you found on the roadside—he was a jianghu wanderer, correct?】

【TWO: Yes, that’s something you deduced.】

【THREE: Have you considered this—if such a major incident occurred in the northern region, who would be the first to impeach the Zhenbei King?】

【TWO: Naturally, the local officials from the affected areas.】

【THREE: Correct. So, why did you discover the body of a jianghu wanderer instead of an official?】

Li Miaozhen’s experience allowed her to grasp his implication quickly. She replied: 【It’s not unusual for righteous men of the jianghu to bear witness to atrocities and, outraged, journey to the capital to seek justice.】

Xu Qi’an smirked and sent: 【If that were the case, he wouldn’t have been intercepted. No one would pay attention to a mere wanderer. Even if he reached the capital, he wouldn’t have the means to lodge a formal complaint.

【I won’t delve into the bureaucratic hurdles of filing such a case. Suffice it to say, without evidence, a commoner accusing a king would be ignored by the court.】

He paused, doubts resurfacing in his mind. Was the imperial court’s decision to dispatch the delegation—by Duke Wei, the officials, or Emperor Yuanjing—really a tad too hasty?

Li Miaozhen caught on swiftly and wrote: 【So you’re saying that local officials may have submitted memorials impeaching the Zhenbei King but encountered misfortune, prompting them to send the wanderer with a token to the capital, which led to his murder.】

Her analysis sharpened. The clarity from Xu Qi’an’s hints invigorated her investigative mindset.

*Actually, I’ve had some thoughts of my own, but they only linked together after his prodding…* Li Miaozhen thought to herself, then instinctively sent a message through the book:

【What should I do next?】

As soon as she sent it, she regretted it. _Li Miaozhen, oh Li Miaozhen, you're showing too much dependence. You look like a helpless woman who needs his support!_

She reflected angrily while staring intently at the mirrored surface.

【THREE: Simple. Conceal your identity as the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect and act under the guise of Lady Flying Swallow in the Jianghu of Chuzhou. It’s best to perform some acts of chivalry along the way.】

Li Miaozhen’s heart stirred. 【Are you suggesting…】

Xu Qi’an replied: 【We’ve been overlooking the people behind that “dead man by the roadside.” The person they were working for must have encountered trouble and sent a Jianghu messenger as a result. If that person is still alive, they’re likely hiding somewhere, waiting for news.

【They probably wouldn’t approach the delegation. Heh, the delegation is likely under constant surveillance as soon as they enter the Northern Territories. King Huai’s clique might even be using the delegation as bait. Instead of approaching the delegation, this individual is more likely to seek out reputable Jianghu heroes, as evidenced by the fallen messenger.

【Of course, this hinges on the premise that the person seeking to appeal for justice is still alive.】

_Why didn’t I think of this? Truly, no one compares to you!_ Li Miaozhen’s eyes sparkled as she sent a message: 【I understand. Once I have clues, I’ll contact you again.】

Xu Qi’an immediately replied: 【Aight. I have another question. When someone loses their sanity before death and their soul becomes incoherent, how long would it take for them to recover after being summoned?】

There was a pause of several seconds before Li Miaozhen responded: 【Is the soul intact?】

Xu Qi’an replied: 【The three souls are intact.】

He had carried the corpse away that day precisely to allow the white-robed arcanist’s soul to reassemble after seven days. After this period, the human soul would flow from the corpse and merge with the scattered heaven and earth souls.

At that point, the soul would emerge from its muddled state and return to its original clarity.

Li Miaozhen responded: 【In that case, it’s manageable. Two or three days should suffice.】

【THREE: That’s not urgent. We’ll handle it once we reunite.】

Ending the communication, Xu Qi’an finished the lukewarm porridge, stashed the fragment of the Earth Book securely, and stepped out of the cave.

“I’ve finished eating.”

The princess consort, who had secretly discarded the roasted pheasant, called out loudly.

Xu Qi’an responded with a simple “Mm,” pretending not to notice her actions, and walked alongside her on the mountain path.

Green trees shaded the way, birds chirped, and flowers exuded their fragrance. Apart from the occasional rustling in the grass that startled the princess consort, she seemed to enjoy the closeness to nature.

_Who exactly is this princess consort? She has spiritual resonance in her body… Is she the Great Feng equivalent of Xuanzang meat?[^1] Heh, in that case, I must be Sun Wukong._

_Master, eat Old Sun’s staff!_

*Hehehe…* The thought made Xu Qi’an smirk involuntarily.

As they neared Sanhuang County, villages began to appear more frequently. Xu Qi’an and the princess consort took their noon meal at a farmer’s home—one bowl of porridge each and a side of pickled vegetables.

The household had five members: two elderly parents, a couple, and a child.

They lived in a mud-brick house, their clothes mended with patches. The elderly were gaunt, and the child’s face was sallow.

Seated in the courtyard, Xu Qi’an overheard a child’s voice from inside the house:

“Mum, I’m so hungry.”

“Haven’t you eaten already?” the mother replied softly.

“But there used to be a full bowl. Why is there only half today?” the child asked, aggrieved.

“Because we have guests today. Missing one meal won’t starve you,” the father scolded.

The child, frightened by his father, lowered his head and said nothing further.

“The people of the Northern Territories sure are hospitable…”

The princess consort whispered, “Look at their home. They’re practically destitute. I guess they survive on porridge for every meal and can’t afford white rice.”

_After spending so much time in the capital, I nearly forgot what true hardship looks like..._ Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly but replied:

“That’s normal. Did you expect them to feast on meat and fish every day? Being able to fill their stomachs is already a luxury.”

The princess consort pursed her lips and asked softly, “Do you have any silver on you?”

_Of course I do. All my wealth is stored in the Earth Book fragment…_ Xu Qi’an understood her intention and asked, “Are you asking to borrow silver?”

She nodded.

“How much?”

The princess consort hesitated before saying, “A hundred taels, not too much—it might expose our identity.”

… Xu Qi’an’s expression froze as he enunciated, “How much?”

“Too much? Then… fifty taels?” She blinked her beautiful eyes.

_You, you…_ Xu Qi’an mentally smacked her, then said in a firm tone, “One cash of silver, no more.”

*Shouldn’t a favoir be returned tenfold? Why are you so stingy?* The princess consort looked at him in surprise, her brows furrowing.

Xu Qi’an sighed, “Given our current guise, even one cash of silver is generous. Any more would raise suspicion. If the Zhenbei King’s men or spies in the Northern Territories investigate this place and ask around, we’ll be exposed.”

One cash of silver, though modest, would be enough for this impoverished family to afford some decent food for a few days.

The princess consort nodded, accepting Xu Qi’an’s reasoning. She respected Xu Ningyan’s meticulous thought process.

Then, with a pleased expression, she said, “Once we reach Sanhuang County, I’m taking a bath. I can’t stand my own stench anymore.”

Xu Qi’an ignored her, seated on a small stool in the courtyard, gazing at the blue sky. He muttered wistfully, “After a meal, I could use some yogurt.”

…

He noisily slurped down the last of the porridge, then called the man of the house over. “Thank you. I’ve come... into the city to visit relatives and didn’t bring much with me...”

Xu Qi’an took out a small piece of silver and handed it to the man. “Just a little token of gratitude.”

“This... this...” The man was stunned. He had seen copper coins before, but silver was a rare sight for him.

The two had a brief back-and-forth, with Xu Qi’an earnestly reasoning as he insisted. Standing nearby, the princess consort watched him solemnly debate with the man, and for some reason, she felt a subtle joy in her heart, her lips curving into a slight smile.

A man with human decency, even if he was a bit lecherous, was far better than those heartless, scheming, and bloodthirsty big shots.

After the two left, the man returned inside with the small silver piece cradled in his hands, his face glowing with excitement as he presented it to his family like a treasure.

“They... they left us silver!” the man exclaimed.

The elderly grandfather extended a trembling hand to pat the child's head. “Tomorrow, your father will buy you some meat to eat.”

The members of the impoverished family beamed with heartfelt gratitude and joy.

...

“Why didn’t you introduce my identity just now?”

As they walked along the main road, the princess consort suddenly spoke, fuming.

“What?” Xu Qi’an didn’t catch on immediately.

The princess consort stomped her feet, catching up to him, and glared. “You said we were heading into the city to visit relatives, but you didn’t mention me at all. Hmph!”

Xu Qi’an remembered and indeed realized he had done so. He retorted, “And how exactly should I have introduced you? If I said you were my wife, someone as stunning as you doesn’t match my dashing face. If I said you were my elder sister, it’d seem far-fetched—you don’t look remotely like me. And as a servant girl? In our current disheveled state, it wouldn’t fit.”

“Then just say I’m your grandaunt!” the princess consort said, placing her hands on her hips.

“Get lost! Why don’t you just say you’re my great-grandmother?” Xu Qi’an snapped back irritably.

...

By dusk, they arrived at Sanhuang County. However, instead of entering immediately, they stopped at a tea stand outside the city to drink a cup of cool tea.

Sanhuang County marked their official entry into the Northern Marches.

Once in Sanhuang County, Xu Qi’an would be able to contact the Nightwatchers’ informants to gather intelligence.

The county seat of Sanhuang County was small, with a population of less than ten thousand. At the city gates, the guards stopped them, demanding to see official travel permits.

The princess consort immediately grew anxious, shrinking back. She knew she had no travel permits and would not withstand an investigation.

*What should I do? We can’t enter the city...* Her heart clenched with worry, knowing this meant continued trekking and that Xu Qi’an would be hindered in his investigation. For a moment, she felt utterly hopeless.

“We have them, we have them.”

Xu Qi’an flashed a broad smile and respectfully handed over an official permit.

The guard took a glance, then returned the permit to Xu Qi’an. “Go ahead.”

The princess consort followed behind Xu Qi’an with her head down and small, quick steps. Once they had passed the city gate and left it behind, she exhaled deeply in relief and asked, “Where did you get a travel permit?”

“Nicked it. When you were asleep, I went out and played the part of a bandit for a bit,” Xu Qi’an replied coolly.

*Well done...* The princess consort’s eyes curved in amusement. Then she heard Xu Qi’an sigh. “The situation doesn’t look good. Your husband’s people already know I’ve headed north alone.”

“?”

The princess consort blinked, a question mark flashing in her mind. Impossible. They had travelled discreetly, without revealing a trace. How could the King Huai’s men know Xu Ningyan was traveling north?

Moreover, how did Xu Qi’an figure this out?

As sharp as she was, she couldn’t detect any clues.

“But fortunately, they don’t know you’re with me,” Xu Qi’an added.

“... What do you mean?” the princess consort asked, pursing her lips and tilting her head to gaze at him with earnest curiosity.

She had always enjoyed listening to Xu Qi’an recount his investigative exploits and was endlessly fascinated by them. Hearing about his clever deductions left her applauding in admiration—though she would never admit that to Xu Qi’an.
