# 391. Summons

Xu Qi’an was an open-minded person. He wouldn’t dwell on minor annoyances. Since his little sister was an uncarvable block of wood, he decided not to bother carving her.

Dragging her to the academy and letting the teachers discipline her with a wooden rod would be far more effective—why waste his breath?

But before he could act, Li Miaozhen stopped him. The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect frowned in disapproval. “If you have something to say, just say it properly. Why resort to violence against a child?”

_Holy Maiden, you’ll never understand the suffering of parents raising a little tyrant…_ Xu Qi’an decided to give her some face and abandoned his plan, heading into the courtyard instead.

Inside, only a mother and daughter were present. Xu Lingyue, delicate and refined, sat on a small wooden stool, focused on her embroidery.

The stool could barely contain her increasingly full figure. Her round hips spilled slightly over the edges, their firm shape accentuated by the fabric of her dress.

Meanwhile, Auntie had abandoned all pretence of propriety. She had knotted her light green skirt just above her calves and was squatting in the flowerbed, busying herself with a small trowel and pruning shears, tending to the plants.

Aside from disciplining Xu Lingyin, gardening was one of Auntie’s only hobbies.

Her maid, Lyu'e, knelt beside her, assisting.

“Big Brother!”

Upon seeing Xu Qi’an return, Lingyue beamed with joy, setting aside her embroidery to greet him, her smile as radiant as a blooming flower.

Her gaze, however, subtly flickered over Li Miaozhen, Susu, and Zhong Li.

That little look, filled with scrutiny, was enough to reveal the natural, instinctive hostility that existed between beautiful women.

“It’s over now. You can go home today,” Xu Qi’an said, pinching the tip of her smooth, round nose before glancing toward the house. “Where’s Erlang? And Second Uncle?”

“Father went off somewhere to train. Second Brother is studying with Master Zhang,” Lingyue replied in her soft, youthful voice.

Xu Qi’an nodded, just about to speak when Lingyue, filled with curiosity, softly asked, “Big Brother, who is that sister?”

She was referring to Zhong Li.

Though Zhong Li had followed Xu Qi’an for a long time, she had never officially revealed herself. This was the first time Lingyue had seen her.

“She’s Caiwei’s senior sister,” Xu Qi’an explained.

_Oh, the senior sister of that gluttonous girl…_ Lingyue suddenly understood.

She had given Chu Caiwei a nickname—Glutton Number One. Lina was Glutton Number Two, and Xu Lingyin was Glutton Number Three.

In fact, anyone familiar with those three would have similar nicknames in mind. For instance, inside the courtyard, a certain woman had just noticed that her youngest daughter was once again covered in dirt. Furious, she grabbed a bamboo switch and chased her out of the door.

Auntie had her own names for Lina and Xu Lingyin: Stupid Girl and Stupid Child, Greedy Girl and Greedy Child, Both Stupid and Gluttonous Girl and Child… and other variations on that theme.

“You little brat, do you think washing your clothes every day isn’t tiring for me?! You don’t even care for your mother at all.” Auntie’s angry voice rang out: “Then I’ll beat you like you’re not my daughter!”

“Then I’m not your daughter, why are you hitting me?” Xu Lingyin retorted.

Auntie choked, unable to respond, before flying into a rage. “How dare you talk back?!”

…

Xu Qi’an led Zhong Li out of the small courtyard, weaving through the various houses and courtyards, following the stone-paved path. Occasionally, they ascended stone steps. After about the time it took to burn a stick of incense, they arrived at a valley filled with bamboo groves.

Bamboo was far more common in the South. Although the Great Feng claimed to be the rightful ruler of Jiuzhou, overlord of the central plains, its capital lay in the northern-central region, where the climate was not suitable for bamboo growth.

This made the bamboo grove on Qingyun Mountain quite a rare sight.

It was early summer, and the bamboo stood lush and green. The wind rustled through the leaves, creating a soothing, whispering sound. The scenery was picturesque and serene.

Meanwhile, Xu Qi’an’s thoughts were on something entirely different. _How do you make bamboo wine again?_

A small pavilion was nestled within the grove, like the secluded retreat of a hermit. A stone pathway paved with smooth pebbles led to the pavilion, its surface scattered with fallen bamboo leaves.

Xu Qi’an stopped in front of it and cupped his hands in salute. “Dean, Xu Qi’an requests an audience!”

A flash of light engulfed him, and in the next instant, he was transported inside the pavilion.

Zhao Shou sat at his desk, sipping tea. He looked at Xu Qi’an with a knowing smile but said nothing.

His old Confucian robe had been washed so often it had faded. His slightly unkempt hair was streaked with white, and his entire being radiated a sense of “cynical disillusionment”.

Among all the high-ranked experts Xu Qi’an had met, Zhao Shou was by far the most unrefined. The Jianzheng was always dressed in immaculate white robes, exuding an immortal-like air. Master Du’e of the Buddhist sect wore a resplendent kasaya embroidered with gold thread, his presence calm and detached, the very image of an enlightened monk.

By contrast, Dean Zhao gave off the aura of Kong Yiji or Fan Jin…

_"Hmm, I almost forgot about Daoist Jinlian. He also looks like a wandering Daoist, always appearing rather destitute…"_ Xu Qi’an added in his mind.

“Many thanks to the Dean for assisting me,” he said, expressing his gratitude.

“To ordain conscience for Heaven and Earth, To secure life and fortune for the people, To continue lost teachings for past sages, To establish peace for all future generations… Those were your words to me, and you have not forgotten them,” Zhao Shou said with a smile.

_So long as I haven’t strayed from my ideals, we’re still on good terms, is that what you mean?_ Xu Qi’an chuckled and returned the gesture before making his request.

“I have come to the academy to borrow a book from the Dean.”

Zhao Shou studied him for a moment before nodding slightly.

“The Collected Records of the Great Zhou.”

Xu Qi’an remembered that Wei Yuan had told him that if he wanted to uncover the princess consort’s secret, he needed to borrow this book from Cloud Deer Academy.

“Hah!”

Zhao Shou let out a chuckle. “This book was written six hundred years ago by a great scholar of our academy. He was born at the end of the Great Zhou and was active in the early days of Great Feng. He compiled everything he saw and experienced regarding the Great Zhou into this book. There is only one copy in the world—it was never printed or published. Very few have ever read it.”

_No wonder even Huaiqing hadn’t heard of it. No matter how much of an academic she is, she wouldn’t have read every book in existence. Scholars always read with a purpose, focusing on books relevant to their interests._

Xu Qi’an came to a realisation.

Zhao Shou continued with a faint smile, “You must have heard of that great scholar. His deeds were recorded on a stone stele here in the academy.”

A sudden realisation dawned on Xu Qi’an, and he blurted out, “The Rank Two great scholar Qian Zhong, the one who carried the grievances of the people and shattered the last remnants of the Great Zhou’s fate?”

When he had first arrived at Cloud Deer Academy, Xu Xinnian had given him a tour and mentioned Qian Zhong’s story.

Zhao Shou sighed. “He was a scholar worthy of respect—a man who truly earned his place in history. Unlike certain individuals who always seek shortcuts.”

_Dean, are you referring to Zhang Shen, Li Mubai, Yang Gong, and Chen Tai, those four who went astray?_ Xu Qi’an secretly grumbled.

Zhao Shou spread his hands leisurely and said, “*The Collected Records of the Great Zhou* is in my hands.”

A flash of clear light, and an ancient book appeared in Zhao Shou’s hand. The cover bore the title: The Collected Records of the Great Zhou!

Xu Qi’an stared blankly at this scene. Despite his familiarity with the Confucianists’ “boasting” technique, witnessing it in action still made him feel a pang of regret.

_Why bother cultivating martial arts when you can do this? Coach, I want to learn Confucianism!_

_A man’s greatest fear is choosing the wrong path… Second Uncle, you’ve misled me._ He sighed inwardly.

Taking the book from Zhao Shou’s hands, Xu Qi’an hesitated before asking, “Can I take this with me?”

“Nope!” said Zhao Shou.

*Such an outright refusal…* Xu Qi’an lowered his head and began flipping through the pages. With his current eyesight, he could now read ten lines at a glance.

Given its title, _The Collected Records of the Great Zhou_ was naturally a supplement to official history, recording details that seemed like folk legends at first glance but were real historical events.

For instance, the famous immortal official Li Mu from the Great Zhou era was known in the official histories as a licentious man, surrounded by countless beauties. But this book revealed that among his many lovers, one was a fox demon—a nine-tailed celestial fox from the Southern Yao lineage.

Such details would never be recorded in official history.

*Just like the academy’s lesser sage, who made a deer a horse, this Li Mu is a master of the Dong Hu tradition.*[^1] Xu Qi’an mused, nodding to himself as he continued reading.

Finally, he came across a passage that could be described as a folk myth.

During the Longde era of the Great Zhou, there was a place in the south called Myriad Flowers Valley, where exotic flowers bloomed in splendour, never wilting through the seasons.

It was said that a celestial Flower Goddess resided in the valley.

The Flower Goddess was a divine blossom that gained consciousness and formed a spirit, taking human form and gathering the essence of heaven and earth. Whoever obtained the Flower Goddess’s spiritual essence would be reborn, gaining eternal youth and immortality.

Upon hearing this, Emperor Longde dispatched men to search for the valley. It took thirteen years before they finally found it—and with it, the Flower Goddess.

The imperial army surrounded the valley, demanding that the Flower Goddess enter the palace. She refused and called forth a divine thunder to destroy herself, cursing the empire with her dying breath: "Three centuries hence, the Great Zhou shall fall!"

Three hundred years later, the Great Zhou’s fate indeed came to an end.

At the end of the account, a poem was recorded:

*A flower blooming makes all fragrance bland,*    
*Beauty overflowing under the morning sun.*    
*Praised by all as the finest of the realm,*    
*Entrancing both commonfolk and heaven’s son.*

Xu Qi’an closed the book with a blank expression, but within, his mind was in turmoil.

_This poem… isn’t it describing the princess consort?! Wait, so the princess consort is actually the Flower Goddess from nine centuries ago… or rather, her reincarnation?_

_So this poem was originally about the Flower Goddess from three hundred years ago. I had always thought it was just a widely circulated verse that caught Emperor Yuanjing’s attention, leading to her entry into the palace._

_No wonder everyone says the princess consort’s spiritual essence is a rare treasure. There’s actual historical precedent for it! Reading more books truly does pay off. Rebirth is certain, but immortality… unlikely. Otherwise, how could Emperor Yuanjing have so easily handed her over to Zhenbei King?_

_A celestial beauty among flowers… Truly worthy of being the Great Feng’s most beautiful woman, captivating beyond compare. Sigh, another pitiful soul._

Returning the book to Zhao Shou, Xu Qi’an asked, “Was this poem written by grand scholar Qian Zhong?”

Zhao Shou shook his head. “No.”

_Ah, so Qian Zhong was merely the recorder. That clears up a logical gap—otherwise, how would that host abbot have known the poem when revealing the princess consort’s secret?_ Xu Qi’an scoffed internally.

As he continued chatting with Zhao Shou, his ears suddenly twitched. He turned towards the outside of the pavilion.

Three great scholars were approaching together, their expressions gleaming with anticipation.

When they spotted Xu Qi’an, their eyes lit up with joy.

“As expected of a student taught by the three of us! Executing two traitors at the marketplace, single-handedly salvaging the situation—truly a tale of heroism!”

The three Grand Scholars were all smiles as they heaped praises upon him. Then, their gazes turned suspiciously towards Zhao Shou.

“When did Ningyan become the Dean’s disciple? Ningyan, has the Dean asked you to compose poetry?”

Their gazes towards Zhao Shou carried a clear message: _Don’t try to deny it—we all know you just want his poetry!_

Zhao Shou snorted. “Unlike you lot, I uphold the true path of Confucianism—virtue, merit, and words are the three immortal legacies! Relying on poetry alone is but a side path.”

_As long as you don’t compete with us for his poetry, all is well…_ The three Grand Scholars breathed a sigh of relief. Zhang Shen then smiled lightly and retorted,

“Three thousand paths all lead to the Dao. Poetry is also a cultural treasure. If anything, it is the Dean who is too fixated on his own ideals.”

Zhao Shou waved a hand dismissively. “I can’t be bothered arguing with you.”

Then he turned to Xu Qi’an and said, “The real reason they envy you is because of Yang Gong’s past achievements. In truth, Cloud Deer Academy bears no ill will towards you, and this has nothing to do with poetry.”

Casting a glance at the three Grand Scholars, he chuckled. “At the very least, I wouldn’t stoop to their level.”

He needed to clarify this so that Xu Qi’an wouldn’t misunderstand Cloud Deer Academy’s intentions. Otherwise, it would seem as if the academy was only interested in exploiting his poetic talent.

To be honest, Zhang Shen and the others’ behaviour was rather unbecoming of the Academy’s prestigious reputation.

Xu Qi’an nodded.

_Personally, I don’t really care. After all, the poetry isn’t actually mine—it’s plagiarised from my past life. As a rootless wanderer in this world, if I can use poetry to expand my network and trade it for benefits, why not?_

The three Grand Scholars ignored Zhao Shou’s sarcasm and eagerly turned to Xu Qi’an.

“It’s been quite a while since you last composed a poem. With everything that has happened recently, have you felt any stirrings of inspiration? If you have, we can help refine it for you.”

Their eyes shone with anticipation.

Even Zhao Shou, though silent, appeared interested.

_Cloud Deer Academy has sheltered my family, and the Dean even wielded a carving knife to threaten Emperor Yuanjing in court. Though this aligns with Confucian principles and wasn’t solely a favour to me, I still owe them a debt of gratitude…_

_It wouldn’t hurt to transcribe a poem for them. Besides, I can’t keep mooching off them forever without giving anything in return…_

With that thought, Xu Qi’an murmured, “I do have a poem in mind.”

_Yes, a poem I ‘thought of’—I’m just a poetry courier._ 

The three Grand Scholars’ faces lit up with joy.

At this moment, he should have boldly declared, “Prepare the brush and ink!”

However, his calligraphy was atrocious, and he had no charcoal pencil at hand, so he decided not to embarrass himself. Instead, he strolled around the room with an air of contemplation. Upon catching sight of the lush green bamboo outside the window, he feigned sudden inspiration and exclaimed,

“I’ve got it!”

Zhao Shou’s eyes lit up as well. “Does it have to do with bamboo?”

*The Dean seemed to have a particular fondness for bamboo…* Xu Qi’an nodded. “Yes.”

Upon hearing this, Zhao Shou straightened his posture. His mild interest turned into eager anticipation.

Xu Qi’an briefly recalled the full poem in his mind. But to Zhao Shou and the three Grand Scholars, he appeared to be deep in creative thought.

“Clinging to azure peaks, refusing to let go,”

Already aware that this was a poem about bamboo, Zhao Shou savoured the meaning. The word _"clinging"_ was the key. In just one phrase, the resilience and strength of bamboo were vividly expressed.

“Roots embeded into broken rocks old.”

Zhao Shou nodded slightly. This complemented the previous line, further highlighting the bamboo’s tenacity in harsh environments.

“Through thousands of strikes it still stands tall, Braving heaven’s winds with firm resolve.”

Zhao Shou’s breathing grew rapid. The last two lines depicted bamboo’s attitude toward external forces. No matter how much hardship it endured, it remained unyielding.

Among the “Four Gentlemen”—plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum—he had always favoured bamboo. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have built his residence within a bamboo grove.

Zhao Shou had also written poetry about bamboo in the past, but compared to this, he had to admit he had fallen short.

In just a few lines, the poem had captured the unwavering resilience of bamboo, both internally and externally.

_No wonder he is Great Feng’s foremost poet…_ That Confucian Master sighed in admiration.

“This poem may lack grand imagery and complex phrasing, but it is a rare gem among bamboo-themed poetry,” Li Mubai praised.

“You fool! This poem perfectly captures the perseverance and simplicity of bamboo. Too much embellishment would only dilute its impact,” Zhang Shen retorted.

“At first glance, it is about bamboo, but in truth, it uses bamboo as a metaphor for human character. Exquisite, truly exquisite,” Chen Tai said, stroking his beard with a chuckle.

After their analysis, the three Grand Scholars turned to Xu Qi’an expectantly. “Does this poem have a title?”

Xu Qi’an immediately understood their intentions. Smiling, he shook his head. “It remains untitled. I shall leave it to my esteemed teachers to refine it.”

The three scholars instantly took a step back, eyeing each other warily, each considering how to claim the naming rights for themselves.

At that moment, Zhao Shou burst into hearty laughter. “Then let me be the one to name this poem!”

“?”

The three Grand Scholars stiffened, turning their heads toward him in disbelief.

_Weren’t you the one who dismissed Xu Ningyan’s poetry as unimportant?!_

Zhao Shou frowned and said indignantly,

“Why are you looking at me like that? Isn’t it obvious? This poem is a tribute to me! Have I not stood firm at Cloud Deer Academy for decades, unwavering like bamboo against the storms from all directions?”

Before the three Grand Scholars could react, he added, “Step back three hundred li. Do not disturb me while I write.”

The moment he finished speaking, the three Grand Scholars vanished without a trace.

Zhao Shou unrolled a scroll, his hands trembling with excitement as he picked up his brush. As he wrote, he sighed in satisfaction, “A fine poem, a fine poem indeed. My life is complete. Now, Ningyan, this poem is yours, of course, but as your teacher-in-guidance, I have given you pointers and refined it. Would you not agree?”

Just then, the three Grand Scholars reappeared, their faces livid.

“Dean, stop at once!” they shouted.

Zhao Shou waved his sleeve. “Step back five hundred li.”

The scholars vanished again. A second later, they reappeared, roaring, “You shameless old scoundrel! This is unforgivable!”

“Hmph, seems like you three haven’t exercised in a while. Fine, I’ll give you a lesson.”

“We are not cowards! So what if you’re Rank Three? The three of us together need not fear you!”

“Hah! You think three is enough? Even if there were ten of you, I could still easily suppress you.”

Seeing that things were about to escalate, Xu Qi’an grabbed Zhong Li’s wrist and quietly slipped away.

…

At the summit of Qingyun Mountain, clear qi surged into the sky, dispersing the clouds.

Four figures clashed midair, trading blows with seamless precision.

The commotion was so loud that it immediately alerted the students and scholars of the academy.

“What’s happening?! Why are the Dean and the Grand Scholars fighting?”

“This is absurd! Why such a big fight out of nowhere? I hope it doesn’t affect us.”

“The Grand Scholars fighting amongst themselves is nothing new. But why is the Dean involved this time? What on earth happened?”

“The Grand Scholars don’t fight often. The last few times it happened, it was because they were fighting over one of Poet Xu’s verses.”

At that moment, someone hesitantly murmured, “I… I think I just saw Poet Xu heading toward the Dean’s bamboo grove… with a woman.”

_…No way._

The surroundings fell into stunned silence. The students and scholars suddenly felt their faces burn with embarrassment.

Elsewhere, in the small courtyard where the Xu family’s female members were resting, Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen suddenly looked up toward the sky, a sense of unease creeping into their hearts.

“Don’t worry about it. Big Brother must have composed another poem, and now the three great scholars are fighting over it,” Xu Xinnian said dismissively.

_This… doesn’t seem like something a mere fourth rank expert could cause…_

Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen exchanged glances but chose not to press the matter. They turned back to listen as Xu Xinnian continued.

“Lingyin has a very peculiar talent—if she doesn’t want to learn something, she simply can’t learn it. No matter how hard you try to teach her, it’s useless.

“So don’t delude yourselves into thinking you’re special, as if _you_ will be the ones who can finally teach her.”

He nearly added: _Spare yourselves the humiliation._

Li Miaozhen shook her head. “That won’t do. When I stayed at the Xu family’s residence, I promised Madam Xu that I would help teach Lingyin. Things got delayed because of other matters, but now that everything is settled, it’s time I fulfilled my promise.”

Chu Yuanzhen chuckled. He had seen plenty of geniuses in his time. But now, encountering someone with negative talent was a fresh experience.

It might even be amusing to try teaching her.

…

Xu Qi’an and Zhong Li returned to the courtyard, immediately sensing an unusual tension in the air.

Li Miaozhen sat stiffly on a small stool, her usually bright and beautiful face frozen in a dazed expression. Her pupils were unfocused, as though she had suffered an emotional catastrophe—like a girl drowning in heartbreak, dejected and utterly crushed.

Chu Yuanzhen stood by the wall, arms crossed around his ever-sheathed sword, his expression blank. However, the throbbing vein at his temple betrayed his inner frustration.

“You two seem to have encountered something upsetting?” Xu Qi’an studied his companions.

Neither responded.

Xu Xinnian sighed deeply. “Great hero Chu and Daoist Li insisted on teaching Lingyin literacy and arithmetic.”

Xu Qi’an’s eyes widened in disbelief before he cupped his hands toward the two of them in a solemn salute.

Li Miaozhen, feeling mocked, picked up a small stone and hurled it at him.

…

After lunch, Xu Qi’an took his family back to the Xu residence. Second Uncle hired three carriages to retrieve the servants from the outer city.

Once the servants returned, Auntie took charge, ordering them to clean and tidy the household.

Xu Qi’an sat atop the roof ridge, watching the servants bustle about while listening to Chu Yuanzhen and Xu Xinnian engage in a spirited philosophical debate, each showing off their scholarly knowledge.

Inside the hall, Chu Caiwei had brought top-quality pastries from Guiyuelou. Lina and Xu Lingyin sat beside her, indulging gleefully in the feast.

Li Miaozhen was meditating in the guest room, while Susu chattered incessantly.

Meanwhile, beside Xu Qi’an, Zhong Li, wrapped in her simple robe, sat hugging her knees, quietly accompanying him like a well-behaved little girl.

_With the strength of the Xu family now, even if Emperor Yuanjing wanted revenge, unless he sent an army to besiege us, assassins wouldn’t stand a chance._ Xu Qi’an mused.

_Once Daoist Jinlian’s lotus seeds mature, we must leave the capital. Before that, I’ll have Yang Qianhuan and Caiwei look after the family. The Jianzheng has promised to protect them—he wouldn’t want to push me into storming the palace and taking Emperor Yuanjing’s head myself._

Turning to Zhong Li, he instructed, “Stay here and don’t move. I need to meet an important guest. Once she leaves, you can come down.”

Zhong Li nodded silently. “Mm.”

Xu Qi’an leapt off the roof and returned to his room, shutting the doors and windows before retrieving the Earth Book fragment. He poured out a talisman sword.

This sword had been given to him by Luo Yuheng through Chu Yuanzhen when they had journeyed north.

Even now, he wasn’t sure if his kind-hearted auntie had gifted it out of goodwill or if Daoist Jinlian had requested it on his behalf.

Before returning to the Xu residence, he had contacted Daoist Jinlian through the Earth Book fragment and confirmed that Luo Yuheng was half an ally—someone he could cautiously trust.

Daoist Jinlian had also mentioned that the Talisman Sword could act as a messenger, allowing him to contact Luo Yuheng without having to visit the imperial palace in person.

Gripping the sword, he focused his primordial spirit, channeling a wisp of mental energy into it.

In a low voice, he murmured, “National Teacher, National Teacher, this is Xu Qi’an…”

_I need to clarify the matter of the Soul Pill. Otherwise, it’ll continue nagging at me like a bone stuck in my throat. More importantly, I need to warn Luo Yuheng—Emperor Yuanjing might try something devious._

_And of course, it wouldn’t hurt to build rapport with an unrivalled beauty. If I can make Luo Yuheng one of my allies, she’d be an invaluable support._

_Auntie, I don’t want to struggle anymore…_

He repeated his call several times, but the Talisman Sword remained unresponsive.

_Looks like the National Teacher is ignoring me. I suppose my status and influence are still too low. In the eyes of someone like Luo Yuheng, a woman of unparalleled cultivation and status, I’m just not worth her time..._

Just as he was about to give up, a golden pillar of light suddenly descended from the sky, piercing through the roof and illuminating the room.

Inside the radiant column, a graceful figure materialised.

She wore a lotus crown upon her head, a Daoist robe draped over her shoulders. A vivid red cinnabar mark adorned her brow, accentuating her breathtakingly exquisite features.

Her presence exuded a blend of intelligence akin to a wise auntie, the allure of a worldly yet elegant noblewoman, and the charm of a spirited girl-next-door.

She evoked a strange sense of sentimentality, as though she was someone meant to be cherished and protected.

_She actually came?_

Just as Xu Qi’an was about to feel elated, he suddenly heard a noise from above—the sound of tiles slipping.

A moment later, a figure tumbled off the eaves and crashed heavily into the courtyard below.

Zhong Li lay motionless for several moments before finally pushing herself up with a muffled sob, dusting herself off, and walking away without a word.

Luo Yuheng blinked in surprise. “Why was there someone on your roof? I arrived too quickly—I didn’t notice.”

“…”

_No, it’s not that you didn’t notice. It’s that fate ensured you ignored her. Poor Senior Sister Zhong…_

Luo Yuheng’s clear, luminous eyes swept over him, her expression cool yet ethereal. With a faint nod, she asked, “Why have you summoned me?”

…

[^1]: This is a pun that will never translate properly to English. First “to make a deer a horse” is an idiom in Chinese meaning deliberate misrepresentation, or to say something that it isn’t. The Dong Hu trdaition is an idiom for a frank and unabridged writing style, like the historian Dong Hu of Jin. However, the lesser sage had a white deer as a wife, which makes this a roundabout way of saying “deer fucker”. Li Mu had a nine-tailed fox as a consort, making the latter one a sound-based pun of “knowing fox pussy”. Thus concludes my thesis, thank you.
