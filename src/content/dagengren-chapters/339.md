# 339. It's Nearly Done?

“Yes, the Conflict of Heaven and Man has concluded,” the white-cloaked Arcanist replied.

He glanced at the deep subterranean passage, confirming that Fifth Senior Sister had not emerged. Hastily, he activated the mechanism, and the stone gate slowly closed.

In the depths of the Stargazing Tower, the formations laid down personally by the Jianzheng could shield Senior Sister Zhong from misfortune. However, the tribulations must eventually be faced unless one wished to remain underground forever.

*The Conflict of Heaven and Man has ended?* Yang Qianhuan nodded with some regret. “Chu Yuanzhen’s combat prowess is formidable. As for Li Miaozhen, though I haven’t met her, I imagine she is no weakling either. Not witnessing their duel is truly a pity.”

His head shifted slightly. “Who won?”

As a Fourth-Rank Arcanist and a prodigy of his era, he was naturally curious about the outcome of the contest.

“Neither of them won,” said the Ninth-Rank Junior Brother.

“A tie?”

Yang Qianhuan was visibly surprised by this outcome.

“No, the victor was Master Xu. He fought both exceptional disciples of the Daoist Heaven and Human Sects alone and defeated them under the watchful eyes of countless spectators, becoming the centre of attention,” the white-cloaked physician replied.

*Fought two Daoist prodigies alone and won under the gaze of thousands…* Yang Qianhuan’s breath caught in his mouth. With years of experience basking in the limelight, he could fully appreciate the subtle brilliance of such a feat.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Qianhuan spoke in a low, slightly trembling voice, “Describe the events in detail. Spare nothing.”

“I only heard about it; I wasn’t there to witness it,” the young physician said apologetically. “The Conflict of Heaven and Man took place by the Wei River outside the capital. It’s said Sir Xu arrived on a small boat, accompanied by the resonant melody of a qin…”

*I can picture it now…* Yang Qianhuan closed his eyes, imagining the scene. Crowds thronged the riverbanks, and the two main contestants stood in tense confrontation. Suddenly, a stirring qin melody broke through the tension, shocking the onlookers. All eyes turned to the lone figure standing proudly at the bow of the boat.

Ah, it was Yang Qianhuan of the Sitianjian.

“It’s said Sir Xu recited a poem as well,” the physician said, clapping his hands in delight.

Yang Qianhuan’s eyes sparkled, and his breathing grew heavy. His back seemed to burn as he urged, “What poem? Quickly, recite it!”

The young physician struck a contemplative pose before reciting:

> “Crossing the river Wei, sabre in hand;     
> Not for love, nor for hate.    
> Born with eyes that disdain all foes;     
> Myriad battles, yet I draw not my blade.    
> To watch mere youths become new elites;     
> I step into the ring, ready to strike.    
> One blade I cleave life and death;     
> Two hands subduing both Heaven and Man.”

*Compared to Sir Xu’s previous poems, this one seems rather average…* Just as the thought crossed his mind, he heard ragged breathing beside him.

The young physician stared at Yang Qianhuan’s back. “Senior Brother Yang?”

“Excellent poem! Truly excellent!” Yang Qianhuan murmured. “This masterpiece is among the top three of all the poems Xu Ningyan has composed.”

“It’s not that great,” the Ninth-Rank physician waved his hand. “Most say this one is mediocre.”

Yang Qianhuan scoffed, “What do those ignoramuses know? Poetry cannot be judged by its surface alone; one must consider the circumstances.”

He continued with fervour, “Think about it: the entire capital focused on the Conflict of Heaven and Man, their attention on Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen. Who would care about the once-celebrated Xu Qi’an from the Buddhist duel? No one. That’s why, at such a moment, he needed to proclaim, ‘To watch mere youths become new elites; I step into the ring, ready to strike.’”

The Ninth-Rank physician pondered for a moment and found the reasoning compelling, feeling his blood stir.

“Though Xu Ningyan is merely a Sixth-Rank Martial Artist, far below Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen in rank, this makes the line ‘One blade I cleave life and death; Two hands subduing both Heaven and Man.’ even more imposing. It showcases the poet’s fearless spirit and indomitable will,” Yang Qianhuan declared.

“Brilliant!”

The white-clad Arcanist clapped his hands. “Senior Brother Yang, your scholarly insight is unparalleled. I am in awe.”

Yang Qianhuan sighed, “The truly remarkable one is Xu Ningyan. He always manages to make himself the centre of attention, earning fame and glory. In this, I must admit, I am not his equal.”

*If the world gave Qi’an, then why should it give Qianhuan?*

Ever since meeting him, Yang Qianhuan often found himself lamenting such things.

“Xu Qi’an always finds such opportunities. What I lack is precisely that—opportunity,” Yang Qianhuan mused aloud.

“Senior Brother Yang, actually, the Emperor sent someone to invite you for the Conflict of Heaven and Man, hoping you would intervene and stop the two from fighting. But the Jianzheng refused, citing your confinement underground,” the physician said.

“…?”

Yang Qianhuan froze as if turned to stone. Moments later, he staggered, clutching the wall for support before collapsing to his knees.

“Junior Brother… is… is this true?” he asked in a trembling voice.

“Of course, I wouldn’t deceive my senior brother,” the Ninth-Rank replied, watching as Yang Qianhuan began to claw at his head in despair.

“Senior Brother Yang? What’s wrong?”

“My… my brain feels like it’s trembling…”

Yang Qianhuan let out a wail, grinding out each word: “Teacher… Jian…zheng… has wronged me again!”

…

The next day, Xu Qi’an returned from the Jiaofangsi, taking Zhong Li home before heading straight to his room to meditate and recuperate.

Just as he settled in, the dishevelled Zhong Li walked over and gently shook his shoulder. “Senior Brother Yang is here.”

*What does Senior Brother Yang want from me?* Xu Qi’an opened his eyes, nodded in acknowledgment, and rose to meet him.

In the courtyard, he found Yang Qianhuan standing by a stone table, hands clasped behind his back.

Little Pea curiously watched Yang Qianhuan’s back, occasionally attempting to sneak around to glimpse his face. Each time she got close, she was mysteriously teleported back to her original position.

“Dalang, is this your friend?” Auntie approached cautiously, muttering, “When did he even come in? He’s been standing there like a statue. What an odd person.”

“This is Senior Brother Yang from the Sitianjian,” Xu Qi’an explained before addressing Yang Qianhuan directly. “Senior Brother Yang, what brings you here?”

“To watch you,” Yang Qianhuan replied coolly.

“To watch me?”

“You’ve stolen my spotlight time and again, taking opportunities meant for me. From now on, I’ll watch you closely, seizing every chance you get,” Yang Qianhuan declared with determination. “One day, Teacher Jianzheng will see—‘Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west. Never underestimate the downtrodden.’”

Auntie glanced at Xu Qi’an, curling her lips. “No wonder the two of you are friends. Hmph.”

Auntie gave a diva-like scoff.

Back when he was still an unlucky nephew, Xu Qi’an had said something similar.

"As you please."

Xu Qi’an shrugged, then noticed Old Zhang from the gatehouse entering the inner courtyard, calling out, "Dalang, a few of your friends have come to visit."

Following Old Zhang to the front hall, Xu saw Daoist Jinlian, Number Six Hengyuan, and Number Four Chu Yuanzhen seated, drinking tea.

"Daoist Jinlian, Brother Chu, Master Hengyuan."

*Hmm, why isn't Daoist Jinlian in his cat form today...* Xu greeted them warmly, instructing Old Zhang to bring fruits and pastries.

"Sir Xu, could you summon Li Miaozhen and Lina? I have something to discuss with all of you," Daoist Jinlian said with a smile.

Xu Qi’an promptly returned to the inner courtyard and called Li Miaozhen and Lina to join them.

This was Lina's first time meeting Chu Yuanzhen and Hengyuan; during her last encounter, she had been gravely injured and had not come to consciousness.

"Wow, aside from Number One, all the members of the Heaven and Earth Society are here!" The dark-skinned girl from the Southern Marches said excitedly.

This statement didn’t sound strange to anyone because they were at Xu Manor, and Number Three, Xu Xinnian, was also present.

"By the way, where's Number Three?" Chu Yuanzhen asked.

Li Miaozhen immediately glanced at Freeloader Xu. Lina also turned to him, but she quickly recalled their agreement not to reveal identities.

*Oh no, I accidentally let it slip just now! What do I do what do I do…?* Lina panicked internally.

Maintaining a composed expression, Xu Qi’an replied, "He's on a date with the Wang family’s young lady."

Chu Yuanzhen was stunned. "A date?"

"The type you’re thinking of." Xu Qi’an said plainly.

"Oh, oh, worthy of being a charming scholar," Chu Yuanzhen chuckled.

Indeed, Xu Xinnian was meeting with the Wang family's young lady. However, while she viewed it as a date, Xu Xinnian considered it merely an appointment.

As everyone settled down with their tea, Lina began devouring the fruits and pastries, her mouth never resting.

At this moment, Xu Lingyin waddled into the room with her short legs, joining the gathering.

Lina scooped her up and placed her on her lap, and the two started munching on melon together.

Daoist Jinlian cleared his throat and said, "This poor daoist will be leaving the capital in the next few days."

This announcement didn’t surprise anyone. Daoist Jinlian had fled to the capital to avoid being hunted by the demonic cultivators of the Earth Sect. Having recuperated here for half a year, it was indeed time for him to leave.

*If it were merely to announce this, Daoist Jinlian wouldn’t have gathered everyone at Xu Manor...* Chu Yuanzhen sipped his tea, waiting for the continuation.

*What scheme is this LYB plotting now...* Xu remained silent, curious about what Jinlian intended to reveal.

_Amitabha, all banquets must come to an end..._ Hengyuan reflected with his hands clasped in prayer.

_That damned Daoist disrupted my duel. I didn’t even want to see him today..._ Li Miaozhen harboured lingering resentment, her attitude toward Jinlian chilly.

Lina: "This melon is so sweet, hahaha."

Xu Lingyin: "Yes, yes, hehehehe."

Daoist Jinlian sighed, recounting: “The reason I infiltrated the Earth Sect back then was to steal a treasure known as the Nine-Coloured Lotus. This treasure can enlighten all things; even stones can gain sentience from it.

“The demonic cultivators of the Earth Sect have been hunting me, trying to retrieve the Nine-Coloured Lotus. While I’ve stayed in the capital to mislead them into thinking the treasure is here, I’ve already secretly moved it to a hidden location.

“However, as the Nine-Coloured Lotus nears maturity, its aura can no longer be suppressed, which may draw the Earth Sect’s demonic cultivators to it. Thus, I must return to safeguard it."

*The Nine-Coloured Lotus? Something that can even awaken stones? Whoa, Daoist, my silicone wife from my past life might need your help...* Xu Qi’an’s thoughts burned with excitement.

If even stones could gain sentience, Xu Qi’an could imagine himself becoming the envy of otaku worldwide.

_The Nine-Coloured Lotus... I think I’ve read about it in some ancient text._ Chu Yuanzhen furrowed his brow in thought.

_The Nine-Coloured Lotus? The Earth Sect’s second greatest treasure? And it’s about to mature?_ Li Miaozhen’s eyes gleamed with interest.

Lina: "Hahaha."

Xu Lingyin: "Hehehe."

Satisfied with everyone’s reactions, Daoist Jinlian chuckled and said, "When the time comes, demonic cultivators from the Earth Sect will undoubtedly follow its aura to its location. I plan to set a trap for them, and I hope you all will lend me a hand."

The reactions to this request varied among the members of the Heaven and Earth Society.

Xu Qi’an frowned. "Will the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader make a move?"

Jinlian nodded. "He will, but his condition is dire. Most of the time, he remains in slumber, unable to do otherwise. Even if he does intervene, it will only be a projection or a wisp of his spirit—his strength will be limited."

Hearing this, everyone sighed in relief.

Li Miaozhen said, "Alright, but I want a lotus seed as payment."

Everyone else’s eyes lit up.

Jinlian nodded. "Of course. Each of you will receive a lotus seed, and Xu Qi’an will receive two."

Hearing this, Li Miaozhen raised a finely arched brow, dissatisfied. "Why does he get two?"

Xu Qi’an snapped his fingers. "Because I defeated both you and Brother Chu. That was Daoist Jinlian’s promised reward."

Jinlian turned to Lina, frowning, "Number Five, what about you?"

With her mouth full of food, Lina tilted her head, thought for a moment, and asked, "Is the lotus seed tasty?"

... Daoist Jinlian opened his mouth, stared at her for a moment, and finally said helplessly, "It—it’s not about taste. It’s a rare treasure. But if you insist on eating it, I imagine it would taste sweet and fragrant..."

Upon hearing this, Lina patted her chest and said, "No problem, Daoist. I’ll help."

The others felt a mix of admiration and exasperation. What a carefree, happy-go-lucky girl.

Jinlian said appreciatively: "Before the Nine-Coloured Lotus matures, I will contact you all through the Earth Book fragments."

He had been planning this for years, forming the Heaven and Earth Society. At last, his efforts bore fruit.

The other two members couldn’t be relied upon for now, but those gathered here already formed a formidable group:

Chu Yuanzhen, with his fourth-rank combat prowess; Li Miaozhen, a fourth-rank Daoist; Hengyuan, an eighth-rank monk with extraordinary real-world strength; and Lina, the immensely powerful girl from the Southern Marches.

Of course, what delighted Jinlian most was the newest member of the Heaven and Earth Society: Xu Qi’an.

This boy, blessed with great fortune, excelled at everything he did. Moreover, he had cultivated the Vajra Divine Art to the minor accomplishment stage, making him both durable and strong—a significant asset in battle.

Jinlian even thought that, given a few more years, this group might even grow strong enough to challenge himself.

…

Two days later, the Imperial Study.

Emperor Yuanjing privately received the Zhenbei King’s deputy general, Chu Xianglong.

"The first batch of provisions will take a few more days to prepare. No need to worry, General Chu," said Emperor Yuanjing.

"Your Majesty, this humble servant has another task entrusted by the Zhenbei King," Chu Xianglong replied, bowing.

"What task?"

"The King has ordered me to escort the princess consort to the border."

Emperor Yuanjing, usually composed, showed a rare lapse in his demeanour—not out of fear or anger, but excitement.

He masked his emotions well, glancing at the elderly eunuch nearby. "Leave us."

The eunuch and other servants bowed and quietly withdrew.

Only then did Emperor Yuanjing rise from his throne, striding quickly to Chu Xianglong, his tone tinged with excitement. "He... it’s nearly done?"
