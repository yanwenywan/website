# 374. Avenger

It is often said that the battlefield changes in the blink of an eye.

This phrase was perfectly apt at this moment.

No one could have anticipated that the barbarians and the Zhenbei King, locked in a deadly battle moments ago, would suddenly form an alliance and turn their sights on the mysterious warrior wielding the Sovereign Sword.

Faced with the gazes of five pinnacle experts, Xu Qi’an licked his lips and broke into a menacing, bloodthirsty grin.

“You seem quite excited. Do you really think having the Sovereign Sword will allow you to face the five of us alone?” The Zhenbei King squinted and sneered. “Judging by your aura, you’re also at third rank. Conveniently, the effects of the Blood Pill aren’t enough. Your life essence will make a perfect supplement.”

The life essence of a third rank expert was no less potent than that of a Blood Pill. To be more precise, the Zhenbei King had crafted a Blood Pill to harness the vast life energy needed to break through the threshold of rank two.

At its core, it was about "immense life energy." The Blood Pill refined from the lives of over 300,000 commoners provided such energy, as did the essence blood of a third rank expert.

However, killing a third rank was usually an insurmountable task, slaughtering a city was far easier.

Hearing the Zhenbei King's words, Zhujiu and Jili Zhigu licked their lips, their eyes gleaming with greed.

The chance to hunt down a third rank martial artist was rare. The barbarians and the Yao clans were allies, with two third rank experts among them. Though the northern frontier only had the Zhenbei King as a third rank, he held the home-ground advantage, supported by defensive formations and powerful destructive artefacts.

He was a tough opponent. Moreover, the Zhenbei King would not stubbornly defend Chuzhou City to the end; Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu knew that they couldn’t stop a third rank expert bent solely on escape.

Failing to kill the Zhenbei King would only invite retaliation from the Great Feng. They dreaded the prospect of Wei Yuan marching north once again.

Thus, while skirmishes occurred occasionally, full-scale battles had been avoided—until now.

This was different. Now, five pinnacle experts surrounded a single third rank. Even with the Sovereign Sword in hand, it was no more than a needle piercing roasted meat—troublesome, but not insurmountable.

Under the scrutiny of all present, Xu Qi’an planted the Sovereign Sword into the ground, raised his hands, cradled his face, and tilted his head back in a hoarse, eerie laugh.

“After suppressing my strength for so long, I can finally unleash it freely. Five third rank fledglings—barely enough for a meal,” he declared, his voice dripping with sinister arrogance.

Then, he raised a single finger and announced, “Phase One.”

The Zhenbei King and the others arched their brows, sensing either overconfidence or delusion brought on by the power of the Blood Pill.

_Master, you’re really overdoing it. Even if you were strong in life, now you’re just a broken soul and a severed limb..._ Xu Qi’an also felt that something was off about Shenshu’s demeanour.

Each time he revealed the undying body, Shenshu's personality shifted, becoming unrecognisably wild and domineering.

“Empty words!”

The warlock snorted coldly and stretched his hand toward Xu Qi’an. “Di—”

He was going to say “die”, to use the killing curse to severely harm this addle-brained master.

Before he could finish the word, “Xu Qi’an” pressed a finger to his lips and exaggeratedly whispered, “Shh. Loose lips sink ships.”

In an instant, the warlock’s mouth seemed sealed by an invisible force. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t utter a sound.

Xu Qi’an disappeared, closing in for melee combat.

A blinding flash of light erupted. Observers couldn’t discern the battle’s intricacies, only the deafening booms and explosions that conveyed its ferocity.

A figure was sent hurtling through the air. The Warlock, now transformed into a towering figure larger than the azure giant Jili Zhigu, was battered back to his original form. His chest was sunken, his abdomen pierced by a gaping sword wound, and his left arm severed cleanly at the shoulder.

The high-ranking warlock frantically retreated, triggering his qi and blood to regenerate his wounds and reconstruct his arm using the abilities of a Ninth Rank Blood Spirit.

“Careful! He has no weaknesses—I can’t find any openings,” the warlock warned gravely.

A third rank warlock’s “Wisdom” ability allowed them to perceive their opponent’s weaknesses and exploit them with unerring precision. Yet, against this opponent, his usual composure was thoroughly shattered.

“Are you of the Buddhist Sect?”

Zhujiu shrieked instinctively, his vertical eye radiating intense hatred.

Five hundred years ago, both the Southern Yao, who were annihilated in sixty short years, and today’s severely declining northern Yao had suffered grievously under the Buddhist Sect.

Two centuries ago, only the Confucian scholars of the Great Feng could rival the Buddhist Sect in power.

Now, with Confucianism in decline, Buddhism stood unchallenged as the greatest force across Jiuzhou.

“The Buddhists are nothing. The day I restore my body will be the day Buddhism falls!” Xu Qi’an laughed maniacally, embodying unbridled arrogance.

A golden ray flashed by, striking at Shenshu, but hitting only an afterimage.

In the next moment, Zhujiu sensed danger and spun around, his vertical eye firing a beam of golden light.

A figure had appeared behind him but was instantly obliterated—another illusion.

_Thunk!_

Engulfed in demonic flames, “Xu Qi’an” landed on the crimson serpent’s back. He plunged the bronze sword into its spine, dragging it along as he sped down the crimson road.

The Sovereign Sword carved through flesh and bone, severing vertebrae and leaving blooming flowers of blood in his wake.

Zhujiu howled in agony. His enormous serpentine body writhed and crashed through the city. In the eyes of the soldiers, it was as if a berserk snake had been released upon a chessboard.

The azure giant Jili Zhigu appeared silently behind Xu Qi’an, his massive sword cleaving downward.

Xu Qi’an, as if sensing the attack, parried with the Sovereign Sword.

_Clang! Clang! Clang!_

The colossal iron sword in Jili Zhigu’s hands shattered bit by bit, as they exchanged over twenty blows within a blink, finally breaking into jagged shards.

Xu Qi’an vaulted up, seized the giant’s head, and slid behind him with the agility of a fish. With a sharp crack, the giant’s face turned to face his back.

The bronze sword flashed, slicing through the toughened keratin armour, severing his throat and carotid artery.

A geyser of azure-tinged red blood erupted, spraying several metres into the air under immense pressure.

The Zhenbei King suddenly felt a chill down his spine. Following a warrior's natural instinct for danger, he leaped forward, narrowly deflecting a sword strike aimed at his head.

In the brief moment he regained his footing, Shenshu was already upon him like a shadow. The Sovereign Sword erupted in resplendent golden light, as if intent on cleaving through the very fabric of space.

The Zhenbei King's vision was overwhelmed by the brilliance of the sword. His every nerve screamed danger, warning him: *Danger! Danger! Evade, or die!*

Since the Battle of Shanhai Pass, it had been years since he'd faced such a life-threatening situation.

In this moment of peril, his heart grew calm, his thoughts clear as never before. Some individuals, when faced with danger, only grow stronger.

The Zhenbei King, endowed with unparalleled talent, was one such person.

His expression remained unruffled, his gaze steady as a mirror. Slowly, deliberately, he clenched his fist—and then struck with such speed that it seemed instantaneous.

A domineering force radiated from his punch, triggering a transformation in the heavens and the earth. High above, the clouds spiraled into a vortex; the ground beneath trembled as if it could not bear the sheer force of his will.

It was widely known that martial artists were crude and unrefined, with no dazzling effects or ostentatious techniques.

Thus, the Zhenbei King's punch, drawing solely upon his own qi to elicit such heavenly phenomena, was unimaginably terrifying.

Clang!

Fist collided with sword, producing a resonant chime like a temple bell, a sound so powerful it rendered distant soldiers and barbarian cavalry unconscious.

The ferocious energy unleashed transformed into a pure shockwave, causing the ground for miles around to collapse, with the two combatants at its center.

Jili Zhigu, the high-ranked warlock, and the others were forced to retreat, avoiding the devastating shockwave.

Under this immense pressure, the Zhenbei King unleashed the most powerful punch of his life.

His fist was reduced to bloody pulp, his wrist shattered and bleeding profusely.

Domination. It was the path he had chosen as his martial dao, and the essence of his cultivated will.

“Interesting, very interesting. It’s rare to meet someone who pursues the intent of domination,” said "Xu Qi’an," gripping the sword in one hand and covering his face with the other as he let out a manic laugh, a sound that sent a chill down the Zhenbei King's spine.

“Whew... whew...”

The Zhenbei King, retreating slowly, heard laboured breathing nearby. Glancing to his sides, he noticed Jili Zhigu and the high-ranked warlock edging closer.

They seemed intent on regrouping.

Meanwhile, the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect was also shifting, subtly repositioning himself to support the close-combat fighters.

None of them dared to act alone.

“He has no weaknesses. His close combat abilities are practically invincible,” the warlock transmitted.

“His physique is extraordinary—unlike anything we can compare to,” added the azure giant, Jili Zhigu.

“But he seems to lack an ‘intent.’” the Zhenbei King pointed out.

His injuries had not yet healed, his flesh sluggishly squirming as faint golden flames attempted to devour it.

*A buddhist, practicing both martial arts and zen, a monstrous physique… he’s too strong. Since when did the buddhist sect produce such a person? Who on earth is he?*

By now, the confidence of the five experts had long gone.

…

On the rooftops near the city walls, the High Court Deputy Justice and two censors stood on the ridgeline, squinting toward the distant battlefield.

As mere mortals, they couldn’t make out the details of the combat. They could only infer the intensity of the battle from the thunderous explosions and the gusts of wind blowing toward them, transformed from the distant shockwaves.

Fortunately, standing with them was Yang Yan, a Gold Gong at fourth rank. Normally an intimidation figure, he now served as their “telescope.”

As Liu Censor craned his neck and squinted, he asked, “Gold Gong Yang, how fares the battle?”

The High Court Deputy Justice eagerly followed up, “And what of that mysterious expert? Is he holding his own against the five of them? Is he... is he alright?”

Yang Yan, his blood surging with excitement, exclaimed, “...Unbelievable. That mysterious expert is unbelievably powerful. Facing five Third-Ranks, he’s managed to suppress them all by himself.”

“Good! Good!”

The High Court Deputy Justice trembled with excitement.

While the Great Feng soldiers and the barbarians had ceased fighting, the surviving martial artists from the jianghu climbed onto the city walls, each finding a vantage point to observe the battlefield.

Too powerful. This is what a battle between peak masters looks like.

Chuzhou City was a sprawling metropolis of over three hundred thousand people. For an ordinary person, crossing the city on foot would take an entire day.

Even on horseback, it would take four hours.

Now, looking down from the city walls, they saw vast swathes of ruins, with only the buildings near the walls still intact.

This was because the experts in the city weren’t aiming to destroy everything. Otherwise, even the four would have likely been reduced to rubble.

“Damn it, kill the Zhenbei King, the barbarians, and the snake demon! Avenge the people of Chuzhou City!”

A young jianghu warrior cursed angrily.

“Silence! The Zhenbei King is a king. You’ve committed the crime of great disrespect!”

From a distance, a black-robed spy heard the shout and exploded with anger.

“Am I wrong?”

The fiery-tempered young man from the northern frontier glared at the spy fearlessly.

“The Zhenbei King slaughtered the people of Chuzhou City for his own selfish gain. To hell with his kingly title! Even the Sovereign Sword rejects him!”

“Exactly! Kill him! If I survive this, I’ll spread the word of the Zhenbei King’s deeds everywhere!”

The surrounding martial artists, united in indignation, cursed aloud and placed their hands on their weapon hilts. Rugged and untameable, they harboured boundless fury in their hearts.

When they placed their hands on their hilts, it wasn’t for intimidation. They were truly prepared to draw their blades and fight.

Seeing the overwhelming numbers of martial artists—none of them weak—the spy sneered but didn’t advance.

“You think that because of the chaos of war, with enemies at our gates, you can flout the law and slander a king?

“Let me remind you: this is still the Zhenbei King’s Chuzhou!”

With that, he waved his hand, ordering the nearby hundreds of soldiers, “Arrest these men! If they resist, kill them!”

But no one moved.

The black-robed agent turned sharply, his masked face glaring at the soldiers. “Are you disobeying orders?”

The soldiers lowered their heads, remaining still.

“Even though I’m a mere coarse man, I’ve heard scholars commonly say: ‘The righteous gain many allies; the wicked lose all support.’ The Zhenbei King’s heartless actions have alienated everyone.

“And you, his running dog, still dare to bark here?”

With that, over a dozen martial artists drew their weapons and charged, hacking the spy to death.

The nearby soldiers kept their heads down, as though they hadn’t seen a thing, maintaining their silence.

After slaying the spy, the martial artists returned their attention to the distant battlefield.

In truth, they could have taken this opportunity to escape Chuzhou City, far from this chaotic turmoil. But none left—not out of a love for spectacle but to witness the final outcome.

Even if it meant their lives, they would see it through.

Defying authority was a crime, yet the passion in their hearts burned brighter than ever.

…

At this moment, the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect transmitted: “If we do not take the Sovereign Sword, it will be extremely difficult to defeat him. After consuming the Blood Pill, his strength has skyrocketed.”

The words of the Daoist Leader Heilian were met with unanimous agreement from Zhujiu, Jili Zhigu, and the others.

The five maintained a vigilant stance while secretly exchanging transmissions.

The Zhenbei King’s wrist slowly wriggled, flesh regenerating, as he replied telepathically, “What method do you propose?”

Daoist Leader Heilian responded, “I can use a formation to erode the Sovereign Sword, making it lose its spiritual connection for a quarter-hour. The cost will be the dissipation of this avatar.”

The Zhenbei King and the others were not dismayed but pleased instead. Martial artists rely solely on brute force, and when facing an opponent of the same system with superior strength, they were easily suppressed.

However, other systems have a variety of unpredictable methods.

Exchanging one of Heilian’s avatars to make the opponent lose the Sovereign Sword for a quarter-hour was a highly favourable trade.

From a distance, the giant serpent Zhujiu transmitted, “No, with his terrifying physical body, even without the Sovereign Sword, we won’t be able to kill or seriously injure him within a quarter-hour.”

Without the Sovereign Sword, they were confident they could defeat the opponent, but killing him in such a short time was impossible.

High-ranked martial artists were notoriously difficult to kill.

After a brief pause, the Zhenbei King said, “Perhaps it’s possible, as long as our combined strength can briefly reach Rank Two. To clarify, I mean purely the strength of Rank Two.”

Advancing from third rank to Rank Two involves more than just an increase in vitality; it is also a transformation of “intent.”

The azure giant sneered telepathically, “Strength of Rank Two? You think it’s that simple?”

The Zhenbei King replied calmly, “I possess a formation diagram, an early work of the Jianzheng. This formation is called the Matchless Dharma Aspect, and it can unify the strength of multiple individuals into a single Dharma Aspect. Its uniqueness is the reason for the name ‘Matchless.’”

The formation diagram had been acquired many years ago when he had petitioned the Jianzheng, arguing that he needed a powerful means of self-preservation in case the Northern Yao and Barbarian clans joined forces against him.

The Jianzheng had agreed with his reasoning and bestowed the formation diagram, simultaneously clearing out some of his old inventory.

With the formidable enemy at hand, the five quickly reached a consensus.

The azure giant Jili Zhigu was the first to act, targeting not Xu Qi’an but a section of the city wall. He abruptly stretched out a hand.

“Buzz...”

The weapons held by soldiers and barbarian cavalry on the wall suddenly flew out of their hands and converged in mid-air.

Even the heavy weapons, such as cannon frames made of steel, were lifted and gathered above.

The iron melted into molten liquid in mid-air, impurities were expelled, and the molten iron condensed into a crimson sphere.

Xu Qi’an, holding the Sovereign Sword, smirked arrogantly as he watched the scene.

_Master, they’re preparing a big move. Don’t waste time talking, just fight them head-on…_ Xu Qi’an suddenly felt caution, and called to the monk Shenshu in his mind.

However, Shenshu seemed indifferent, standing with his sword planted in the ground, exuding an aura of defiance, as though his signal had dropped unexpectedly.

_This version of Shenshu is too arrogant and unruly—I can’t control him at all… Wait, what made me think I could control him in the first place?_ Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly.

The Warlock raised his hand, palm aimed at Xu Qi’an, and shouted, “Die!”

Instinctively, Shenshu used Buddhist techniques to interrupt the curse technique, but the Zhenbei King seized the opportunity to attack. The first-ranked martial artist, radiating unmatched dominance, charged forward, fists blazing.

“Xu Qi’an”, interrupted mid-spell, raised his sword and thrust.

_Bang!_

His chest caved in abruptly as the curse technique inflicted significant damage, breaking his sword stance. The Zhenbei King followed with a punch to Xu Qi’an’s chest.

_Boom!_

The fist’s intent pierced through his back, unleashing a cascade of energy like a waterfall.

At this moment, the molten iron in the sky coalesced into a bright red giant bell, rapidly cooling into a pitch-black surface. The bell descended toward Xu Qi’an, shrouded by the Daoist Leader Heilian, who transformed into a dark current and merged with the bell. Twisted and malevolent runes covered its surface.

Instantly, the newly forged giant bell fused with the Daoist Leader Heilian, becoming an artefact exuding dark fog, symbolising corruption and the erosion of all things.

The vertical eye on Zhujiu’s forehead emitted a black beam, striking Xu Qi’an and causing his thoughts to become chaotic and his body rigid.

The giant bell slammed down.

The dust settled.

The Zhenbei King and his allies smiled victoriously. The descent of the bell had solidified their triumph.

_Clang!_

Suddenly, a handprint appeared on the bell’s surface, protruding outward.

_Clang, clang, clang!_

More handprints emerged, distorting the bell’s form, pushing it to the brink of shattering.

Expressions changed.

The Zhenbei King no longer hesitated and soared into the sky, shouting, “Follow me!”

Suspended high above, his muscles swelled, and white-glowing runes surfaced, covering every inch of his body.

The formation diagram was within his body.

The azure giant, Zhujiu, and the Warlock leaped into the air, colliding with the Zhenbei King.

The glowing runes expanded, enveloping them all. Then, a dazzling orb of light as bright as a small sun illuminated the entirety of Chuzhou City.

Seconds later, the sun faded, and an incomparably powerful aura was born.

It was as though a divine being had descended, exuding overwhelming pressure, an abyssal and hellish might.

A hundred foot tall giant stood floating in the air. His skin was azure tinged with red, his vital points—chest and joints—protected by keratinous armour, his limbs proportioned flawlessly, and his muscles brimming with strength.

A perfect body, forged for battle.

The giant’s face was that of the Zhenbei King, but behind his head hovered an illusory black shadow, the war soul summoned by the Warlock, further enhancing his combat capabilities.

On the city walls, the soldiers of Great Feng, the barbarians of the Qingyan Tribe, and the Yao soldiers trembled uncontrollably, legs shaking as they dared not lift their heads to gaze upon the terrifying “deity.”

Elsewhere, on a rooftop near the city wall, the Deputy Justice of the High Court and two censors collapsed onto the ground, faces pale and trembling in terror.

Yang Yan watched them, his voice heavy as never before. “Prepare to leave the city immediately. If we stay, we’ll be silenced.”

The envoy members’ hearts sank. Yang Yan’s words were clear—the mysterious expert who vowed to punish the Zhenbei King was about to fall.

“What’s going on?”

The sudden turn of events left the civil officials bewildered.

Yang Yan shook his head. “I don’t know what method they used, but this power is overwhelmingly stronger than that of the mysterious expert. He stands no chance.

“Go, now.”

With that, he leaped off the roof, accompanied by the three civil officials, while the lead constable Chen and centurion Chen Xiao swiftly led the way.

Seeing the martial artists’ urgency and their fearful escape, Censor Liu and the others abandoned all hope of survival and realised they must leave Chuzhou City at once.

…

Bang!

The massive bell was torn apart by an unparalleled, ferocious force, and the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect's avatar was obliterated. Encircled in raging demonic flames, Xu Qi’an emerged unscathed, with the bronze sword in his hand now tainted with an inky black hue, utterly devoid of spiritual essence.

“Useless for now.”

“Xu Qi’an” casually discarded the bronze sword, showing no attachment. He then raised his head, smirking at the hundred foot tall giant hovering in the sky. “What’s the point of getting so big?”

The giant lowered its gaze to lock eyes with Xu Qi’an, speaking in a chilling voice, “I can’t wait to devour your vital blood. It must be delicious.”

“Zhenbei King, you’ve slaughtered the entire city of Chuzhou. Have you considered that one day, the heavens would punish you?”

This time, it was Xu Qi’an’s voice.

Zhenbei King sneered silently, but a moment later, he spoke again—this time in Jiji Zhigu’s voice:

“Zhenbei King, you’re a dignified Rank-3 martial artist. If you dare to commit such acts, you should have the courage to own up to them. What’s this nonsense about shifting the blame for the massacre onto us Yao and barbarians?”

Then came Zhujiu’s sinister laughter: “A massacre is a massacre, what’s the point of not admitting to it? It’s hardly a large matter. They’re no more than lowly ants; when our ancestors ruled all Jiuzhou, humanity were no better than beasts.

Kill them whenever we want, eat them whenever we want. To become our food, to sacrifice themselves to further our lives, was great fortune for these ants. Zhenbei King, don’t you think so? Else how could you have massacred a city.”

The voice shifted again to that of Jili Zhigu, who burst into laughter: “Zhenbei King, we’re not so different, after all. The only difference is that we’re more honest about it, while you humans love to wrap yourselves in a veil called ‘hypocrisy.’

“After today’s battle, word of your massacre will spread across the world. You’d best think about how to clean up the aftermath.”

The giant spoke once more, this time in Zhenbei King’s own voice, his tone indifferent: “Simply bury all the soldiers alive.”

He stood lofty and unyielding, domineering yet detached. A true master of both martial and literary skill, the kind who disdained engaging in verbal skirmishes.

Zhujiu wasn’t wrong—so what if it’s a massacre? He didn’t care about the lives of mortals.

Today’s events were originally a trap to hunt down Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu. But the appearance of a mysterious Buddhist powerhouse had disrupted everything, exposing his crimes to the public.

With the Sovereign Sword’s rejection, the soldiers in the northern borders had already begun to harbour doubts about him. The intelligent ones, piecing together the behaviours of the Yao and barbarians, the presence of a high-ranking Warlock from the Church of the Warlock God, and other details, had likely already concluded that he had refined the Blood Pill by massacring the city.

To the Zhenbei King, the soldiers in Chuzhou City had already been sentenced to death.

“The Zhenbei King… really did it…”

On the city walls, a centurion muttered in anguish.

“Ha ha ha! Humans are fools.”

A barbarian burst into wild laughter, doubling over in mockery. “Our spies infiltrated Chuzhou City a month ago, searching for the place where the massacre occurred. And you still don’t get it—why do you think we Yao and barbarians attacked the city today?

“Chuzhou has ballistae, cannons, and protective formations. Our barbarian population has always been limited and precious. Why would we launch an attack without reason?

“Because we discovered that Zhenbei King had slaughtered countless lives in Chuzhou to refine Blood Pills in an attempt to ascend to rank two. That’s an existential threat to our two peoples.”

The barbarian’s brazen mockery stood in stark contrast to the soldiers’ pale faces.

Many of the soldiers defending the city and the surviving martial artists in Jianghu could have fled but chose not to. Why?

They were waiting for an answer.

Not for Zhenbei King’s defeat but for the truth.

In the hearts of the border soldiers, Zhenbei King was akin to a god, a symbol of the army’s faith, and an object of worship.

He guarded the borders. He possessed unparalleled martial skill. He protected the peace of the northern lands.

Whenever Zhenbei King was mentioned, soldiers would clasp their fists and raise them above their heads in reverence, as though worshiping a deity.

Thus, when Xu Qi’an accused Zhenbei King of massacring the city, no one believed it. But as the Sovereign Sword rejected him, the soldiers felt shock, confusion, pain, and denial…

As long as Zhenbei King didn’t admit it, they were willing to hold onto a shred of hope in their hearts.

But now, that last shred of hope was shattered.

...

“Xu Qi’an” tilted his head back to meet the giant’s gaze and spoke slowly, “Second phase.”

*So the full awakening of power has finally come. Master, your skill takes long enough to prepare. Or perhaps the stronger the martial artist, the longer the recovery process…* Xu Qi’an let out a sigh of relief.

An intense, violent aura surged skyward, rising rapidly.

But it wasn’t from Zhenbei King. It was from Xu Qi’an, enveloped in demonic flames. His body began to grow—twenty feet, fifty feet, seventy, a hundred…

As this happened, bulges formed on his shoulders, which then ruptured to reveal twelve jet-black arms.

At the same time, a ring of fire appeared behind his head, ablaze with black flames.

This giant’s body was entirely black, its muscles knotted and solid like cast iron. Its back bore twelve arms, and a circular halo of black flames burned behind its head.

It resembled… it resembled… a demonic version of a Buddhist Dharma form.

The giant exuded a boundless aura, like a god of war.

Its Dharma form was shrouded in demonic flames, like a demon god.

“You’re second rank as well?”

Zhenbei King stared at the black Dharma form with a grave expression. He finally understood what the earlier “first phase” meant.

This second phase represented the pinnacle of this mysterious powerhouse’s strength—something far beyond the first phase.

“Second rank?”

The black Dharma form let out a mocking laugh. “Back in the day, this poor monk could suppress second rank experts from any system with one hand.”

Zhenbei King sneered, and before his sneer faded, he teleported behind the black Dharma form and launched a devastating punch aimed at the back of its head.

This punch seemed to bring the sky crashing down.

The fiery halo behind the black Dharma form shattered instantly, and its iron-like body staggered forward.

“That’s all?”

The fiery halo reformed, and the black Dharma form smirked. “It’s been a long time since I felt pain, you’re still not quite there. 

“Zhenbei King, for slaughtering 380,000 lives in Chuzhou, I will hit you 380,000 times.”

“Bring it on!” Zhenbei King declared proudly.

…

“Go, go, quickly…”

Constable Chen roared.

A terrifyingly oppressive aura filled the heavens and earth. He felt suffocated, as if his heart might explode at any moment. The clash of “deities” was not something mortals could bear to witness.

The High Court official, Censor Liu, and others were too petrified to move their legs. Yang Yan carried them as if they were sacks, leading the envoy party toward the nearest city gate.

As they neared the gate, they saw soldiers, shaman clans, and Yao fleeing to the walls, cooperating harmoniously in their shared panic, their mutual animosity momentarily forgotten.

Yang Yan knew it was the fear that had seized their hearts.

“To the eastern gate. It’s the closest and out of the battle’s range,” Yang Yan decided, leading the envoy to the eastern city wall, far enough to observe the battlefield in relative safety.

Just as the party reached the wall, they heard a distant _boom_. Turning quickly, they saw Zhenbei King stagger back, his massive body smashing into the city wall behind him.

Dust rose instantly, rubble rolled down in torrents.

The battle of martial artists was simple, but brutally violent.

“We’re watching a contest between gods… this is blasphemous,” a barbarian clansman stammered in fear.

The pitch-black figure straddled Zhenbei King, raining down blows with twelve fists in a relentless storm. Explosions of force erupted, dust billowed, and the ground sank.

“I Don’t care if you’re a king of Great Feng or even the emperor. You slaughtered a city, and so I will kill you!”

The torrential punches struck Zhenbei King’s chest, face, and horned armour, unleashing raw, primal fury.

“No one has the right to wield their strength to slaughter indiscriminately. If you think otherwise, I’ll repay you in kind!”

Zhenbei King’s horned armour shattered, scarlet blood gushed forth, staining the city wall red.

That voice was, of course, Xu Qi’an’s.

_Crack!_ Two of the black figure’s arms broke as Zhenbei King struck with a brutal headbutt, sending the figure flying. Rising slowly, Zhenbei King said, “How laughable. You fight me to the death for a city of ants? You clearly don’t understand the heart of the strong.”

Despite his battered state, Zhenbei King’s voice remained as domineering, arrogant, and confident as ever.

He exhaled deeply. The clouds above were drawn toward him, swirling into a vortex. With each breath, his broken horns and wounds visibly healed.

On the other side, the pitch-black figure’s two severed arms reattached seamlessly. Calmly, he said, “That was ten thousand punches.”

Zhenbei King’s face darkened, his aura dimmed slightly. Raising his hand, he commanded, “Die!”

His palm glistened with blood—his opponent’s blood—a curse meant to inflict devastating damage.

Yet, nothing happened.

The magic flames behind the dark figure coalesced into a black relic, emanating soft yet dense dark light.

The relic nullified all evils, much like a Buddhist *sarira* or Daoist golden core.

The pitch-black figure charged, his every step like an earthquake.

The Zhenbei King lowered his stance slightly, curling his fingers into a fist. With a simple squeeze, the air collapsed with a deafening boom. His raw strength was beyond imagination.

His domineering fist met the dark figure’s combined twelve arms in a head-on clash.

The impact did not ripple outward. Instead, it swept through Chuzhou in an instant. Like a hurricane, it flattened ruins and wiped the ground clean, leaving not even debris behind.

Zhenbei King’s fist cracked open, flesh and blood bursting apart.

He roared in agony, stumbling backward.

The black figure advanced with relentless punches, hammering Zhenbei King’s chest and face. His attacks stripped away the horned armor bit by bit, only for it to regenerate and be shattered again.

“Laughable? Fighting for the common people is laughable?”

_Bang! Bang! Bang!_

“Without the common people, who would you be a king of? Whose noble are you?”

_Bang! Bang! Bang!_

Fifty thousand punches, a hundred thousand punches, three hundred thousand punches… the Zhenbei King’s body shattered and healed again and again. At first, he could fight back, but as his injuries mounted, he lost even the strength to resist.

Three hundred and eighty thousand punches!

The final blow landed.

The black figure’s twelve arms grabbed Zhenbei King by the head, arms, waist, and legs, hoisting him high.

At that moment, Xu Qi’an’s gaze swept across the silent city walls, over the desolate, scarred city. The horrors of the massacre replayed in his mind, the cries of 380,000 souls echoing in his ears.

What does it mean to be strong? 

To treat mortals as ants?

In his mind, he returned to Cloud Deer Academy, standing in the Lesser Sage’s Hall, clumsily writing four lines on the stone tablet:

*To ordain conscience for Heaven and Earth,*    
*To secure life and fortune for the people,*    
*To continue lost teachings for past sages,*    
*To establish peace for all future generations!*

“Kill him!”

A sudden roar broke the silence.

A young martial artist stood atop a battlement, screaming with all his might, his face twisted in fury.

“Kill him!”

A soldier couldn’t hold back and shouted too, only to be glared at by a nearby black-robed spy.

The soldier lowered his head in terror.

The spy was about to issue a warning when another soldier bellowed, “Kill him!”

That cry was like a spark falling onto dry grass, igniting a wildfire.

More and more soldiers joined in.

“Kill him!”

“Kill him!”

The cries grew louder, spreading like an unstoppable tide.

In that moment, Xu Qi’an seemed to see the 380,000 souls rising above the city walls, filling the sky and earth. They gazed at him silently, their collective voice merging into three words:

*Kill him!*

The black figure’s twelve arms pulled apart violently, tearing Zhenbei King into four pieces.

Blood rained down like a storm.

The dark figure, bathed in crimson, stood like a vengeful god returned from the depths of hell.
