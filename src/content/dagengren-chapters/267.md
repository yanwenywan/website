# 267. Xu Qi'an's Ultimate Skill

Fortunately, Luo Yuheng, the dignified second-rank Daoist leader, didn’t care much about Xu Qi'an's little schemes, nor was she interested in answering Chu Yuanzhen's question. Her intelligent eyes glanced at Xu Qi'an and said indifferently, "What is it?"

"I encountered some difficulties while practicing the 'Heart Sword' technique. I would like to seek guidance from the National Teacher," Xu Qi'an respectfully replied.

"Indeed, the 'Heart Sword' is difficult to master," Luo Yuheng nodded and said, "Yuanzhen, assist me in guiding Sir Xu. I must meet the Emperor."

*The Emperor? Is that old man Emperor Yuanjing coming here too...? Daoist Leader, my 'Heart Sword' has already been mastered. I’m not here to ask about the multiplication table, I’m here for calculus...* Xu Qi'an silently complained.

The reason he didn’t voice his thoughts was because Luo Yuheng’s figure had vanished. The door didn’t open, nor did the windows. This woman had simply disappeared from the meditation room before his eyes.

"What kind of supernatural power is that?" Xu Qi'an muttered enviously.

"It’s not a supernatural power," Chu Yuanzhen shook his head and explained, "That was just a fragment of the Daoist Leader’s consciousness. She merely retracted it."

*The methods of high-rank experts are god-like...*

Xu Qi'an was able to enter Lingbao Temple today mainly because Zhong Li, that unlucky girl, had to return to the Sitianjian for some errand. Otherwise, with her in tow, entering the temple would have been impossible, and leaving her outside, she would likely suffer some sort of calamity — or more likely, some disaster would befall the entire Imperial City.

For instance, if the Spirit dragon suddenly went berserk and wreaked havoc in the Imperial City.

Ever since returning to the capital from Yunzhou, Xu Qi'an had frequently entered the Imperial City to investigate cases, but he hadn’t once visited the spirit dragon. This mythical beast held too much symbolic significance for the royal family, and Xu Qi'an dared not approach it. If word spread that the spirit dragon had become his lapdog, he might lose his head.

"The 'Heart Sword' is indeed challenging, especially for a martial artist unfamiliar with the domain of the Primordial Spirit..." Chu Yuanzhen was about to explain the mysteries of the 'Heart Sword', but just as he began, he was interrupted by Xu Qi'an.

"Brother Chu, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding," Xu Qi'an said with restraint. "I’ve already understood the basics of the 'Heart Sword'."

Chu Yuanzhen nodded, not paying much attention, and asked, "How long have you been practicing it?"

Xu Qi'an thought for a moment. "About ten days."

Chu Yuanzhen froze, carefully examining Xu Qi'an before saying in a calm tone, "Don’t joke around."

Mastering the 'Heart Sword' in ten days—what kind of Primordial Spirit would that require? Even a disciple practicing Daoist techniques wouldn’t dare claim to master it in such a short time.

"I never joke," Xu Qi'an smiled slightly.

"Your talent is astonishing, Sir Xu. It’s a pity you don’t cultivate the methods of the Human Sect," Chu Yuanzhen said in surprise.

*Please, don’t start thinking along those lines, or the Human Sect might also curse: “Xu Pingzhi is despicable!”*

*My poor, innocent uncle.*

...

Chu Yuanzhen was a man of restrained arrogance. He possessed the integrity of a scholar and the unbridled nature of a swordsman, but he never let these traits show in his words.

*Compared to the proud and aloof Xu Erlang, Number Four seems more like a seasoned and mature socialite...* Xu Qi'an thought to himself.

Of course, a seasoned socialite isn’t necessarily calm and composed. Xu Qi'an himself was an example. He understood the ways of the world, yet still enjoyed witty banter, much like the young man in his past life who loved to splurge on QQ microtransactions—some things never change.

"What does Brother Chu think of the differences between Jiaofangsi across various regions of the Great Feng?"

The discussion was clearly meant to be serious and professional, yet Xu Qi'an suddenly interjected with a casual question. Chu Yuanzhen, though a bit puzzled, still answered truthfully:

"After abandoning the scholarly path and committing to Daoism, I have not stayed overnight at any Jiaofangsi."

The implication was clear: I’ve taken a vow of celibacy.

Soon after, Xu Qi'an asked again, "The time for the Daoist debate draws near. What is your opinion of Li Miaozhen of the Heaven Sect?"

Chu Yuanzhen pondered and then said, "She has a chivalrous heart, and I greatly respect her."

*Damn, no slip-ups...* Xu Qi'an smiled, "Let’s continue."

But shortly after, Xu Qi'an, once again interrupting, asked, "Brother Chu, the National Teacher suffers greatly from karmic fire. Do you also endure such torment?"

Chu Yuanzhen was startled, "How did you know that?"

Xu Qi'an quickly patched up his lie, "Duke Wei mentioned it to me."

*Ah, that makes sense. Wei Yuan did take great care in mentoring him, treating him as a confidant...* Chu Yuanzhen nodded, accepting the explanation as reasonable.

After all, Number One had once said that Xu Qi'an was highly regarded by Wei Yuan.

"I only practice the sword techniques of the Human Sect, not their mental methods."

"What do you mean?" Xu Qi'an didn’t understand.

"In the martial arts system, I would be at the Refining Spirit stage, but I primarily practice the Human Sect’s Heart Sword, Qi Sword, and Sword Control techniques."

"Then how do you advance? What’s the next rank?"

The three sword techniques were methods of combat, not a foundational system, meaning that Chu Yuanzhen wasn’t following the Daoist system but was instead using the martial system as his base, primarily focusing on Human Sect sword techniques.

"I don’t know."

Chu Yuanzhen was carefree, adopting a 'cross the bridge when I get there' attitude: "The path lies ahead; I’ll walk it when the time comes."

"Let’s continue discussing the practical applications of the 'Heart Sword'..."

Initially, the conversation centered around the 'Heart Sword'. Gradually, however, Chu Yuanzhen realised that Xu Qi'an’s understanding of cultivation was quite shallow, far below what someone at the Refining Spirit stage should possess.

*Oh, right. After the Tax Silver Case in October last year, he was still at the Refining Vitality stage... In just half a year, he skyrocketed to become a seventh-rank martial artist. His talent is truly frightening...* Chu Yuanzhen recalled Xu Qi'an’s information.

With this realisation, his curiosity piqued, and he eagerly said, "Talking theory is quite boring, Sir Xu. How about we spar a bit?"

He enjoyed sparring with geniuses, observing their strengths and absorbing their insights.

Xu Qi'an thought for a moment, realising this was a good opportunity to gauge Number Four’s abilities. He nodded, "Alright, but Brother Chu, please remember to go easy on me."

…

On the other side, Emperor Yuanjing and Luo Yuheng sat facing each other, with a steaming pot of tea placed on the table between them.

"That child from the Heaven Sect is coming to the capital. Does Chu Yuanzhen have the confidence to defeat her?"

Emperor Yuanjing sipped his tea, the rising steam slightly obscuring his face.

"Hard to say."

Luo Yuheng, holding her own cup, maintained a cool expression. "Although Li Miaozhen is fifth rank, she’s quite likely to use this opportunity to step into the fourth rank Nascent Soul stage. If Chu Yuanzhen doesn’t draw his sword, it’s hard to predict the outcome."

"Either way, they are both outstanding talents. It has been a long time since anyone in my Great Feng caught our attention," Emperor Yuanjing said with a sigh.

"What does Your Majesty mean? Chu Yuanzhen was the *zhuangyuan* in the twenty-seventh year of Yuanjing," the female national teacher chuckled lightly.

Emperor Yuanjing shook his head. Chu Yuanzhen had abandoned his official position, becoming a mere wandering swordsman, no longer under the court's command.

It was rather strange. In the past decade, not only had the Great Feng’s national strength gradually declined, but the emergence of talented individuals had also dwindled. Especially in recent years, Emperor Yuanjing had not encountered any promising young people to his satisfaction.

"What is the national teacher's plan for dealing with the Heaven Sect Daoist leader?" Emperor Yuanjing asked, shifting the conversation.

He clearly wasn’t concerned about Li Miaozhen’s arrival specifically. His worry lay in the upcoming conflict of Heaven and Man.

"The last time the conflict of Heaven and Man occurred, the Daoist leader of Heaven Sect had yet to step into the First rank. Your father fought him to a standstill, with no clear winner," Emperor Yuanjing said sombrely.

As he spoke, his gaze grew sharp, lingering on Luo Yuheng's refined and ethereal beauty, his meaning unmistakably clear.

*Dual cultivation was a mutually beneficial arrangement, far from the sinister techniques of leeching the other party’s vitality.*

If Luo Yuheng wanted to make rapid progress in a short period, dual cultivation with him was her only viable option.

At that moment, a sudden wave of powerful qi fluctuation disrupted Emperor Yuanjing and Luo Yuheng’s conversation.

There was a fight within Lingbao Temple?

This was the first time Emperor Yuanjing had encountered such an occurrence.

Luo Yuheng sensed it briefly and smiled faintly.

"National teacher, what’s going on?" Emperor Yuanjing frowned.

"It’s Chu Yuanzhen sparring with Xu Qi’an," Luo Yuheng explained.

Hearing the name "Xu Qi’an," Emperor Yuanjing looked puzzled. He couldn’t comprehend how this lowly Bronze Gong could have ended up at Lingbao Temple, much less how he got involved in anything related to the temple.

Luo Yuheng elaborated, "His cultivation technique is somewhat unique. Wei Yuan brought him here to learn some swordsmanship, so I taught him a couple moves."

Both the national teacher and Wei Yuan had successfully shifted the pot onto each other for their respective protégés.

Emperor Yuanjing nodded, accepting this explanation. After sensing the battle for a moment, he was slightly astonished. "Xu Qi’an can actually hold his own against Chu Yuanzhen?"

Luo Yuheng, now tired of his repeated attempts to convince her to dual cultivate, promptly suggested, "If Your Majesty is interested, why not accompany me to watch the fight?"

Emperor Yuanjing thought for a moment. "Very well."

The two left the tea room side by side, walking through a garden, across two winding corridors, and arrived at the other end of Lingbao Temple. From a distance, they could see Xu Qi’an and Chu Yuanzhen fiercely engaged in battle within a small garden.

_Clang! Clang! Clang!_

Xu Qi’an's black-gold saber whirled around, creating an impenetrable defense as it deflected the branches that continuously shot at him. Each collision reverberated like muffled thunder, sending waves of energy rippling through the air.

Several tree branches darted through the garden, attacking Xu Qi’an from various angles. Chu Yuanzhen stood atop a rockery with his hands behind his back, smiling slightly and occasionally nodding, seemingly quite impressed with Xu Qi’an’s combat abilities.

But in truth, Chu Yuanzhen was more surprised than anything else.

Although he was only using his Sword Control technique, the fact that Xu Qi’an could hold his ground in the face of so many "flying swords," all without showing any flaws, was astonishing. Especially considering Xu Qi’an had only just entered the Refining Spirit stage—this indicated that his mental faculties were exceptionally strong.

Chu Yuanzhen was starting to believe that Xu Qi’an had indeed grasped the basics of the "Heart Sword" technique in just ten days.

Emperor Yuanjing, stunned by this scene, was taken aback. In his mind, Xu Qi’an had always been a minor figure known for his investigative skills. He had first heard of him during the Tax Silver Case, when Xu Qi’an was still just a low-ranking fast bailiff in Chang'an County's law enforcement.

After that, Xu Qi’an rose higher and higher, solving major cases like the Sangbo Incident, earning Emperor Yuanjing’s approval. But this was all unrelated to martial prowess. To Emperor Yuanjing, Xu Qi’an was a capable investigator, not a warrior.

Seeing him now, fiercely fighting against Chu Yuanzhen, left Emperor Yuanjing astonished.

It was as if he were watching a bookish scholar from the Hanlin Academy suddenly brandish a spear and charge into battle.

"National teacher..."

Emperor Yuanjing stared at the courtyard and couldn’t help but ask, "What is Xu Qi’an’s cultivation level?"

"Refining Spirit," Luo Yuheng responded calmly.

*Refining Spirit...* Emperor Yuanjing nodded in realisation. From his perspective, a Refining Spirit martial artist was nothing remarkable and didn’t warrant much attention.

Still, for someone who had been a lowly fast bailiff in Chang’an County just half a year ago to reach this stage wasn’t too bad.

Yet, with Chu Yuanzhen as the benchmark, Xu Qi’an’s accomplishments paled in comparison. Watching the two of them spar now, it was clear: one was relaxed, the other struggling to keep up.

The difference in skill was evident.

"The Human Sect’s swordsmanship is unparalleled. Such divine techniques can toy with a martial artist at will," Emperor Yuanjing sighed.

"Silver Gong Xu is not bad either. Your Majesty just mentioned the lack of promising new talents in the the Great Feng court. I believe this Silver Gong Xu is quite the outstanding talent," Luo Yuheng said with a smile.

Her comment, however, only reinforced Emperor Yuanjing’s perception. In his eyes, Chu Yuanzhen was the true genius, and Xu Qi’an merely the supporting character.

Frowning, Emperor Yuanjing remarked, "His techniques are too lacking. Didn’t you say you taught Xu Qi’an swordsmanship?"

"I taught him the Heart Sword technique. The intricacies of the Human Sect swordsmanship take time to grasp, and even mastering the basics is not something that can be done overnight," Luo Yuheng explained.

"Still, it’s barely satisfactory..."

Emperor Yuanjing shook his head, his impression of Xu Qi’an’s talent now more firmly established. Stronger than the average person, yes—but far from a true prodigy.

…

At this moment, Xu Qi'an, trapped within the sword formation, felt immense pressure. Dozens of tree branches, like sharp flying swords, whistled toward him, infused with powerful Qi.

Although Xu Qi'an had already reached the Refining Spirit stage, allowing him to detect all hostile and killing intent in his surroundings, automatically feeding the information to his mind, he still struggled. No matter how sharp his senses were, he only had two arms and a single blade, making it difficult to fend off all the attacks.

*So, the next level is Bronze Skin and Iron Bones, specifically designed to counter overwhelming assaults... The martial artist's path truly symbolises personal might…*

Xu Qi'an had gained a deeper understanding of the martial artist system. Each stage compensated for a previous weakness, and if someone could reach the Martial God realm, they would likely be invincible.

_Shhrrip..._

A tree branch grazed Xu Qi'an’s armpit, tearing his uniform.

As time passed, more of these "stray fish" slipped through his defences.

Xu Qi'an had at least three ways to resolve the current predicament. The first was the final strategy from the _Thirty-Six Stratagems_.[^1]

The second was to use the Confucian version of a spellbook, which recorded several techniques specifically designed to counter encirclements.

The third option was to ignore his own injuries and unleash a One Blade from Heaven and Earth at Chu Yuanzhen.

But since this was just a sparring session, the first two options were unnecessary, and the third was a life-risking move that would defeat the purpose of a friendly duel.

*Something’s off... No matter how smoothly the Qi flows, there should still be some inertia when the flying swords change direction... Yet Number Four’s flying swords move flawlessly, defying the laws of physics. Doesn’t Newton get any respect? Oh, wait... this isn't Newton’s domain…*

Xu Qi'an pondered for a moment and came to a realisation.

He swung his black-gold sabre, fending off six branches in front of him, and concentrated his mental energy, channelling it into the blade.

He spun around and slashed. As the dark-gold blade collided with the incoming tree branches, Xu Qi'an suddenly grasped the technique of dispersing mental energy upon impact.

_Buzz..._ Invisible mental power radiated outward in a fan shape, enveloping the flying swords behind him.

The tree branches paused slightly, then losing some kind of invisible support, fell limply to the ground.

_It worked..._ Xu Qi'an felt a surge of joy in his heart. Using the same technique, he sprayed his mental energy forward, cutting down all the remaining flying swords.

With that, he broke through Chu Yuanzhen's sword formation.

"How did you figure out that my mental power was attached to the flying swords?" Chu Yuanzhen asked, surprised.

_Phew..._

*Because I actually paid attention in middle school physics...* Xu Qi'an leaned on his saber, panting as he looked at the *zhuangyuan* on the rockery. "This is probably... just natural talent."

Outside the courtyard, Emperor Yuanjing nodded slightly. He turned his head to glance at Luo Yuheng, the National Teacher. A trace of surprise flashed across his face when he saw her stunning features.

“National Teacher?”

Luo Yuheng withdrew her gaze and praised, “This young man has extraordinary talent.”

“What do you mean by that?”

Emperor Yuanjing rarely saw the National Teacher give such high praise to a junior. Although she had complimented Xu Qi'an earlier, it was mostly out of courtesy. Now, however, it was genuine admiration, which piqued the emperor’s interest.

“I mentioned to Your Majesty earlier that I taught Silver Gong Xu the technique of the _Heart Sword_. That was a mere ten days ago.”

After Luo Yuheng spoke, she noticed Emperor Yuanjing showed no particular reaction, so she explained further, “The threshold for the _Heart Sword_ is incredibly high. Even for the most outstanding disciples of the Human Sect, it typically takes six months to a year to grasp the basics.”

With this clarification, Emperor Yuanjing understood.

Xu Qi'an had only taken ten days.

Emperor Yuanjing looked over at Chu Yuanzhen on the rockery. “And what about him?”

“Like Xu Qi'an, he learned the Human Sect sword technique as a martial artist. It took Chu Yuanzhen one month.”

The emperor's smile began to widen, but then Luo Yuheng added, “One month to master the basics of three sword techniques simultaneously.”

The emperor fell silent again. At this moment, he heard Chu Yuanzhen laughing, “What’s your trump card?”

“My trump card?” Xu Qi'an echoed.

“Indeed. From start to finish, you haven’t used your ultimate technique. Without revealing something special, this duel would be too dull,” Chu Yuanzhen said.

“Well…” Xu Qi'an hesitated, then said:

“You’re about to face Li Miaozhen soon. I fear I might accidentally injure you and affect the conflict of Heaven and Man.”

This was an undeniably arrogant statement. Both Luo Yuheng and Emperor Yuanjing shifted their gazes from the *zhuangyuan* to Xu Qi'an.
