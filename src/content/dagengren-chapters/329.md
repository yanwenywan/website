# 329. Challenge

The Next Morning

At the Reflecting Plum Pavilion, the spacious and luxurious bed cradled the still-sleeping Fuxiang, who murmured softly, her voice a blend of sweetness and languor. 

Her long, curled lashes quivered before she opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was Xu Qi’an’s sharp profile—his high nose and strikingly handsome face. He was already awake, gazing quietly at the ceiling.

“Good morning, Dear Xu,” Fuxiang said, her arms sliding out from under the blanket to wrap around his neck, stopping his hand from continuing its playful squeeze.

“Morning? You should say, ‘You were amazing last night!’” Xu Qi’an yawned and asked, “What time is it?”

“Don’t tease me. Your servant can’t say such things.” Fuxiang yawned as well, brushing her cheek against his and cooing, “The water clock is by the foot of the bed; see for yourself.”

Xu Qi’an leaned halfway out of the bed to check, but upon glancing down, he jumped up abruptly. “It’s already eight! You little fox, I’m late for work—if I don’t leave now, there goes half a year’s salary!”

Fuxiang propped her head up with her arm, laughing slyly. “It’s you who tormented your servant all night, yet you accuse me of tormenting you? Tsk.”

Leaving the Reflecting Plum Pavilion, Xu Qi’an headed to the stables and retrieved his mare. Unsurprisingly, his second brother’s horse was already gone, indicating that Xu Erlang had left the Jiaofangsi. 

Riding through the streets, Xu Qi’an kept scanning for street vendors but found no green oranges for sale. 

“Zhong Li is probably still at the Sitianjian. I should go pick her up,” he muttered, steering his horse toward the Sitianjian.

…

The sound of grinding echoed as Xu Qi’an pulled a lever, opening the stone gate to the Sitianjian’s underground chambers. He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, “Zhong Li! I’m here to get you!”

His voice reverberated through the hollow underground.

After a moment, the sound of footsteps came from the staircase leading below. Oil lamps illuminated the figure of a dishevelled Zhong Li, her voice crisp and tinged with delight as it came through her curtain of hair. “You’re here!”

“Come on, let’s go home,” Xu Qi’an said, turning to leave.

Zhong Li paused at the doorway, calling back into the darkness, “Senior Brother Yang, reflect well during your confinement. Don’t make Teacher angry again.”

She then closed the stone gate, her expression unchanging.

Curious, Xu Qi’an asked as they walked, “What did Senior Brother Yang do this time?”

Zhong Li glanced at him and replied in a hushed tone, “Yesterday, he went to the Meridian Gate, blocked the way of the civil and military officials, and recited your poem. 

“His actions enraged the court and His Majesty, who then reprimanded Teacher and demanded a harsh punishment for Senior Brother Yang. Teacher strung him up, gave him a thorough beating, and confined him underground for ten days to reflect on his mistakes. Only then did the court let it go.”

Xu Qi’an was stunned, his expression frozen in disbelief. *Someone would go to such lengths to show off?* 

*I can’t believe I missed seeing Yang Qianhuan getting beaten by the Jianzheng. Such a wasted opportunity…*

Though lamenting, he didn’t forget his priorities. After entering the main hall and seeing no staff around, he turned to Zhong Li. “Do you have any powder to mask scents? I had some drinks last night. You might not know this, but my auntie and little sister hate it when I smell of alcohol…”

“Oh,” Zhong Li nodded obediently. “Covering perfume odors is easy. Wait a moment; I’ll get some incense for you.”

*...Well, that’s awkward.* Xu Qi’an’s mouth twitched.

Back at Xu Manor, he spotted Lina and Susu playing a game of go at the stone table in the courtyard, while Xu Lingyin practiced her stances nearby. 

“Big Bwother!” 

Little Pea pretended to greet him with enthusiasm, clearly using the opportunity to take a break. Lina, wholly engrossed in the game, ignored her student’s sneaky tactics. Her beautiful face was etched with seriousness as she focused.

*This is rare… it feels like watching two slackers attempt calculus.* Curious, Xu Qi’an walked over and took a look.

It turned out they were playing Five-in-a-Row.

*Oh, never mind.*

Having been warned about Susu beforehand, Zhong Li wasn’t fazed by the sight of a ghost at the table. She merely cast a few curious glances.

“That’s a *Mei* demon,” Zhong Li whispered. “Quite rare.”

*I know. They’re pretty and lure travelers into forests to drain their essence. And by essence, I mean the non-suggestive kind…* Xu Qi’an nodded, signalling he understood.

Satisfied, Zhong Li fell silent.

Xu Qi’an soon noticed that Li Miaozhen was missing. Alarmed, he ran to the courtyard and asked Susu, “Where’s your mistress?”

Without looking up from the board, Susu replied sweetly, “She went to Lingbao Temple.”

…

Outside the imperial city, Li Miaozhen, dressed in her Daoist robes, was halted by the Huben Guards. 

Calm and unhurried, she turned back, walking a short distance before she clapped her hand on her back. With a resonant clang, her flying sword flew out of its sheath. 

The nearby guards assumed she intended to force her way in and drew their weapons, alarmed.

However, Li Miaozhen leaped gracefully onto the sword, which carried her upward until she hovered two hundred feet high. From this vantage, she could see the distant Lingbao Temple.

The Huben Guard commander narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing her. Then, a realization struck. *A Daoist woman trying to enter the city… She must be the Holy Maiden, Li Miaozhen, one of the central figures in the Conflict of Heaven and Man.*

*Yet, if Li Miaozhen really were to stubbornly try to enter the imperial city, then all that waited her would be Nightwatchers and experts from the royal guard.*

Li Miaozhen naturally knew that those experts had locked onto her, but she did not mind; she didn’t intend to enter the city forcefully.

Hovering in the air, Li Miaozhen called out, her voice clear and piercing: “Heaven Sect Disciple Li Miaozhen, comes on her teacher’s orders to challenge the disciples of the Human Sect.

“The time and place are yours to decide.”

Her words reverberated across the imperial city, audible to all. 

Within the city walls, officials, nobles, and residents alike paused, drawn by the declaration. Merchants and passers-by stopped in their tracks, gazing toward the source of the sound.

A challenge had been issued, and the whole capital bore witness.

Lin’an Manor.

Wearing a layered red palace gown and playing shuttlecock with her maids, Lin’an suddenly paused, tilted her head, and listened carefully. She asked, “Did you hear something?”

The maids tilted their heads in unison, gazing quietly toward the imperial city.

“Yes, I heard it. Something about a Heaven Sect Disciple Li Miaozhen...” replied the palace maid whom Xu Qi’an had once slapped on the backside.

As her words fell, a cool, melodious voice echoed from the opposite direction: “Three days from now, at quarter to seven, at the banks of the Wei River outside the capital, the Human Sect’s honorary disciple Chu Yuanzhen will take the challenge.”

Lin’an slightly parted her delicate lips, recalling Xu Qi’an’s tales of extraordinary events. Among them was something called the *Conflict of Heaven and Man*.

“Three days from now, I must watch this. My little running dog must take me there!” Lin’an’s heart burned with excitement, and she nearly ordered her guards to summon her “little running dog” on the spot.

King Huai’s Manor.

In the blooming back garden, a woman in a lotus-green gown stood amidst the flowers, gazing toward the city gates. She softly murmured, “Three days from now, at the quarter to seven, at the banks of the Wei River outside the capital...”

Her brows arched slightly, and she smiled with delight. “Another spectacle to enjoy.”

There was no wind, yet the garden’s flowers gently swayed, as if responding to her excitement.

…

Li Miaozhen had arrived in the capital and would, in three days, duel Human Sect’s Chu Yuanzhen at the Wei River outside the city.

This news spread like wildfire, circulating through the capital within half a day.

The most excited were the Jianghu martial artists who had arrived early in the capital. After waiting a full month, they were finally rewarded with the Conflict of Heaven and Man—a battle between the brightest talents of the Daoist Human Sect and Heaven Sect.

Even though many faced the embarrassment of dwindling funds, no one complained. Instead, they felt their early arrival was a stroke of luck and wisdom.

For in the lead-up to the Conflict of Heaven and Man, they had already witnessed a duel of unparalleled magnitude. The regretful murmurs of those who arrived late and missed the contest only proved how fortunate the early arrivals were.

At a certain tavern, the Soul-Stealing Hand Rongrong dined with a graceful older woman, Young Master Liu, and his master. Seated by a window, they discussed the Conflict of Heaven and Man over their meal.

Naturally, the two protagonists dominated the conversation.

Rongrong poured wine for the elegant woman but turned to the middle-aged swordsman, asking curiously, “I’ve heard seniors mention this Chu Yuanzhen—is he truly the zhuangyuan scholar of Yuanjing 27?”

The middle-aged swordsman sighed nostalgically. “Indeed. Back then, I was traveling through the capital and happened to witness the spring rankings. He first became a huiyuan and then a zhuangyuan... Who would’ve thought he’d resign from his post, become an honorary disciple of Human Sect, and now represent them in this duel?”

“Master,” Young Master Liu chimed in, eyes gleaming at the mention of beauty. “I heard that Li Miaozhen is a peerless celestial maiden. What Daoist rank is she?”

His master shook his head. “The Heaven Sect Holy Maiden rarely appears in the Jianghu, and her reputation is not widespread. Even I don’t know her rank.”

He paused, then added, “However, there’s a rumour that the so-called Lady Flying Swallow, who emerged two years ago, is none other than the Heaven Sect Holy Maiden.”

“Lady Flying Swallow is the Heaven Sect Holy Maiden?” Rongrong was taken aback.

Lady Flying Swallow was a renowned name. Known for robbing the rich to aid the poor, she was either doing good deeds or en-route to her next one. Her exploits were sung in praise by many martial artists.

However, she had vanished from the martial world a year ago, leaving her whereabouts a mystery.

The swordsman chuckled. “It’s only a rumour. No one knows for certain. But it’s true Lady Flying Swallow disappeared a year ago.”

At a neighbouring table, a man in a blue robe interjected with a mocking tone. “You’re behind the times. Lady Flying Swallow went to Yunzhou to suppress bandits—that’s why she vanished for a year.”

*Suppressing bandits in Yunzhou?*

Before the swordsman could ask further, the surrounding martial artists leaned in.

“How do you know  Lady Flying Swallow went to Yunzhou?”

The blue-robed man smirked, savoring his drink. “Not only do I know she went to Yunzhou, but I also know she’s the Heaven Sect Holy Maiden, Li Miaozhen.”

Seeing the crowd’s disbelief, he explained, “I have a friend from Qingzhou who returned home this year. He spent the last year in Yunzhou, following Lady Flying Swallow in her crusade against bandits, improving his cultivation significantly. He told me she’s the Heaven Sect Holy Maiden.”

The swordsman’s eyes glimmered with doubt. “If that’s true, why did your friend suddenly return home?”

The blue-robed man scoffed. “Obviously, because the bandit extermination was finished. Late last year, the court dispatched two Gold Gongs and a group of Silver Gongs to Yunzhou. They uprooted the bandits entirely.

“That Silver Gong Xu, from the Nightwatchers, was among them. They say he nearly died there.”

Another jianghu person, better informed, interjected. “Not nearly—he actually did die once.”

“Bullshit! How can someone die and come back to life?”

“Hah, I can tell from miles away that you broke fucks can’t afford the Jiaofangsi. That Silver Gong Xu is a frequent visitor. Just ask any courtesan there, and you’ll hear countless stories about him.” 

He added with a grin, “They say that when the Yunzhou commander rebelled and surrounded the inspectors with tens of thousands of troops, it was Silver Gong Xu who single-handedly held the line against the entire army. He fought until the skies darkened and finally collapsed from exhaustion—but his sacrifice bought enough time for reinforcements to arrive.”

The tavern erupted in gasps. Even the common folk who overheard were stunned.

“One man against tens of thousands? Could such an expert exist?”

“Why not? Did you see that duel? Silver Gong Xu is a once-in-a-lifetime prodigy, even humbling a Buddhist Arhat!”

“I heard it was the Jianzheng who helped him.”

“Shut it! Silver Gong Xu defeated the Buddhists with his own skill. Don’t insult a Great Feng hero!”

…

Lingbao Temple, in a quiet courtyard.

Emperor Yuanjing stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the serene beauty of a Daoist nun meditating mid-air above a lotus pond, her eyes gently closed.

He sighed deeply. “National Teacher, after this battle, in as little as three months or as long as a year, the Daoist Leader of the Heaven Sect will arrive in the capital. When that time comes, you will be in grave danger.”

Emperor Yuanjing let out another sigh. “The Jianzheng is unlikely to intervene in this matter.”

If the Jianzheng could lend his protection, combined with Luo Yuheng’s own strength, dealing with the Heaven Sect Leader would be manageable. However, the emperor knew such hope was unrealistic. First rank experts rarely clashed without extraordinary cause. Moreover, the Jianzheng’s indifference towards the Human Sect made it unlikely for him to act as a shield against the Heaven Sect’s leader.

“If the National Teacher cannot ascend to first rank, then even if Chu Yuanzhen triumphs, it will ultimately mean little,” Yuanjing mused with a shake of his head.

The conflict between the Heaven and Human Sects followed a strict custom: before their leaders clashed, their disciples would duel first. The losing side would be obliged to allow the opposing leader three unchallenged moves in the decisive confrontation. 

Yet Luo Yuheng was only second rank, far below the Heaven Sect leader. Even if Chu Yuanzhen won the duel of the disciples and granted her the advantage of three moves, she would still likely lose in the end.

“Is there any way to postpone this Conflict of Heaven and Man?” Yuanjing asked.

He didn’t mention stopping it, knowing such a notion was impractical. Even as emperor, he couldn’t halt a doctrinal struggle between a second rank and a first rank expert.

Luo Yuheng opened her eyes, their brilliance flashing like spiritual light, and spoke indifferently. “The battle can end in a draw.”

“A draw...” Yuanjing mulled over her words before sighing. “That would require Li Miaozhen’s consent.”

After a moment’s contemplation, Luo Yuheng added, “There is a simpler way...”

…

Xu Manor.

Xu Dalang was playing with Little Pea in the courtyard when he suddenly heard a sharp meow. Turning his head, he saw an orange cat perched gracefully atop the wall.

“Lingyin, go play with your master for a while. Big Brother has something to take care of,” Xu Qi’an said, patting his younger sister’s head.

“Okay! Big Bwother, I want Guiyuelou food tonight,” Xu Lingyin chirped, clutching his finger.

“Fine, I’ll bring you some later. Now run along.” He flicked her forehead lightly.

Giggling, Xu Lingyin hopped away, her excitement showing in every step.

The orange cat leapt gracefully into the courtyard, pacing elegantly toward Xu Qi’an before speaking in a human voice: “Li Miaozhen has issued the challenge.”

“I know,” Xu Qi’an replied with a nod.

The orange cat’s mouth curled into a sly, human-like smile. “I have a favour to ask.”

Xu Qi’an said nothing, merely locking eyes with the feline.

They stared at each other for a long moment before Xu Qi’an broke the silence, murmuring, “Daoist, are you trying to set me up again?”

The orange cat shook its head. “Sir Xu, when have I ever schemed against you?”

*This...* Xu Qi’an sighed. “You showing up at a time like this doesn’t feel promising.”
