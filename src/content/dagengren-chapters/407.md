# 407. The Rules of the Wulin Alliance

Qiu Qian’s expression contorted, struggling — this was the first time Xu Qi’an had encountered such a situation.

*Didn’t Li Miaozhen say that when someone had just died, with the three souls not yet fully gathered, they were no smarter than the simpleton son of a landlord — willing to answer whatever they were asked?*

At that moment, Qiu Qian’s expression gradually calmed, his gaze vacant, and he murmured, “I suspect he’s the First Jianzheng.”

“…”

It was as though a thunderbolt had exploded in Xu Qi’an’s mind, shattering all his thoughts into fragments. His head buzzed with noise, his mind thrown into chaos.

It took him a long time to recover from the explosive weight of that revelation, and then he realised there was something wrong with Ji Qian’s response.

Ji Qian used the word ‘suspect’. From those two words alone, Xu Qi’an could deduce two critical pieces of information:

Firstly, Ji Qian was not a core figure within his faction — he had not been exposed to the most confidential secrets.

Secondly, if Ji Qian had formed such a suspicion, it meant he must have grasped some level of inside knowledge.

Xu Qi’an steadied himself and pressed on, “What is your basis for this suspicion?”

Qiu Qian replied with a flat, emotionless voice:

“I once overheard him calling the present Jianzheng a wayward disciple. Also, he once told me and my fellow brothers and sisters that what belongs to us will eventually be reclaimed. Five centuries of patient concealment was all to strengthen ourselves.”

Xu Qi’an fell silent, analysing this in his heart for a moment before concluding that Ji Qian’s suspicion was likely correct.

The First Jianzheng hadn’t died all those years ago, and had even left some contingency plans — that was why he was able to spirit away that emperor’s descendant. This was the very reason why Emperor Wuzong had failed to eradicate the bloodline entirely…

It all made sense. It held up logically.

At the same time, Xu Qi’an recalled countless details that supported this theory.

*I have to reassess every single case I’ve been involved in since I crossed over…*

*The first was the silver tax case — former Assistant Minister of Revenue Zhou Xianping was loyal to the orthodox line from five hundred years ago. The hundreds of taels of silver he embezzled over two decades — now there’s finally an explanation for where it all went… What’s the most critical thing needed for rebellion? Money.*

*The Yunzhou case involved the Qi Clique’s Minister of War colluding with the Church of the Warlock God — but during the Yunzhou investigation, that mysterious arcanist, the one suspected to be the First Jianzheng, brushed past me, yet helped us capture a spy from the shadows. What was his motivation in aiding me? There was no reason…*

That incident in Yunzhou had always felt like a splinter stuck in Xu Qi’an’s throat. But he had lacked any clues or evidence to form a solid theory.

*The most recent case was the massacre committed by the Zhenbei King. In that case, the princess consort secretly accompanied the diplomatic delegation to Chuzhou — that was because Emperor Yuanjing was wary of traitors within the court. At the time, I had already deduced that many court officials were secretly in contact with the mysterious arcanist.*

*Yes, if the mysterious arcanist is indeed the First Jianzheng, and the faction behind him is the imperial line from five hundred years ago, then everything falls into place. After all, some officials had long been discontented with Emperor Yuanjing’s obsession with cultivation. They could very well have been covertly subverted by the First Jianzheng.*

*After all, if you’re already dealing with a corrupt, incompetent imperial line, why not pledge allegiance to the line from five centuries ago — the legitimate, rightful one?*

*Moreover, the mysterious arcanist aiding the barbarians in capturing the princess consort — that also makes perfect sense. If the First Jianzheng intended to overthrow the regime, he absolutely couldn’t allow the Zhenbei King to advance to second rank. In fact, he would need to find any opportunity to eliminate him.*

*A second rank martial expert, also well-versed in military strategy, would inevitably become one of the greatest obstacles to their rebellion. So every move the First Jianzheng has made was aimed at weakening the Great Feng’s national strength. If I reverse engineer their actions with that goal in mind…*

At this point, Xu Qi’an’s pupils slightly contracted, and a thought floated to the surface of his mind: *What about Wei Yuan?*

If they were plotting rebellion, the number one target for elimination would be the Jianzheng — but right after that, it would surely be Wei Yuan.

Compared to the Zhenbei King, Wei Yuan was even more dangerous — a military strategist who, within mere months, had routed the seemingly unstoppable combined forces of the northern Yao and barbarian clans. A master of strategy who orchestrated humanity’s most brutal and tragic battle in history — the Battle of Shanhai Pass.

He was the true obstacle that had to be removed. The trouble posed by Wei Yuan was second only to the current Jianzheng.

*Indeed, Duke Wei has constantly been under attack from the civil officials. Those garrulous imperial censors are always calling for His Majesty to behead the vile official.*

*Who knows how many of them have already pledged allegiance to the First Jianzheng… Wait a moment — hold on!*

A bolt of lightning struck through his mind, illuminating fragments of buried memories.

He recalled a certain case — one that, on the surface, targeted the empress and involved the struggle for the imperial heir, but in reality, was a veiled strike at Wei Yuan.

The Consort Fu case!

*Consider this — if I hadn’t intervened in that case, the end result would have been the empress being deposed, the Fourth Prince being demoted from legitimate heir to a common son, forever losing his right to the throne.*

*And elevating the Fourth Prince to the throne was the very foundation of Duke Wei’s grand strategy. In that scenario, Wei Yuan and Emperor Yuanjing would have ended up in complete opposition — the rift between monarch and minister utterly irreconcilable.*

*And the mastermind behind the Consort Fu case was Noble Consort Chen — it’s an established fact that someone was supporting her from behind the scenes. When I think back, that maid He’er having a charm that could shield her qi — well, that suddenly becomes very interesting.*

At this thought, Xu Qi’an pinched his brow and sighed helplessly, *Arcanists are all cunning bastards.*

The Consort Fu case was likely just the tip of the iceberg in the schemes against Wei Yuan — not even the opening act. Who knew what other plots were still lying in wait?

“Why is the fortune bound to Xu Qi’an?”

At last, he asked the most crucial question.

Qiu Qian stood there blankly, answering, “I don’t know. I only know that, for certain reasons, the fortune had to be stored within him. Originally, during the tax silver case near the end of the Official Evaluation, he was meant to be sent out of the capital.”

“Why go to such lengths to ‘send’ Xu Qi’an out of the capital? Couldn’t you have just sent someone to snatch him?”

Qiu Qian’s expression was vacant as he murmured, “I don’t know.”

Xu Qi’an asked, “You said you wanted to turn Xu Qi’an into a limbless stump and bring him back. You hate him so much — why not just kill him?”

Qiu Qian replied, “He is the vessel for holding the fortune. Before the fortune is extracted, the vessel cannot be broken.”

*Before the fortune is extracted, the vessel cannot be broken — that’s  good news for me…* He asked again, “How do you extract the fortune?”

Qiu Qian said, “I don’t know, but my father and that great master have been preparing for it for many years.”

*Extracting the fortune is either a difficult or intricate process — just like how the First Jianzheng had to plot endlessly to steal the dynasty’s fortune all those years ago… Judging from his series of schemes, it seems the First Jianzheng was no longer at his peak and could only resort to hiding and plotting.*

*Thinking from a different angle — if Great Feng’s national strength continued to decline, would the present Jianzheng face the same predicament?*

*Hmm… That’s a crucial piece of information,* Xu Qi’an thought to himself.

“Do you know what happens to the vessel after the fortune is extracted?” He stared at Qiu Qian and asked in a deep voice.

“Of course — death.”

*…Motherfucker!* Xu Qi’an swore internally.

Once the fortune was extracted, he would die?!

That made the First Jianzheng his mortal enemy, without any room for negotiation — that much was certain.

The problem was, the present Jianzheng… was also his mortal enemy.

At present, he was a chess piece in the struggle between two generations of Jianzhengs. Outwardly, the present Jianzheng had shown him mostly goodwill, but regardless of the process, the outcome was already set in stone.

The present Jianzheng would inevitably reclaim the fortune from him.

Only by returning the fortune to the Great Feng could the dynasty’s national strength recover, and the fortune of the dynasty was closely tied to the Jianzheng. If the national strength declined, the Jianzheng’s power would decline as well.

With such vested interests at stake, how could the present Jianzheng not reclaim the fortune? The only reason it hadn’t happened yet was that the timing wasn’t right.

But in the future?

Xu Qi’an felt a deep chill as though he had fallen into an ice cellar, his whole body shivering.

“When do you plan to revolt?” Xu Qi’an asked.

“When Wei Yuan dies, when we reclaim the fortune from Xu Qi’an, and when I advance to Rank Four,” Qiu Qian answered.

“Why wait until you advance to Rank Four?”

The first two answers were within Xu Qi’an’s expectations, so he wasn’t surprised.

“At Rank Four, I’ll be able to contain the overwhelming fortune. I’m my father’s legitimate son, the future master of all Jiuzhou — this fortune is mine.”

*No wonder he loathed and envied me so much, claiming that everything I have now was just stolen from him…* Xu Qi’an pondered briefly, then asked, “Your father told you this?”

“Of course — if he hadn’t chosen me as his heir, why would he have given me the *dragon fang*?” Qiu Qian said.

“Where is your hideout?”

“In Xuzhou.”[^1]

*Xuzhou? Is there such a place in the Great Feng…* Xu Qi’an frowned, briefly searched his memory, and confirmed he’d never heard of such a place.

But Great Feng had thirteen provinces, and each province had countless sub-divisions.

In his previous life, he was geographically clueless — he didn’t even know the standard dividing line between north and south.

“Where is Xuzhou?” Xu Qi’an asked directly.

“I… I can’t remember…” Qiu Qian murmured.

“?”

*What do you mean you can’t remember? How can you forget your own home?*

“Where is Xuzhou?” Xu Qi’an asked again.

“I… I…”

Qiu Qian’s blurred face contorted in agony. He clutched his head and groaned in pain, “I can’t remember…”

Bang!

His soul shattered into fragments, dissolving into a yin wind that swept through every corner of the room.

…

On a hillside outside the dense forest, the white-robed arcanist withdrew his gaze, flicked his finger, and scarlet flames devoured the corpses and jackals, reducing them to ashes.

With a sweep of his sleeve, the ashes suddenly lifted into the air and scattered into the distance.

“King Huai is dead. After Yuanjing issued the self-reproach edict, the fortune diminished once again. Next will be Wei Yuan… Ji Qian, your task is complete. You’ve died a worthy death.”

He was in an excellent mood, hands clasped behind his back, walking away with a smile.

…

Though it was midsummer, the room’s temperature felt like deep autumn, waves of cold sweeping through.

Xu Qi’an stood silently in the still room, dazed for a long time. *Was it my question that triggered some kind of taboo, causing Ji Qian’s soul to self-destruct?*

*That doesn’t make sense. He’s already revealed Xuzhou — logically, if there was some resistance mechanism, his soul should have reacted and self-destructed the moment Xuzhou was mentioned. That would have made sense.*

*Besides, even if I don’t know where Xuzhou is, I could always check the records later.*

He sat down at the table, calmed himself, and quietly digested the information he had gathered tonight.

The First Jianzheng hadn’t died; the legitimate bloodline from five hundred years ago still had descendants; twenty years ago, the one who stole Great Feng’s fortune was the First Jianzheng; they had been plotting rebellion ever since…

If these pieces of information were made public, they would cause a national uproar.

The entire nation would be shaken to its core.

*The First treats me as a tool, a vessel for the fortune. The present treats me as a chess piece in his game. Yuanjing wants me dead. This court is no place for me… I’d happily see someone drag him off the dragon throne.*

*But Wei Yuan treats me like a son, and both Princess Huaiqing and Biaobiao are my close companions…*

Xu Qi’an truly felt what it meant to be caught between a rock and a hard place. He pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a breath.

*As usual, when in doubt — ask dad. I’ll tell Duke Wei everything and leave it to him to figure out what to do.*

Having made his decision, he pushed the matter aside, took Ji Qian’s leather pouch from his robe, and began searching through it. Inside were a ballista, gunpowder cannons, and other heavy weaponry, along with enchanted armour and weapons.

It didn’t take long for him to find a purple sandalwood box, roughly three feet long, its surface engraved with dragons and phoenixes.

He pulled the box out of the pouch, placed it on the table, opened it, and saw a slightly curved fang resting on soft, bright yellow silk. It resembled a miniature ivory tusk.

Its smooth white surface was covered in densely packed runes. One glance made Xu Qi’an dizzy, nauseous, and on the verge of vomiting.

He dared not look further and immediately closed the sandalwood box.

*This must be the dragon fang… Bloody hell, this artefact is absurdly powerful…*

According to Ji Qian, the dragon fang was the treasured heirloom of their lineage, only to be held by the chosen successor.

Xu Qi’an instinctively felt that this dragon fang would be of critical importance in the future.

…

In a small town, within a two-tiered courtyard house, candlelight illuminated the hall brightly. Clad in a purple robe, Cao Qingyang sat upright in the main hall, his gaze calm as he looked at the sect masters and gang leaders seated on both sides.

Presently, there were sixteen sect and gang leaders in total, with as many as twelve of them being fourth rank experts, five of whom were senior Rank Four.

To Cao Qingyang’s left sat Tianji, in his golden mask.

This martial artist, who commanded the largest jianghu organisation in Jianzhou, held a cup of tea in his hand, the lid gently tapping the rim. The hall was silent, the only sound being the faint and crisp clink of the tea lid.

“Yang Cuixue, Fu Jingmen, are you both truly withdrawing from this operation?” Cao Qingyang asked indifferently.

Yang Cuixue was the Pavilion Master of Ink Pavilion, and Fu Jingmen was the Boss of the Shenquan Gang. Last night, the two had joined forces to shield Xu Qi’an from the three Lotus Daoists.

Both had sustained some injuries, and their faces were slightly pale.

Facing Cao Qingyang’s questioning, the two wore solemn expressions and nodded.

Fu Jingmen said gravely, “Alliance Leader Cao, while the Lotus Seed is indeed a supreme treasure to us, it’s not something we must have at all costs. But to make me stand against Silver Gong Xu — forgive me, but I cannot comply.”

Cao Qingyang let out a soft “ah”: “Silver Gong Xu has shown you favour?”

Fu Jingmen shook his head: “The Shenquan Gang’s martial arts embody strength, directness, and an open heart.”

Cao Qingyang then looked at Yang Cuixue, his face devoid of expression: “Pavilion Master Yang, your Ink Pavilion’s sword techniques are not lacking in sinister moves. What is your reason?”

Yang Cuixue cupped his hands and sighed: “This old man most enjoys befriending heroic youths and greatly admires Xu Qi’an. That is all.”

Cao Qingyang’s tone remained indifferent: “So, in your eyes, my orders are nothing but the barking of stray dogs — heard and forgotten.”

From start to finish, his tone was calm. Yet those familiar with him knew that when the usually forthright Alliance Leader Cao acted like this, it meant his mood was at its worst.

Very dangerous.

The Tower Master of Wanhua Tower, Xiao Yuenu, said softly, “Alliance Leader Cao, Elder Yang and Brother Fu did not intend to defy your orders. However, a true man knows what he should and should not do.

“Moreover, when the Wulin Alliance was first established, the founding Alliance Leader made an agreement with our various sects: we follow orders, not decrees. If we deem an order from the Wulin Alliance to be against righteousness or our own principles, we have the right to refuse.”

“What a fine ‘follow orders, not decrees’.”

Tianji sneered: “Alliance Leader Cao, it’s well known that the Wulin Alliance reigns supreme in Jianzhou, and that your word is law. Who would have thought rumours were merely rumours. If this spreads, how will you maintain your standing in the jianghu?”

Cao Qingyang’s face remained cold: “What does Sir think should be done?”

Tianji took out the gold token conferred by the Emperor and placed it gently on the table, his voice icy: “According to the imperial system, open defiance warrants execution without mercy.”

Cao Qingyang sighed: “Sir, think again.”

Tianji snorted: “Alliance Leader Cao, no matter how large the Wulin Alliance is, it cannot surpass the court. We joined forces to seize the Lotus Seed — cooperation benefits both sides. Now, Ink Pavilion and the Shenquan Gang are openly siding with Xu Qi’an. His Majesty will not tolerate them.

“If the Wulin Alliance severs its own limb to survive, there’s still a chance to atone for this. Otherwise, when His Majesty sends troops to suppress you, you should know the consequences. Even if the old Alliance Leader were still here, would it be worth it to oppose the court for the sake of two mere men?”

Tianji had come this time to hold them to account.

A mere jianghu gang dared nearly ruin His Majesty’s grand scheme — they were clearly disregarding the court’s authority.

This could not be allowed to stand.

“In that case, there’s nothing more to say.” Cao Qingyang sighed.

Hearing this, Tianji sneered internally. Though His Majesty’s self-reproach edict had greatly diminished his prestige and the court’s deterrent power, the court was still the court — an insurmountable colossus for these jianghu ruffians.

Occasionally, one or two reckless brutes who ignored the bigger picture would disrupt matters. As long as the ringleaders were eradicated and the trend extinguished, all would be well.

In the next moment, Cao Qingyang pressed a palm against Tianji’s forehead and sent him flying out of the courtyard.

The clash of qi exploded like thunder, toppling pillars and walls alike.

In the short span of a few dozen feet, from the hall to the courtyard entrance, their qi had clashed no fewer than a hundred times.

Tianji’s black-robed body crashed heavily onto the street outside the courtyard. His mask was cracked, and blood trickled down his forehead, seeping through the broken mask.

Cao Qingyang merely shook his hand, as if he had done something utterly trivial.

“Cao Qingyang, do you want to topple the Wulin Alliance’s six-hundred-year foundation?” Tianji roared in fury.

He was a senior Rank Four — not yet at the peak, but he should never have been so thoroughly overpowered. Yet in that exchange just now, he found himself utterly unable to resist Cao Qingyang’s qi.

The gap was too vast — so vast that, if they truly fought, he would certainly die within a hundred moves.

The strength of a martial artist ranked in the top three of the Martial Roll was terrifying.

“The Wulin Alliance has its own rules. Over six hundred years, alliance leaders have come and gone, but when have we ever been the court’s running dogs?” Cao Qingyang said indifferently:

“Go back and tell the Emperor — whether he sends troops to suppress us or assassins to kill us, he may do as he pleases. Even if the Wulin Alliance is destroyed because of this, our ancestors will still give me a thumbs-up and say: You did not disgrace the Wulin Alliance’s name.”

Tianji’s expression was grim, yet he dared not utter another threat.

“Not killing you today is not out of fear — it’s simply because you are not worth killing.” With that, Cao Qingyang turned back, his purple robe sleeves swaying.
