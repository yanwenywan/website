# 338. Yang Qianhuan Released

At the base of the Tower of Noble Spirit, Xu Qi'an tilted his head up to gaze at the towering structure. The eaves curled upward gracefully, and the levels stacked upon one another like a pagoda.

Starting from the second floor, each level featured an open corridor for observation. With spring sunlight gracing the seventh floor, the view was picturesque.

Xu Qi'an didn’t ascend immediately. He stood dazed for a while, adjusted his mink hat, and, without much expression, turned to the guard and said in a low voice, "Announce me."

Once the guard returned with a reply, Xu Qi'an ascended swiftly. Along the way, he encountered clerks who bowed in greeting, to which he only nodded slightly and replied with a short "Hm."

Entering the tearoom, stepping onto the soft reed rug , Xu Qi'an knelt beside the tea table. A cup of steaming tea had already been prepared, and Wei Yuan sat calmly reading a book.

"Duke Wei, I have something to report," Xu Qi'an began.

"Speak," Wei Yuan responded.

Xu Qi'an immediately explained the reasons for his involvement in the Conflict of Heaven and Man, detailing Daoist Jinlian's instructions and the reward of the Azure Pill.

Wei Yuan nodded slowly, his expression softening slightly. "I guessed as much."

Xu Qi'an quickly adopted a respectful posture and said, "Your subordinate fears, that his reckless actions must have earned the resentment of the righteous in the court."

He had originally come to inquire about the Battle of Shanhai Pass, but that would seem like treating his superior as a mere tool—a foolish subordinate’s behaviour. Instead, he chose a different order of priorities: today, his visit to the Tower of Noble Spirit was to report his actions, with the inquiry as a secondary matter.

"Not necessarily," Wei Yuan replied, shaking his head. "While you delayed the Conflict of Heaven and Man, you didn’t prevent it. Those who wanted Luo Yuheng dead might be irritated at best."

_Then, Duke Wei, are you angry with me?_ Xu Qi'an let out a visible sigh of relief and continued, "Thanks to the effects of the Azure Pill, my Vajra Divine Technique has reached minor attainment."

Wei Yuan wasn’t surprised and simply responded with a brief "Mhm."

Xu Qi'an waited for further remarks, but when none came, he spoke up, "Sir, how does one cultivate to fifth rank: Transforming Force?"

Setting aside his book, Wei Yuan picked up the tea cup, took a small sip, then adjusted his posture and fixed his gaze on Xu Qi'an. "First, you need to understand what transforming force means. Strike left with your fist."

Though puzzled, Xu Qi'an followed the instruction and swung his fist to the left.

Wei Yuan picked up his book and tapped Xu Qi'an's shoulder and arm, smiling. "Notice the distinct trembling here."

"This... that's unavoidable," Xu Qi'an replied. 

_You're from ancient times, so I won't bother explaining difficult topics like Newton's third law to you._

When throwing a punch, whether it hit the target or not, the arm inevitably experienced recoil, causing the shoulder and flesh to tremble. If contact was made, the arm also endured the counterforce.

"A cultivator at Transforming Force shows no tremor. In this realm, martial artists can perfectly control their strength, wasting not even a sliver," Wei Yuan explained calmly as he resumed reading. "Do you now understand why all systems fear close combat with martial artists? It's because of martial artists at fifth rank and above."

_A Fifth-Rank martial artist can obliterate any other system in close quarters? But that defies physics..._ Xu Qi'an recalled the duel between Yang Yan and Jiang Lyuzhong over him in the constabulary sparring ground. Neither showed any lag in their movements, nor did their strikes generate recoil. Back then, he had marvelled at the anomaly, suspecting it was a divine trait of some higher martial rank.

Now he understood—it was Transforming Force.

"Since you’ve reached this rank, I’ll tell you more about the martial path," Wei Yuan said, still reading.

“Before fifth rank, natural talent contributes three tenths; effort another three tenths; and resources four tenths. Above fifth rank, natural talent contributes six tenths, effort two, and resources two.”

"Why so?" Xu Qi'an asked.

“Mastering every ounce of one’s strength relies on the martial artist’s comprehension. External aids are of little use. In the Nightwatcher Constabulary, only a treatise titled _The Theory of Meridian Flow_ can offer some guidance, but achieving Transforming Force depends entirely on the individual.

"Before Fifth Rank, so long as one has techniques and resources, even with mediocre talent, reaching higher ranks is feasible. Sixth Rank martial artists are as common as oxen, but at Fifth Rank, their numbers dwindle. By Third Rank, in the entire royal court of the Great Feng, there’s only one—the Zhenbei King," Wei Yuan explained.

_Only one Third-Rank martial artist in the court of the Great Feng…_ Xu Qi'an caught on to Wei Yuan’s implication and asked, "Are there Third-Rank martial artists in the Jianghu?"

"The waters are deep and bastards aplenty. Don’t underestimate the crass heroes outside court," Wei Yuan said with a chuckle. "But even so, their numbers are incredibly few. Most abide by the rules, and the court’s stance is to appease them, allowing them to dominate their territories. If you ever have the chance, visit Jianzhou. It’s where martial arts flourish most in the Great Feng."

_No wonder Wei Yuan keeps encouraging me to explore the jianghu. It seems full of intrigue…_ Shaking off his thoughts, Xu Qi'an asked casually, "Duke Wei, your subordinate has been reading history lately—"

His words were interrupted by Wei Yuan's mocking tone and half-smile. "You? Reading history?"

_I can feel the disrespect coming off this academic elite…_ Forcing a smile, Xu Qi'an replied, "Your subordinate does read on occasion. After all, I’m half a scholar."

In his younger days, he had excelled through nine years of compulsory education, but as he grew older, his interest in books waned.

Seeing no rebuttal from Wei Yuan, Xu Qi'an went straight to the point. "I’ve noticed that aside from the “Sixty-year extermination of the Yao” between Buddhist sects and the Wanyao Kingdom, the Battle of Shanhai Pass was a one of the largest wars in the history of Jiuzhou.

"What caused this war? The historical records are vague. I figured you Duke Wei, as the former Commander of the Five Armies, would know better."

Wei Yuan was silent for a long time, seemingly lost in memory. His eyes grew distant, and he began to recount in a measured tone:

“In the 13th year of Yuanjing, the southern barbarians, led by the shaman clans, suddenly attacked the Great Feng’s southern border, capturing cities and counties, spreading poison for hundreds of miles. When the court received the report, it immediately dispatched troops southward to repel them.

“But in August of the same year, the northern barbarians and yao clans allied, assembling two hundred thousand cavalry and yaoguai soldiers to launch a southward invasion into the Great Feng.

“With enemies on both fronts, the court fought for a year, and in the 14th year of Yuanjing, it abandoned two northwestern provinces, yielding tens of thousands of miles of territory to focus on the southern barbarians.

"In the same autumn, the Wanyao Kingdom occupied those provinces and declared its restoration."

Wei Yuan stood, walked to a political map, and drew a large circle in the Great Feng’s northwest: 

“If Chuzhou and Jingzhou were lost, the northern barbarians, northern yaoguai clans, and the Wanyao Kingdom would form a triangular alliance. Whether attacking Great Feng to the south or the Buddhist nations to the west, they’d create a tightly coordinated front, supporting each other seamlessly.

"So, in the 15th year of Yuanjing, the Buddhist nations of the Western Regions intervened. The tide of the war turned. United, the Buddhist nations and the Great Feng reclaimed Chuzhou and Jingzhou within three months. This allowed the Great Feng to regroup and allocate more forces southward to crush the southern barbarians led by the shaman clans."

*As expected, remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom were indeed involved in the War of Shanhai Pass back then. The orphan of the Nine-Tailed Fox, the yao princess—her ultimate goal was to restore her nation. The failure at Shanhai Pass made her realise the overwhelming power of Buddhism. To revive her nation, she must first weaken the Buddhist Sect... So, is that why she set her sights on Shenshu beneath Sangpo?*

Xu Qi'an nodded slowly. Once the enemy's objective was clear, many things fall into place, making it easier to respond with composure.

Then another thought struck him. The emergence of Mahayana Buddhism would undoubtedly cause a massive uproar in the West, leading to ideological conflicts and potentially a schism within the Buddhist Sect. What would the Nine-Tailed Fox think about that?

After toiling for hundreds of years without success, only for a small Silver Gong of the Great Feng to casually sow discord within the Buddhist sect and cause a schism...

Wei Yuan said, "In the 16th year of Yuanjing, the northern and southern barbarian tribes, the northern yao clans, the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom, and the northeastern Church of the Warlock God converged at Shanhai Pass for a do-or-die battle. They sought to challenge the Buddhist Sect and Great Feng in a decisive blow. Over a million troops from all sides were involved in a battle that raged on for half a year, culminating in a pyrrhic victory for the Great Feng and the Buddhist Sect. This event is known in history as the _Battle of Shanhai Pass_."

"Duke Wei, why did the Church of the Warlock God intervene all of a sudden?" Xu Qi'an asked.

"Naturally, because there was something to gain. The Church of the Warlock God... has always harbored resentment towards the Great Feng, rooted in an incident from the Great Feng’s founding era," Wei Yuan replied.

*I know about this. The founding emperor of Great Feng had used the Church of the Warlock God when he needed them, sweet-talking them with terms of endearment. But as soon as the nation was established, he turned on them like a spurned lover.*

"Wouldn't it have been better for the Church of the Warlock God to harass Great Feng's northeastern borders directly?" Xu Qi'an questioned.

“Even during the Great Feng's most trying times, we never relaxed our defences in the northeast. The Church of the Warlock God knew that if they launched a prolonged attack there, and the conflict at Shanhai Pass were resolved, Great Feng would have ample time and resources to reinforce the northeastern front.

"Instead, borrowing a route through the northern barbarian and yaoguai territories to join the fight at Shanhai Pass offered a chance to determine victory or defeat in a single decisive battle."

Xu Qi'an, holding his teacup, sank into contemplation.

The Battle of Shanhai Pass was initiated by an alliance of northern and southern barbarian tribes, but it began with the shaman clans leading the southern tribes in an attack on the Great Feng's borders, followed by the northern barbarian tribes moving southward.

This indicates that the former leader of the Heaven Gu Tribe had mediated behind the scenes, stirring the shaman clans to provoke the war.

This fits the pattern of the two thieves.

One of them was an Arcanist, whose system originated from the Church of the Warlock God. Given that the Church of the Warlock God later intervened in the Shanhai Pass Campaign, it’s clear this mysterious Arcanist must have played a catalytic role in the conflict.

Xu Qi'an could imagine how the two thieves worked to lobby various factions, forging alliances and igniting one of the largest wars in history.

*So, did the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom know about the fortune within me because of those events? No, that’s unlikely. The theft of the fortune was a secret plot between the two thieves. Before my fortune awakened, even the Jianzheng didn’t detect it... Then how did the yao princess discover it?*

*She must have known; otherwise, why would she have had Monk Shenshu parasitize me?*

*Phew... let’s not think of that for now. My long-term goal is to uncover the Arcanist’s reason for stealing the fortune. The Heaven Gu Tribe sought fortune to suppress the Gu God, but the Arcanist may have had a different motive.*

Lost in thought, Xu Qi'an heard Wei Yuan ask, "Is there anything else?"

Xu Qi'an shook his head. "No, that’s all."

He refrained from revealing his possession of fortune to Wei Yuan. While the Jianzheng and Daoist Jinlian knew of it, that was because they had discovered it themselves.

Xu Qi'an had never willingly shared this secret with anyone.

He hesitated to tell Wei Yuan because he harbored a sliver of doubt. Wei Yuan was a national hero, someone who placed the Great Feng's interests above all else, perhaps even above himself.

Xu Qi'an didn’t believe that he held more weight in Wei Yuan’s heart than the Great Feng. If Wei Yuan learned that the nation’s decline was linked to stolen fortune, which was then transferred to Xu Qi'an, how would he react?

*He remains my greatest support, but I can’t gamble my life on his judgment,* Xu Qi'an thought to himself.

"Think carefully. Is there anything else?" Wei Yuan pressed, staring at him intently.

"No, there’s nothing else." Xu Qi'an met his gaze and shook his head.

…

In a dimly lit room, a pale hand holding a brush penned a secret letter:

*Honored Master,*

*Much has transpired in Great Feng recently. With the conclusion of the Official Evaluation, the factional struggles have begun to subside. Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang have joined forces to address the corruption among clerks.*

*From certain back-channels, I’ve learned that their next targets are the misappropriation of military land and tax evasion. Hah, the duo’s alliance indeed sweeps through the court like a tempest.*

*But as long as Emperor Yuanjing does not abandon his pursuit of immortality, he will remain an insatiable glutton, devouring the Great Feng’s national strength. Any tax relief measures will inevitably face resistance.*

*Rest assured, within the next decade, the Great Feng’s strength will plummet to its lowest point. Without this powerful ally, even a strong Buddhist Sect will be isolated and vulnerable. If another Battle of Shanhai Pass arises, we will surely be the victors.*

*Ah, there is one piece of good news: during the Sitianjian’s conflict with the Buddhist Sect, Silver Gong Xu Qi'an proposed the concept of Mahayana Buddhism, inspiring Arhat Du’e’s enlightenment. I predict that this year, the West may experience great upheaval, which will be an opportunity for us.*

*He is a man of extraordinary talent and boundless potential. May I dare to ask, Master, what plans do you have for him?*

The pale hand set down the brush, gazing silently at the letter for a long while.

…

The Sitianjian.

The creak of stone doors echoed as the entrance to the underground opened. A Ninth-Rank Arcanist called down the dim corridor, "Senior Brother Yang, five days has passed. You may come out now."

A moment later, a figure in white retreated backward up the stairs, stubbornly presenting the back of his head to the world.

"I, Yang Qianhuan, finally return to the mortal realm. No one can suppress me," he said slowly.

"Yes, yes…" the Ninth-Rank Arcanist responded absentmindedly, reminding him, "Next time, don’t do anything stupid. The Jianzheng said if you keep imitating Xu Qi'an, he’ll seal you underground forever."

Yang Qianhuan snorted. "Why would I imitate him? He merely accomplished what I intended to do."

*Mental...* the Ninth-Rank Arcanist muttered inwardly.

"Tell me, what happened in the world while I was in seclusion?" Yang Qianhuan asked, hands clasped behind his back, his tone indifferent.
