Wang Zhenwen frowned slightly and responded in a deep voice, “Come in!”

He knew that his daughter was sensible and would not disturb him at such a time without good reason.

The study door was pushed open, and Wang Simu stood at the entrance, gracefully saluting with just the right amount of decorum. “Father, Sir Xu has an urgent matter to discuss.”

Thinking that the “Sir Xu” Wang Simu referred to was Xu Qi’an, Minister Sun and the others’ eyes lit up with great interest.

Though a troublesome figure, his ability to stir up matters and his methods had long won the recognition of the court officials.

What was Xu Qi’an’s intention in visiting Wang Manor at this moment?

Wang Zhenwen was also invigorated and said, “Invite him in.”

Wang Simu turned her head and looked to the side. A few seconds later, Xu Erlang, with a bruised nose and swollen face, stepped out from the doorway, crossed the threshold, and bowed. “This humble official greets the esteemed sirs.”

*Oh, it’s him...* Qian Qingshu and the others shook their heads.

Xu Cijiu was indeed a remarkable talent, outstanding in both knowledge and courage, but compared to his elder brother, he fell far short.

In their eyes, Xu Cijiu was an excellent and promising junior. But Xu Qi’an, in their view, was an opponent who made their scalps tingle.

Their weight was incomparable.

A trace of disappointment flashed through Wang Zhenwen’s eyes, but he quickly recovered and nodded. “Sir Xu, what business do you have with this official?”

Xu Xinnian pulled a stack of secret letters from his sleeve, strode to the desk, and pushed them towards the Prime Minister. “These documents will surely be of use to you, Prime Minister Sir.”

Prime Minister Wang glanced at them indifferently, picked them up, and flipped through them casually. His gaze suddenly froze.

He quickly finished reading the first letter, then impatiently unfolded the second, the third…

After reading them all, Prime Minister Wang remained seated, motionless, as if in a daze, or deep in thought.

Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law and Grand Secretary Qian Qingshu exchanged glances. The latter leaned forward slightly and tentatively asked, “Prime Minister?”

The Minister of Personnel and others also exchanged looks, realizing that these letters were anything but ordinary.

Prime Minister Wang sorted the secret letters and handed them to the nearest Minister Sun. As the latter reached out to take them, Prime Minister Wang quickly reminded him, “Be careful.”

Minister Sun was momentarily stunned, seeming slightly startled. He nodded and then focused his attention on the letters, unfolding them to read.

As he read, he suddenly stiffened, his eyes widening slightly.

After a few seconds of silence, he hurriedly unfolded the remaining letters, his movements rough and impatient. Prime Minister Wang’s brows twitched, worried that the old man might damage the documents.

Minister Sun’s reaction only made the other academians and ministers even more curious and puzzled.

They were eager to know what was written in the letters.

“Good, very good! With these documents, we won’t need to make concessions to draw in a large number of forces. Does His Majesty wish to investigate? Hah, even if he investigates until next year, he won’t find anything.”

Minister Sun sneered repeatedly.

“Let me see.”

The Minister of Personnel was the first to snatch the letters and unfold them to read. After a dozen seconds, he was so excited that he exclaimed “Marvellous” three times in a row.

“I had considered gathering evidence of Yuan Xiong and the others’ crimes to counterattack, but there wasn’t enough time, and the other side had long since cleaned up their tracks. That path was a dead end. But this—this is like having a pillow delivered just as I was about to fall asleep.”

In the study, the high-ranking officials read the letters one by one. Their previous heavy expressions transformed into exhilarated smiles.

Standing at the doorway, Wang Simu silently observed the scene—the shift from her father and uncles’ grave expressions to their bright laughter after reading the letters. She took it all in.

*Though the letters belong to Xu Qi’an, it was Erlang who delivered them. father couldn’t possibly ignore this favour...* She quietly exhaled, feeling increasingly confident about her future.

Prime Minister Wang retrieved the letters and placed them on the desk. Then, looking at Xu Erlang, he asked in a kind tone, “Sir Xu, where did these letters come from?”

Minister Sun, Minister Xu, and the Grand Secretary all turned their eyes to Xu Erlang.

Xu Erlang bowed. “From my elder brother.”

*So it was him...* Minister Sun’s feelings were complicated—so complex that even he could not define them. There was no doubt that he hated Xu Qi’an.

Their enmity had been established during the Sangpo case. That little brat had repeatedly opposed him. The worst was when he wrote a poem to insult him, nailing him to the pillar of shame.

No, it wasn’t the kidnapping of his son—it was the poem.

By the rules of the bureaucracy, such a grudge was irreconcilable. In fact, Minister Sun had long wanted to destroy him and had worked tirelessly toward that goal.

Until the Chuzhou massacre case, which became a turning point.

Some people were like that—you might hate them to the core, yet still find yourself genuinely respecting them for certain things.

And now, at a critical moment for the Wang clique’s survival, Xu Qi’an had delivered such crucial information. They knew that having these documents in their hands meant this crisis was as good as resolved.

This favour was enormous, and Minister Sun simply could not refuse it.

Qian Qingshu and the others were both surprised and unsurprised. The letters came from Duke Cao, and who had killed Duke Cao?

The surprise was that they could not believe Xu Qi’an would actually help them.

Prime Minister Wang let out a breath, his expression unchanged. “What does he want?”

Xu Erlang bowed. “Once tomorrow’s court affairs are settled, my brother will visit in person.”

Prime Minister Wang pondered for a few seconds before nodding. “Very well.”

At this moment, Wang Simu softly said, “Father, to obtain these letters, Erlang nearly fell out with his brother. The injuries on his face were inflicted by that Xu Qi’an. Erlang simply chooses not to take credit.”

Prime Minister Wang was taken aback and examined Xu Erlang carefully. His gaze gradually softened.

Qian Qingshu and the others looked at Xu Erlang, then turned to Wang Simu, their expressions rather peculiar.

They were all seasoned bureaucrats and immediately discerned many implications.

*If Xu Qi’an had been unwilling, Xu Xinnian wouldn’t have obtained these letters even if he risked his life. After leaving officialdom, he was clearly steering the Xu family toward finding a patron...* Qian Qingshu’s heart warmed at the thought.

To him, Xu Qi’an extending an olive branch was a good thing. Though he was Wei Yuan’s trusted aide and though Wei Yuan was at odds with the Wang clique, outside of that conflict, if they ever needed Xu Qi’an’s help, their connection through Xu Xinnian would ensure that he would not refuse. There was room for collaboration.

Xu Qi’an was a useful and effective tool.

After the year of official evaluation, most of the court officials had come to similar conclusions.

If the Wang clique could secure this tool, it would undoubtedly be of great use in the future.

That young man was a formidable debater. If they could elevate him, he would be an unrivalled force in court arguments. Moreover, he seemed to have some ambiguous relations with Simu…

*This young man has a formidable tongue. If we can elevate him, he would be an unrivalled force in court arguments. And, he seems to have some relations with Simu… most importantly, if we get Xu Cijiu, then the tool of Xu Qi’an would be at our disposal…* Minister Xu of the Ministry of Personnel thought deeply.

The others had similar thoughts, quickly weighing the pros and cons while speculating about Xu Xinnian and Wang Simu’s relationship.

Prime Minister Wang coughed and said, “It’s getting late. Divide the letters and let us each make a trip.”

He did not spare Xu Xinnian another glance.

…

Wang Simu sent Xu Xinnian out of the imperial city before dusk, giving him a large quantity of medicinal wine and powders for bruises. When she returned home, she heard her elder and second brothers, along with their mother, talking in the hall.

Second Brother Wang said in a relaxed tone, "Father and the uncles seem to have found a solution. When they left, their steps were light, and their brows were no longer furrowed. I chased after them to ask, and Uncle Qian said there was no need to worry."

Eldest Brother Wang laughed. "Father even specifically instructed the steward to notify the kitchen to prepare deep-fried pork for dinner. He hasn’t had that dish in a long time because of his health regimen."

Second Brother Wang clapped his hands. "That means Father’s worries are gone, and he feels completely at ease."

Madam Wang, listening from the side, also smiled. "Simu was right. Your father has weathered all kinds of storms—there’s no need to worry."

Seeing Wang Simu enter, Second Brother Wang grinned. "Sister, Father just left the residence. Let me tell you some good news—Uncle Qian says he has found a way to turn the situation around."

After a brief pause, he added, "Where’s that brat? I want to take this opportunity to test him, see if he can endure hardship with you. Take me to him—I’ll tell him the Wang family is facing a great crisis and has no future, and we’ll see how he reacts."

As he spoke with enthusiasm, Wang Simu coldly interrupted, "Compared to you, who only talks big, he’s far stronger."

Second Brother Wang glared. "Sister, how can you say that?"

Eldest Brother Wang was in good spirits and was happy to humour his younger brother. He smiled and said, "The scholars of Cloud Deer Academy have good character, so there’s no need to worry. But since your second brother wants to test him, let him try."

Wang Simu pursed her lips, sat down, took a sip of tea, and said slowly, "Father and the uncles' solution is evidence of corruption and lawbreaking by several high-ranking officials."

Eldest Brother Wang was taken aback. "How do you know?"

"Because Xu Erlang brought it. He paid a great price for it," Wang Simu said with a mix of sweetness and heartache.

"That Xu Erlang brought…" Second Brother Wang murmured.

"This… This is an incredibly valuable bargaining chip, and he just handed it over?" Eldest Brother Wang murmured as well.

Madam Wang observed her two sons’ expressions and realised that the Xu family boy her daughter favoured had played a pivotal role in this matter.

…

For the next three days, the political scene in the capital was turbulent. Initially, the neutral factions coldly watched as the Wang Clique was suppressed by imperial power, leaving them in a state of panic. Meanwhile, the "Imperial Power Clique," represented by Yuan Xiong and Qin Yuandao, sharpened their knives in preparation.

However, as events unfolded, the High Court was the first to take a stand, siding with the Wang Clique. It joined forces with the Ministry of Law to exonerate imprisoned Wang Clique officials, leading to a tug-of-war with the Censorate.

Then, many officials from the Six Ministries defected, impeaching Qin Yuandao and Yuan Xiong for factional purges and abuse of power. Suddenly, the fire turned on them.

Next, several powerful figures from the noble families also submitted memorials to impeach Yuan Xiong and Qin Yuandao.

In a short time, various factions stepped forward to support the Wang Clique, while the Ministry of Law and the High Court stalled the trial of the "Wang Clique criminals," preventing Yuan Xiong and his allies from executing their plans.

With no verdict in sight, impeachment memorials flooded the court, and rumours spread that Emperor Yuanjing was settling scores. It was said that all those who had forced him to issue the self-reproach edict would now face retribution.

The atmosphere grew tense, and gossip ran rampant.

But it didn’t stop there. The officials from the Six Ministries and the censors led by Zhang Xingying, like sharks smelling blood, eagerly submitted memorials denouncing Emperor Yuanjing’s narrow-minded retaliation, claiming it damaged the imperial family’s dignity and the emperor’s prestige.

For the Six Ministries officials, criticising the emperor in memorials was a joyous occasion—it proved their integrity, earned them fame, and elevated their status in both officialdom and scholarly circles.

On the fifth day, after a furious outburst in his palace, Emperor Yuanjing put an end to the matter and ordered the release of the imprisoned Wang Clique officials.

Yuan Xiong was demoted to Right Censor-in-Chief, and the previous Right Censor-in-Chief, Liu Hong, took his place.

The Deputy Minister of War, Qin Yuandao, was so enraged he fell ill and was bedridden.

…

This day was rest day. Having observed the entire political shift, the Crown Prince, under the pretext of admiring flowers, urgently summoned Minister Xu of the Ministry of Personnel.

In the Eastern Palace garden, the Crown Prince sat in a pavilion, took a sip of wine, and said, "The past few days’ political changes have been astonishing. I still don’t fully understand them—Minister Xu, please enlighten me."

Minister Xu, being a member of the Wang Clique and a supporter of the Crown Prince, was the perfect person to call upon.

Dressed in casual attire, he enjoyed the cool breeze in the garden, carrying a faint floral fragrance, and smiled leisurely. "There’s no great mystery in this matter. Recently, Hanlin Academy bachelor Xu Xinnian delivered several confidential letters left behind by Duke Cao."

He then explained everything in detail.

The Crown Prince’s breathing quickened slightly. "Where are those letters? Are there more? There must be more! Duke Cao wielded great power for years—he couldn't have left behind only a few letters."

If he could obtain those letters, his influence would soar, securing his position as Crown Prince.

"I thought the same," Minister Xu said with a smile, "but unfortunately, that Xu Qi’an is Wei Yuan’s man…" He left the rest unsaid.

The Crown Prince’s mind raced. Just because the Wang Clique couldn’t obtain them didn’t mean he couldn’t.

Now that he thought about it, the letter Lin’an had sent back then must have had an effect—otherwise, why would Xu Qi’an have entrusted the letters to the Wang Prime Minister through his cousin?

Xu Qi’an’s lack of reply was a deliberate avoidance, given his sensitive position.

*I need to visit Shaoyin Palace and have Lin’an find a way to contact Xu Qi’an to probe him…* The Crown Prince suddenly found his wine tasteless and felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles.

After exchanging a few more words with Minister Xu, he sent him off and immediately made his way to Shaoyin Palace.

…

Shaoyin Palace.

After lunch, Lin’an took a nap. Wearing only a thin inner robe, she sat up and stretched lazily.

In the sweltering summer, her clothing was light. Though not particularly buxom, she was still well-endowed. However, compared to Huaiqing, it was a tragic comparison.

As she stretched, a sliver of her snow-white waist was revealed.

Her slender waist was beautifully curved, and the two dimples above her hips were alluring.

With her maids’ assistance, she dressed in a lavish, intricate palace gown. After rinsing her mouth with tea and washing her face, Lin’an sat in a pavilion, absentmindedly fanning herself.

The palace maid who had been smacked by Xu Qi’an read a storybook aloud. During pauses for breath, she occasionally stole glances at the princess.

Compared to her previous melancholy, the princess seemed to have recovered somewhat, though she still appeared listless.

"You tell me, if the lady in the story weren’t from a wealthy family, would the poor scholar still love her?" Lin’an suddenly asked, staring off into the distance as she lightly fanned herself.

The maid pondered for a moment. "Probably, since he eloped with her."

Lin’an shook her head and murmured, "But someone told me that the scholar deliberately eloped with a rich lady so he wouldn’t have to pay an exorbitant bride price to marry a beautiful wife. A true man of responsibility shouldn’t act that way."

The maid asked, "Then how should he act?"

Lin’an lifted her gaze, her expression sorrowful. "I don’t know. I used to think he was the one…"

At that moment, a guard approached and respectfully reported, "Your Highness, Hanlin Academy bachelor Xu Xinnian requests an audience."

Lin’an hesitated for a moment before recalling that he was that man’s cousin. She frowned slightly—she had no dealings with this scholar. What could he want?

After a brief silence, she said, "Bring him in."

A quarter of an hour later, wearing an azure brocade robe, cloud-patterned boots, and a golden crown, Xu Qi’an—disguised as his younger cousin—followed the Shaoyin Palace guards into the reception hall.

Lin’an sat upright behind a table, her posture prim and proper. She instructed the maids to serve tea and asked indifferently, "What business does Sir Xu have with us?"
