# 387. Admitting Fault

_"Sching!"_

Xu Qi’an flicked his wrist, and the black-gold long blade let out a crisp hum, tracing a chillingly vivid streak of blood across the execution platform.

His gaze swept over the seven righteous men kneeling before him, over the Imperial Guards, over the sea of common folk packed densely below. He took a deep breath and declared in a loud voice:

"Today, Xu Qi’an executes two traitors—not for vengeance, not for personal grudges, but for the sake of justice, for the sake of clearing Administrator Zheng’s name, for the sake of delivering a message to the imperial court…"

Countless eyes were fixed on him. The crowd was utterly silent, listening intently.

Xu Qi’an’s voice was powerful, carrying an indescribable depth.

“If Heaven had emotion Heaven would grow old; Long and treacherous is the righteous road.”

His gaze drifted across the assembled masses before lifting towards the vast, clear sky. Amid the white clouds, he seemed to see that rigid yet dignified figure once more—bowing respectfully toward him.

Xu Qi’an returned the gesture and did not lift his head for a long time.

_Sir Zheng, may your journey be safe._

…

*If Heaven had emotion Heaven would grow old; Long and treacherous is the righteous road.* On a distant rooftop, Huaiqing, dressed in white like freshly fallen snow, trembled slightly. She murmured the words to herself, dazed.

_Long and treacherous is the righteous road… so this… this is the belief you have held in your heart, Xu Qi’an?_

Beyond the crowd, a plain-looking woman clutched her chest. She could hear her heart pounding wildly.

At the Vegetable Market, the gathered commoners began to sob. Some bowed their heads, others wiped at their tears, their grief unabated.

"Dad, why are you crying? Why are all the adults crying?"

In a less crowded spot, a young child tilted his head up, blinking in confusion.

The man lifted the child onto his shoulders and whispered, "Look at that man. Remember these words. Never forget them. And remember him. No matter what others say in the future, you must never speak ill of him."

"Who is he? Why would I speak ill of him?" the child asked with innocent curiosity.

"He is a hero of Great Feng. But after today, he may very well become a ‘villain.’"

Xu Qi’an sheathed his blade, then reached for the carving knife embedded in the platform. With a sharp clang, he pulled it free, gripping it tightly in his palm. The dozen or so high-ranked martial artists surrounding the platform instinctively retreated in alarm.

He ignored them. They were nothing to him.

Stepping off the execution platform, he walked forward step by step.

As he moved, he discreetly opened the special sachet Li Miaozhen had given him, capturing the two lingering souls within.

The crowd, packed tightly across the street, parted of their own accord, forming a straight and unimpeded path.

"Silver Gong Xu, allow this old man to bow to you."

An elderly Confucian scholar with graying hair cupped his hands and bowed deeply.

"Silver Gong Xu, allow this old man to bow to you."

No orders, no calls for unity—yet one after another, the common folk clasped their hands and bowed, their movements uncoordinated but their sincerity unwavering.

From the rooftop, Huaiqing watched this scene unfold, momentarily lost in thought.

She was the emperor’s eldest daughter, a noble princess. She had witnessed thousands bowing before her father—the ruler of the nation.

But those people bowed out of fear. Out of reverence for the dragon robe he wore.

Only Xu Qi’an… The people respected him. They loved him.

Not for his title, not for his power, but for the man himself.

The Imperial Guards blocking the road stirred uneasily. They watched the young man approach and hesitated, unsure whether to draw their weapons or step aside.

Their eyes darted toward their three commanders—only to find that the commanders, along with the other martial experts, were standing motionless in the distance, making no effort to intervene.

"Neigh…"

The warhorses whinnied softly. Their riders unconsciously pulled at the reins, parting to the sides and clearing a path.

After walking several hundred steps, Xu Qi’an halted and gazed toward the imperial palace.

_You refuse to admit fault? Then I will force you to do so…_

…

At that moment, outside the Meridian Gate, the court officials had yet to disperse.

They remained, waiting for news to arrive.

Moreover, if a battle truly broke out in the capital, then the safest place to be was within the palace, guarded by its many hidden experts.

The imperial palace was adjacent to the imperial barracks, which held three divisions, including the Baizhan, Shenji, and Cavalry battalions—comprising 100,000 elite soldiers, all directly under the emperor’s command.

Many among the generals and noble families were also powerful martial artists. People like Que Yongxiu, a fifth rank, were far from rare.

The civil and military officials whispered amongst themselves, speculating on how this incident would be resolved.

*Would Duke Cao and the Duke Protector live or die?*

Yet, despite their discussions, their eyes kept drifting toward the palace gates.

At last, a soldier gripping his blade tightly came sprinting in from outside.

Prime Minister Wang stepped forward, stopping him with a heavy voice:

"What is the situation outside? Has the Imperial Army subdued Xu Qi’an? Are Duke Cao and the Duke Protector safe?"

The soldier, who was rushing to deliver his report to the emperor, had no intention of answering. He sidestepped Prime Minister Wang and continued onward.

But several military officials blocked his path, shouting, "Speak!"

The sound of shuffling boots filled the air as hundreds of civil and military officials stepped forward in unison, crowding in.

The soldier, suddenly feeling an unbearable weight of pressure far beyond his rank, swallowed hard and forced himself to reply:

"Duke Cao and the Duke Protector were dragged to the Vegetable Market and beheaded."

With that, he hurried away.

*They were taken to the Vegetable Market and executed…*

For a long moment, no one among the gathered officials could speak.

Though they all knew what kind of man Xu Qi’an was, especially those who had crossed paths with him—people like Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law and the Chief Justice.

But hearing confirmation that Duke Cao and the Duke Protector had been executed in public still felt utterly surreal.

"He… truly is a lawless madman…" one official murmured.

"He is a detestable man." Minister Sun glanced at the speaker, then, after a brief pause, added:

"But… also a respectable one."

Several of his fellow civil officials stared at him in disbelief.

Minister Sun’s expression remained indifferent. "I loathe him, I wish I could cut him into a thousand pieces—but that is my personal grudge. Que Yongxiu was a butcher who aided a tyrant, slaughtering 380,000 innocent people. He was an unforgivable villain. His execution was well deserved. And brilliantly done."

*Well deserved, brilliantly done.* Many of the officials found themselves silently echoing the words.

Some had compromised for the sake of power.

Some feared defying imperial authority.

Some distanced themselves, choosing to remain uninvolved.

Some felt righteous fury but remained silent, bound by duty.

Yet right and wrong—each of them knew in their hearts where the scale tipped.

Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang exchanged glances.

Neither of them looked surprised, as if they had foreseen this outcome.

"Is one day enough?" Wei Yuan asked flatly.

"More than." Prime Minister Wang nodded lightly.

…

Inside the imperial bedchamber.

Emperor Yuanjing stood with his back to the door, hands clasped behind him, silent and motionless. Beside him, the elderly eunuch lowered his head slightly, not daring to make a sound.

Having served Emperor Yuanjing for many years, he understood this ruler’s temperament well. The emperor would overturn tables and desks when venting his anger, but that was merely an emotional outburst. Once it was released, he would not dwell on it.

However, if he remained silent for longer than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, it meant he was truly calculating, strategising—treating the matter like an enemy at war.

It was strange. Even when handling the Zhenbei King’s case, the emperor had not been so dark and terrifying. Yet now, after Xu Qi’an had abducted the two dukes, he seemed to have lost control.

Even if Xu Qi’an had executed them in a fit of rage, it was no real loss to His Majesty. After all, his goal had already been achieved.

At that moment, hurried footsteps approached.

A guard stopped at the door.

Emperor Yuanjing spun around abruptly, his voice heavy: "Speak!"

The guard stood at the entrance, cupping his fists. "Xu Qi’an executed the two dukes at the Vegetable Market, and, and…"

Hearing that Duke Cao and the Duke Protector had been beheaded, Emperor Yuanjing’s face darkened in fury. "Spit it all out!" he snapped.

The guard trembled and stammered, "And he—before an audience of thousands—slandered Your Majesty, claiming… claiming that Your Majesty condoned the Zhenbei King’s massacre, and that Duke Protector Que Yongxiu was the executioner."

Emperor Yuanjing’s pupils contracted sharply. A few seconds later, the hand hidden in his sleeve trembled slightly, his face twitched visibly. Through clenched teeth, he spat out each word:

"Is that wretched traitor still alive?"

"He—he entered the Sitianjian. The commanders failed to stop him because… because he held a carving knife…"

Sensing the emperor’s fury, the guard’s voice quivered.

Inside the hall, the silence was suffocating.

It was so quiet that a pin drop could be heard.

The air felt frozen in place, and the elderly eunuch did not even dare to breathe. His plump body trembled slightly.

After a long pause, Emperor Yuanjing’s emotionless voice echoed:

"Send men immediately to capture Xu Qi’an’s family and imprison them. If they resist—kill them on the spot.

"Dispatch five hundred Imperial Guards to seize Xu Qi’an at the Sitianjian. Inform the cabinet to draft an imperial decree at once: Silver Gong Xu Qi’an is a spy of the Church of the Warlock God, exploiting the Zheng Xinghuai case to stir chaos and tarnish the reputation of the imperial family."

Once the elderly eunuch had departed with the orders, Emperor Yuanjing muttered to himself in a low voice:

"The fortune must not be further weakened…"

…

Not long after, a squad of Imperial Guards rode to the Xu residence, only to find the main gate tightly shut.

They kicked open the doors and stormed in, but the place was already empty.

Furniture and household items remained in place, but anything of value was gone.

These were the elite of the elite, not common brutes. They did not vent their frustration by smashing things but instead conducted a thorough search before swiftly retreating to report back.

Meanwhile, the elderly eunuch personally hurried to the Cabinet, where he found the white-haired Prime Minister Wang seated in the hall.

"His Majesty commands: Draft an edict immediately—Silver Gong Xu Qi’an is a spy of the Church of the Warlock God, exploiting the Zheng Xinghuai case to incite unrest and damage the reputation of the imperial family!"

The eunuch spoke rapidly, repeating Emperor Yuanjing’s words verbatim.

Prime Minister Wang listened carefully, then nodded:

"Non Placet."

The meaning of these two words were: Rejected! 

The Cabinet had the power of remonstrance—meaning they could reject imperial decrees that were improper or unreasonable.

"What did you say?"

The elderly eunuch thought he had misheard. He dug at his ear before asking, "Prime Minister, could you repeat that?"

Prime Minister Wang met his gaze calmly. "Non Placet."

The eunuch’s face darkened, his tone carrying an implicit threat. "Prime Minister, these are unusual times. Why must you go against His Majesty now? You know many are eyeing your position eagerly."

After a pause, he softened his tone. "The land under heaven belongs to His Majesty. We, as his ministers, even if we have objections, should keep them to ourselves. Why make things difficult?"

Without a word, Prime Minister Wang rose and walked towards the exit.

The eunuch, seeing his defiance, was about to explode in fury when he heard the elder’s calm voice:

"This official feels unwell. I will return home to rest. If His Majesty has urgent matters, he may summon me tomorrow."

*How dare…* The eunuch trembled with rage.

He immediately had his palanquin carried back to the palace and headed straight for the imperial bedchamber.

Inside, sandalwood incense curled in the air.

Emperor Yuanjing sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, his expression placid as if nothing had happened.

His ears twitched, then he spoke coldly: "You conveyed my orders?"

"I did…" The eunuch hesitated before lowering his voice. "But Prime Minister Wang rejected it."

Emperor Yuanjing was silent for a few seconds. Then, in a chillingly even tone, he said, "Summon him."

The eunuch swallowed hard, lowering his voice further. "Prime Minister Wang said he is unwell and has gone home to rest. If Your Majesty has business, he will address it tomorrow."

Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes. His lips curled in a furious sneer.

"That old fox truly believes I wouldn’t dare remove him. If he is unwell, then let him vacate his position. Notify the officials—there will be a morning court tomorrow."

In recent days, imperial court sessions had been convened daily—more frequent than even during the Grand Examination. Ever since Emperor Yuanjing had devoted himself to Daoism, he had never called court meetings so intensively.

At that moment, an Imperial Guard commander arrived outside the bedchamber and called out, "Your Majesty!"

The elderly eunuch stepped outside and whispered with him briefly before returning with an unpleasant expression. Lowering his voice, he reported:

"Your Majesty, Xu Qi’an’s family fled beforehand. Their whereabouts are unknown. As for the Sitianjian, the Stargazing Tower is now sealed within a hundred-foot-wide formation. The Imperial Guards cannot enter."

Emperor Yuanjing sneered.

"As expected—he planned this well in advance."

After a brief pause, he asked in a hushed tone, "What did the Jianzheng say?"

The eunuch hesitated. "It was not the Jianzheng—it was Yang Qianhuan. He personally intervened… and ridiculed the Imperial Guards viciously."

Hearing this, Emperor Yuanjing actually relaxed a little.

He fell silent, calculating how to reclaim control of the situation.

After all, Xu Qi’an was merely a Silver Gong. He did not represent the court. His actions could be framed as a martial officer violating imperial authority. But that was not enough.

To sway public opinion, they needed to fabricate a charge—branding him as a spy of the Church of the Warlock God.

Then, they would spread rumours throughout the capital, aligning them with the imperial decree.

That would be far more convincing than his grandstanding at the Vegetable Market.

But before that, he had to deal with the civil officials.

Now that the situation had turned, many officials who had been afraid to speak might seize the moment to revolt.

At tomorrow’s court session, he would “kill a chicken to scare the monkeys”.

Prime Minister Wang… would be that chicken.

…

Sitianjian, Bagua Platform

The Jianzheng stood atop the tower, hands clasped behind his back, white robes billowing—his figure as ethereal as an exiled immortal.

He gazed down at the capital with focused eyes. After a moment, he smiled knowingly. “Things have been set in motion!”

At that moment, a white-robed figure appeared, standing with his back to the Jianzheng, hands behind him. With the proudest tone, he spoke the most respectful words:

"Many thanks to Teacher for making this possible. Today, I am at ease. Ahem, but what exactly happened? Why is the Imperial Army hunting Xu Qi’an, and why did you instruct me to stop them?"

The Jianzheng, in a rather pleasant mood, explained, "Xu Qi’an intercepted the officials at the Meridian Gate, seized the Duke Protector and Duke Cao, and executed them at the Vegetable Market. He has won the love and respect of the people. However, in doing so, he has also destroyed his own future."

After speaking, he glanced at his disciple, noting his impetuousness and lack of restraint. This was a good opportunity to teach him a lesson—to let him see how Xu Qi’an had set himself on a path to destruction.

"If it were you, would you dare to do the same?"

Yang Qianhuan’s body stiffened for a moment before he recovered and replied in an indifferent tone, "So that’s how it is. Ahem, Teacher, I am returning to cultivate."

_So calm?_ The Jianzheng was slightly relieved—it seemed his disciple could still distinguish between grave matters and trivial ones.

Yang Qianhuan’s figure flickered and vanished.

Then, the Jianzheng sensed his disciple’s aura streaking rapidly towards the imperial palace…

His face twitched slightly, and he stomped his foot.

Deep within the Star-Gazing Tower, a heart-wrenching wail echoed:

"Teacher Jianzheng! You cannot do this to me! NOOOO!"

… 

That morning’s events at the Vegetable Market spread through the capital at an astonishing speed. Unlike idle gossip that was only discussed when convenient, the execution of the Duke of Cao and the Duke Protector by Xu Qi’an was actively spread by those who had witnessed it first-hand.

By midday, the news had reached all four corners of the inner city. By dusk, the outer city would know as well.

Zhao Er was a hoodlum — a layabout who spent his days idly, never managing to keep silver in his pockets. If he wasn’t gambling away his money, he was spending it on the women of the Goulan.

Recently, however, he had been living rather comfortably, having taken on a job that only required him to wag his tongue in exchange for a small fortune—one cash of silver per task. It was a windfall from the heavens.

This job came from a group called the Green Hand Gang, who specifically recruited men like Zhao Er. The task was simple—spread rumours that Chuzhou’s Administrator, Zheng Xinghuai, had colluded with the Yao and the barbarians.

Today, the Green Hand Gang issued a new task. The rumour was nearly the same—only the name had changed. Now, the target was Silver Gong Xu Qi’an.

After receiving his assignment, Zhao Er did not start working immediately. Instead, he indulged himself at the Goulan, playing the role of a generous benefactor.

By lunchtime, he made his way to a well-known tavern, a place he had visited twice before—both times to spread the rumours about Zheng Xinghuai.

There was no better place for his "work" than a tavern. The Goulan was also suitable, but Zhao Er was a man who loved pleasure, and when he was there, he really only thought of…

Another reason he favoured this tavern was that it was frequented by a stunningly beautiful woman, always accompanied by a plain-looking older woman.

Upon stepping inside, he was met with the familiar din of conversation. Scanning the room, he saw that only the plain-looking woman was present, sitting in a daze, frowning deeply as if preoccupied with troubling thoughts. She hadn’t even touched her meal.

_The beauty isn’t here today…_ Zhao Er felt a pang of disappointment.

He chose an empty table, ordered some wine and food, and perked up his ears.

As expected, he soon heard discussions about Silver Gong Xu Qi’an.

"Did you hear? This morning, Silver Gong Xu beheaded the two dukes at the Vegetable Market! I never imagined… I never imagined the truth behind the Chuzhou Massacre was…"

The speaker hesitated, as if afraid to continue, yet unwilling to stay silent. He clenched his fist and pounded the table.

With that, the conversation ignited.

"To think that in all of court, with so many officials, not a single one dared to speak out!"

"Silver Gong Xu is not only a hero—he is the last conscience of Great Feng!"

"Exactly! Who else would sacrifice their future, even their life, for the sake of justice? And yet, people like him are always the first to be slandered by traitors and tyrants…"

"He is no longer a Silver Gong… Sigh, Our Great Feng has lost two good officials. Administrator Zheng was also a loyal man."

"Do you think Silver Gong Xu will be… executed?"

"Hmph! If the court dares to kill him, we’ll blockade the imperial palace!"

"That’s right! If they have the guts, let them kill us all—we’ll surround the palace gates!"

At first, only a few tables were involved in the discussion. Gradually, more patrons joined in, their voices brimming with righteous indignation.

Suddenly, a discordant voice rang out. It was Zhao Er.

He smacked the table and shouted, "You’ve all been deceived by traitors! The truth isn’t what you think!"

Interrupting at the peak of tension was the best way to seize attention—a trick Zhao Er had mastered from previous jobs.

As expected, every head in the tavern turned towards him.

With all eyes on him, he immediately declared:

"I have a relative in the court who revealed a great secret to me!"

The patrons instinctively asked, "What secret?"

Zhao Er raised his voice as if announcing something monumental:

"That Silver Gong Xu is actually a spy of the Church of the Warlock God, who has been infiltrating the Great Feng for years, building a reputation. This time, he saw an opportunity—using the false claim that Zheng Xinghuai colluded with the Yao to frame the Zhenbei King, manipulate public opinion, and murder the dukes to tarnish the imperial court’s reputation.

"You’ve all been deceived. His words cannot be trusted. Just think—why would the Zhenbei King massacre a city? Why would His Majesty ever permit it? Use your brains!"

The moment he finished speaking, a wave of outrage crashed down upon him.

"Nonsense! How could Silver Gong Xu be a spy? What proof do you have? Dare you slander him? Do you wish to die?"

Zhao Er remained unfazed.

He sneered, "The Great Feng has no shortage of heroes. Do you truly believe only one man can uphold justice? Think again. If the Zhenbei King had really massacred a city, why did no officials speak out for Zheng Xinghuai in court?

"The truth is simple. The smart ones among you will see it at a glance. You’re all blinded by Silver Gong Xu’s past glory. But he’s nothing more than a hypocrite—a Church of the Warlock God spy in disguise.

"I swear, every word is true. I have a relative in the court!"

His words were calculated, logical, and seemingly reasonable.

"Bang!"

At that moment, a wine cup flew across the room and smashed against Zhao Er’s head.

He turned, furious, only to see that the culprit was none other than the plain-looking woman.

"You wretched woman! You dare throw something at me?" Zhao Er roared, rolling up his sleeves, ready to teach her a lesson.

Yet, the woman remained unafraid. One hand on her hip, the other pointing directly at him, she shouted:

"It’s him! Yesterday, he was in this very tavern spreading rumours that Zheng Xinghuai colluded with the Yao and barbarians, and today, he’s here spreading lies that Silver Gong Xu is a spy!"

Zhao Er’s face darkened. He growled viciously, "I didn’t! You foul-mouthed hag, if you keep spouting nonsense, I’ll beat you to death today!"

Before his threat even settled, the tavern waiter, who had been staring at him for a while, suddenly recognised him. Pointing a finger, he exclaimed loudly:

"Yes, yes! It’s him! He was here yesterday slandering Administrator Zheng as well! If anyone is a spy, it’s him!"

"Motherfucker, beat him up!"

The patrons, who had already been fuming with suppressed anger, could hold back no longer. Sleeves were rolled up, and they swarmed Zhao Er, fists flying.

The tavern erupted into chaos as over a dozen men surrounded Zhao Er, pummeling him relentlessly.

"Stop! Stop hitting me! You’ll kill me! Help! Help!" Zhao Er curled up into a ball, shielding his head, begging for mercy.

The enraged patrons ignored him. Kicks rained down on him, and someone even picked up a stool and smashed it down.

The elderly tavern owner, standing to the side, shouted his support:

"Hit him hard! I won’t charge for broken tables and chairs! If he dies, just throw his body onto the street!"

The plain-looking woman placed both hands on her hips, lifted her chin with a proud “hmph”, feeling as if she had done something truly remarkable. With an air of triumph, she marched upstairs and returned to her room.

Throughout the vast capital, similar incidents unfolded across various districts.

…

Dusk.

The elderly eunuch hurried into the imperial bedchamber, passing through the outer chamber and entering the depths of the palace where Emperor Yuanjing sat cross-legged.

"Your Majesty, news from outside the palace—" The eunuch hesitated, then whispered, "The rumours… they won’t spread…"

Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes, his gaze dark and heavy. "They won’t spread?"

The eunuch swallowed hard and spoke even softer:

"Anyone who speaks ill of Xu Qi’an has been beaten by the people. Some… some incidents even turned deadly."

… Emperor Yuanjing’s voice suddenly rose: "When did he gain such influence?"

The eunuch had no answer.

Emperor Yuanjing ground his teeth. "A mere ant… and now, without even realising it, he’s managed to bite us."

…

The Next Morning. Six AM.

At the Bagua Platform, Xu Qi’an stood at the edge, hugging a wine jar.

Facing the wind, he gazed silently towards the direction of the imperial palace, saying nothing.

At the Meridian Gate, the morning drum resounded. Civil and military officials filed in an orderly procession across Jinshui Bridge. Most remained outside the palace hall, while high-ranking ministers entered Jinluan Hall.

After waiting for a quarter-hour, Emperor Yuanjing finally arrived, dressed in Daoist robes. His expression was impassive, his presence cold and imposing.

Seated upon the dragon throne, he looked toward Prime Minister Wang with a sneer:

"We heard Prime Minister Wang has been unwell lately. Then there is no need for you to attend court. We grant you a three-month leave to recuperate. The affairs of the cabinet shall be temporarily overseen by Senior Grand Secretary Zhao Tingfang."

The faces of the gathered officials subtly shifted.

The emperor was making his move to replace the Prime Minister—first marginalising him, then installing a replacement.

He would really pull such an opening move?

Prime Minister Wang bowed. "Thank you, Your Majesty."

Emperor Yuanjing no longer spared him a glance. By now, it was too late for Wang to soften his stance.

Sweeping his gaze across the officials, the emperor spoke, his words slow and deliberate:

"We are furious!

"Because within the court, there are treacherous ministers—traitors who have murdered dukes, slandered the imperial family, and defamed the court! Such wicked rebels deserve execution, along with their entire families!"

The officials lowered their heads, silent.

Emperor Yuanjing then turned to Wei Yuan and said in a heavy tone:

"Wei Yuan, Xu Qi’an is your man. You must take responsibility. We give you three days to capture this criminal and his family."

Wei Yuan stepped forward and bowed. "Yes, Your Majesty."

_So even Azure Cloak Wei isn’t as steadfast as the people think…_ A trace of mockery flickered in Emperor Yuanjing’s eyes before he continued:

"As for how to handle this treasonous Xu Qi’an, does anyone have any further recommendations?"

At that moment, Zhang Xingying stepped forward. "Your Majesty, your servant has a petition!"

Emperor Yuanjing nodded. "Speak."

Zhang Xingying bowed, hesitated for a moment, then declared loudly:

"The Zhenbei King colluded with the Church of the Warlock God, massacring 380,000 people in Chuzhou! Duke Protector Que Yongxiu personally carried out the slaughter, and later, he and Duke Cao conspired to assassinate Administrator Zheng Xinghuai…"

Before he could finish, Emperor Yuanjing cut him off with a thunderous shout:

"Bastard! Zhang Xingying, are you trying to overturn the case?

“So that’s where Xu Qi’an’s insolence comes from—you’ve been conspiring with him! Do you even understand the crime of slandering a king and a duke?”

His voice surged like a tidal wave, crashing over the court.

Yet Zhang Xingying stood his ground.

He met the emperor’s gaze head-on, unyielding, and slowly shook his head.

"Your Majesty, I am not here to overturn the case."

Emperor Yuanjing narrowed his eyes. "Then what do you intend?"

Zhang Xingying stepped forward again, as if challenging the emperor’s authority, and declared in a firm voice:

"Your Majesty has committed grave sins. First—condoning the Zhenbei King’s massacre. Second—protecting the Zhenbei King and the Duke Protector.

"Therefore, your servant implores Your Majesty… to issue a self-reproach edict!"

His voice echoed throughout the court.

The hall fell into a stunned silence. Those words were like a sudden thunderclap, shattering the heavens.

Emperor Yuanjing’s mind reeled. What had he just heard?

A self-reproach edict?[^1] 

This lowly Censorate official dared to demand that he, the Emperor, issue a self-reproach edict?

“I see you’ve lost your mind.”

Emperor Yuanjing’s rage boiled over.

Emperor Yuanjing was furious. His imperial authority, as the sovereign of sovereigns, had just been challenged by a mere ant. A mere censor dared to demand that he issue a self-reproach edict?

"Zhang Xingying, We suspect you have conspired with Xu Qi’an—murdering dukes and slandering princes! Guards, seize him and throw him into the Imperial Prison!"

Just as he finished, a figure in azure robes stepped forward.

Emperor Yuanjing’s expression darkened.

"We have made Our decree—none shall plead for him. Otherwise, one shall share his punishment!"

These civil officials always sought to push their luck. It seemed suppressing Prime Minister Wang wasn’t enough. Now, he needed to make an example of Zhang Xingying.

But the man in azure spoke: “Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict.”

Emperor Yuanjing froze. Then, through gritted teeth, he spat out: “How dare, how dare you, eh! We have personally raised you to such a position, and now you think you can defy us?”

Wei Yuan did not reply.

At that moment, Prime Minister Wang stepped forward and spoke in a firm voice:

"Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

*Another one...* The royal family and noble families shuddered. If they still hadn’t realised that this was a coordinated rebellion, then they were far too dull.

Emperor Yuanjing had played the game of power for decades—he was more keenly aware of political shifts than anyone in the imperial clan or nobility. He let out a string of cold laughs.

“No wonder you were so fearless yesterday. It seems you’ve long planned this scheme with Wei Yuan, deciding this morning to commit such a crime of great disrespect.

“Good, very good. What a Prime Minister Wang. What an Azure Cloak Wei. After years and years of fighting, you’ve finally joined hands against us.”

He slammed the table and bellowed, eyes aflame with fury: "Wang Zhenwen! You sack of old bones—how many strikes of the court staff do you think you can endure?!"

Even so, he remained seated—because he was the emperor.

No matter how powerful Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen were, if he could suppress them once, he could suppress them again.

"What else do you have? Who else have you conspired with? Show your hand! Today, anyone who dares to stand against us will be guilty of deceiving the sovereign and committing great disrespect. Drag them all out and cane them!"

The court staff was a punishment favoured by emperors when dealing with officials. This was not an empty threat. Throughout history, many officials had been beaten to death by it.

Emperor Yuanjing was certain that at this moment, the civil officials knew—if they were taken away, they would not be spared.

When faced with a united opposition, he might hesitate. But if only a handful of officials stood against him, then beating them to death would serve as a warning to the others.

Yet—

Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law stepped forward.

"Your Majesty condoned the Zhenbei King beforehand and sheltered him and Duke Protector afterwards. Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

Yuan Hong, Right Censor-in-Chief, stepped forward: "Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

The Minister of Rites stepped forward: "Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

The Minister of Revenue stepped forward: "Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

The Minister of Appointments stepped forward: "Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

The officials of the Six Ministries, their faces flushed with excitement, spoke in unison: "Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict!"

“……”

In the blink of an eye, two-thirds of the civil officials stepped forward.

Among them, some were Wei Yuan’s allies. Some were Wang Zhenwen’s supporters. And some had previously been too afraid to speak up.

The remaining officials and nobles felt their scalps tingle with fear.

Such an event had not occurred since the succession crisis two hundred years ago. In the Great Feng’s history, the concept of loyalty to the emperor was deeply ingrained—who would dare openly defy the Son of Heaven?

Yet today, it had happened.

Jinluan Hall was deathly silent.

"You… you…!"

Seated upon the dragon throne, Emperor Yuanjing’s face turned pale, as if the very blood had drained from his features.

For the first time, this sovereign, who had ruled for thirty-seven years, felt humiliated on an unprecedented scale.

He, the ruler of a nation, was being forced by his officials to issue an edict of self-reproach?

How could the dignity of an emperor be so trampled upon?

Emperor Yuanjing had ascended the throne at a young age. For thirty-seven years, he had held absolute control over the court. While his ministers fought and schemed, he remained above them all, watching as if observing a performance.

He had always been above them, looking down on them—like a man watching monkeys perform tricks.

But today, these monkeys had banded together… and were overturning the stage?

His fingers trembled as he pointed at the assembled officials, his lips quivering as he roared: "You… you… Do you think we won’t punish you? Guards! Guards! Drag these traitorous officials away—sixty strikes with the court staff!"

His voice echoed through the hall, reverberating across Jinluan Hall and beyond, rolling over the assembled officials like a storm.

The wrath of the emperor had descended.

This was the wrath of an emperor, of the son of Heaven himself. A wrath that could leave a million corpses.

And yet—

As if in direct defiance of his fury, a sound erupted outside the hall.

From the vermilion steps to the great square, hundreds of officials knelt simultaneously, raising their voices in unison:

"Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict!"

"Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict!"

The sound rolled like a wave, echoing over the palace grounds.

For a moment—

Emperor Yuanjing could not believe his ears.

He suspected he was seeing an illusion.

Slowly, he rose from his throne and gazed outside.

From the vermilion steps to the palace square, hundreds of officials knelt, their voices rising together, shouting “…issue a self-reproach edict…”

"You… you…"

He pointed at the officials inside and the officials outside, his hand shaking violently as he roared:

"What do you think you’re doing? You dare to force our hand?! Do you no longer recognise your sovereign?! You are all traitors! Rebels!"

The final words were hoarse, his voice cracking.

For thirty-seven years, he had never lost his composure like this. The few times he had acted in such a way in recent days had been deliberate, a calculated act.

For thirty-seven years, he had played the game of power, treating his ministers like performing monkeys.

But today, the monkeys had outplayed the master.

A surge of blood rushed to his chest. Emperor Yuanjing staggered.

"Yuan Xiong!" His voice shook as he turned toward the Left Censor-in-Chief. "You oversee the Censorate—tell these traitorous officials what crime they have committed!"

Yuan Xiong’s neck stiffened. Slowly, he turned toward the gathered ministers.

The ministers stared back at him, their gazes as cold as iron.

Gulp.

Yuan Xiong swallowed hard.

Then—step by step—he walked forward, bowed, and spoke with great difficulty:

"Your Majesty, matters have come to this point. Please… please do not persist in your delusions. Please… Please may Your Majesty issue a self-reproach edict."

*Thump, thump, thump—* Emperor Yuanjing staggered backwards, collapsing onto his dragon throne, muttering, "Treason… treason…"

"I am the Emperor of Great Feng! How could I be wrong? You will never make us confess…!"

His face flushed red. Then, his features contorted as he roared, his voice shaking with fury:

"NEVER!"

At that moment, a long sigh echoed through the hall. A flash of azure light flickered, and an elderly Confucian scholar, his hair dishevelled, clad in an old, faded robe, appeared within Jinluan Hall.

The Dean of Cloud Deer Academy, Zhao Shou.

Zhao Shou gazed at Emperor Yuanjing, his voice calm and steady:

"Yuanjing, issue the self-reproach edict."

Emperor Yuanjing’s face turned deathly pale.
