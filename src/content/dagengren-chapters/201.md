# 201. FOUR: I Have Deduced Who THREE Really Is

【TWO: The Inspector's team arrived in Yunzhou today. I want to know about Jiang Lyuzhong—his "intent," his character, his weaknesses, and so on.】

*What does this mean...* Xu Qi'an was shocked. Is Number Two treating Old Jiang as an imaginary enemy? No, a real enemy, and starting to gather information to prepare for battle?

*Putting aside my good relationship with Old Jiang, even if we weren't close, I couldn't reveal his weaknesses. After all, I'm part of the Inspector's team too.*

【THREE: Sorry, I can't divulge any information about the Inspector's team.】

After replying, Xu Qi'an’s mind wandered, drawing more connections: Number Two gathering information on Jiang Lyuzhong was clearly preparing for a potential future conflict.

*Was this Number Two's decision or was it supported by Yang Chuannan?*

*If it's the latter, it indicates that if things go south, Yang Chuannan might take drastic measures.*

Number Two was silent for a while, and the chat group fell into an awkward silence.

In this stiff, awkward atmosphere, Number Four, the former scholar turned swordsman, chimed in:

【FOUR: TWO, Yang Chuannan is suspected of colluding with bandits and smuggling military supplies, which amounts to treason. THREE is a scholar, how could he assist you in aiding and abetting? We scholars know right from wrong, minor details from grand principles.】

*That's right, we scholars have such lofty ambitions...* Xu Qi'an nodded vigorously, deeply agreeing.

【TWO: Apologies, I was being rash. I have no intention of harming the Inspector's team.】

【THREE: But when you asked that question, you were already preparing for a fight. Number Two, I know you have deep prejudices against the court, but you act too emotionally. Whether Yang Chuannan is guilty or not needs to be investigated.】

【FIVE: That's right, I also think Number Two is too extreme. From your conversation, the Inspector's team just arrived in Yunzhou. They just started investigating, and you're already thinking about attacking them.】

*... FIVE, you’re the least qualified to say that!* Everyone thought to themselves.

Number Two didn’t speak again, seemingly upset, as the members of the Earth Book Society all criticized her and did not support her. Even Number Three, whom she had a good impression of, was clearly taking a stand.

By now, Xu Qi'an could almost confirm that the military lady was Number Two, her handsome yet beautiful face flashing through his mind.

He sighed and wrote a message:

【THREE: Jiang Lyuzhong is a fourth-rank Gold Gong, and his intent is the unarmed fist. As for his character, there are no significant features, so there are no obvious weaknesses.】

These details were superficial and did not involve any confidential information.

Indeed, Jiang Lyuzhong's character had no major flaws. Among the Gold Gongs Xu Qi'an knew, the feminine yet ruthless Nangong Qianrou, the poker-faced Yang Yan, the cold and sharp Zhang Kaitai... compared to these people, Jiang Lyuzhong’s character was more moderate, without any obvious traits.

But this also meant he had no significant weaknesses.

【TWO: Thank you. Rest assured, I won't act rashly, nor will I harm the court's Inspector without cause. Um… I have one more question. I want to inquire about someone named Xu Qi'an. THREE, you've mentioned him before.】

*You even want to inquire about me? Are you planning to confront me?* Xu Qi'an immediately became wary and didn't reply right away.

As he was about to refuse, Number One, who had been silently lurking, suddenly appeared:

【ONE: I can give you all the information about him, but you need to exchange it with something of equal value.】

An unexpected backstab...

*Wait, did you get my permission to sell my information? Did I agree to this, and you’re selling it openly...* Xu Qi'an touched the mirror, then withdrew his hand.

*What should I do? How do I stop this?*

*Can I stop Number One? Will they listen? Number One likes to lurk and is quite mysterious. Although I have narrowed down a rough range, it still includes a lot of people.*

*And none of these people are ones I can deal with.*

*Moreover, what reason do I have to stop it?* What does Xu Qi'an's business have to do with Number Three? Why should Number Three stop it?

*Unless I reveal my identity... but... after praising Bronze Gong Xu Qi'an so much, now being exposed so blatantly... I’d be too ashamed to live with myself.*

After thinking it over, Xu Qi'an decided to wait and see how Number One would respond, and also gauge Number Two's attitude.

If Number Two was only seeking basic information, or if Number One only revealed superficial details, then he wouldn't need to intervene.

【TWO: What do you want in exchange?】

【ONE: You can owe me.】

【TWO: No problem, go ahead. I'll determine the value based on what you reveal.】

【ONE: Xu Qi'an was originally a quick bailiff at the Chang'le County constabulary in the suburbs of the capital. He had a lowly position and no particular significance. Three months ago, his uncle lost tax silver during transport and was sentenced to deatj by beheading. The emperor, still angry, exiled Xu's entire family to the border.

【But no one expected that three days after the tax silver case broke, the case was solved, and Xu Qi'an was exonerated.】

Upon hearing this, Number Five, the southern barbarian girl, couldn't help but exclaim: 【Lucky him.】

Just as she finished speaking, Number One retorted: 【No, Xu Qi'an solved the tax silver case himself. Using only the case files while imprisoned, he cracked the case that troubled the local office, the Sitianjian, and the Nightwatchers.】

*He's a talent...* The members of the Earth Book Society simultaneously had this thought.

*So that's why he could sit beside Inspector Zhang and why he could immediately see through the secret of the seedless loquats... Despite being a lecher, it's undeniable that he has a strong ability to solve cases... He’s come for Yang Chuannan and for the Nightwatcher who died in Yunzhou.*

Number Two suddenly understood.

【TWO: Got it, thank you for the information.】

【ONE: Heh, do you think his abilities end there?】

*What does that mean? Does this Bronze Gong named Xu Qi'an have other achievements?* The members of the Earth Book Society perked up, waiting for a moment, and sure enough, they saw another message from Number One:

【Recently, Number Three kept mentioning the Sangpo case. Do you know who the chief investigator from the Nightwatchers Constabulary was? It was also him.

【Before the Sangpo case, Xu Qi'an participated in a raid on a corrupt official's house. Unhappy with his superior's abuse of the official's family, he angrily cut down a Silver Gong, nearly killing him on the spot. He was then imprisoned and sentenced to be cut in half at the waist.】

Numbers Four and Five were awed.

Number Two's eyes lit up slightly, suddenly developing a great admiration for Xu Qi'an, appreciating his character.

The chivalrous Lady Flying Swallow admired those who drew their swords to help when they saw injustice. Although Xu Qi'an was a court lackey, it didn't diminish his worth.

Number One continued: 【Due to his outstanding case-solving abilities, after the Sangpo case occurred, the emperor ordered him to take on the case, allowing him to redeem himself through merit.

【This man is quick-witted. During the investigation, he also solved the case of Princess Pingyang's disappearance, which you all know about since Number Three mentioned it before. However, the Sangpo case hit a deadlock. If it weren't for you, Number Two, finding the Jinwu Guard Centurion Zhou Chixiong, Xu Qi'an wouldn't have escaped the execution.

【So, you actually did him a favour.】

Seeing this, Xu Qi'an had to step in and say something: 【That's very true, however he doesn’t know of your existence, so has only been grateful to me..】

*How embarrassing...*

Continuing, Number One recounted how Xu Qi'an exposed the collusion between the Qi clique and the Witch God Sect, supporting the Yunzhou bandits.

*So it was all because of him...* Number Two felt extremely conflicted.

By this point, she understood the whole story and realized that the Bronze Gong she met at the banquet was even more impressive than she had anticipated.

He was a formidable character, not to be underestimated.

【ONE: Besides that, Xu Qi'an is proficient in alchemy and has a deep friendship with the white-cloaks of the Sitianjian. Before joining the Nightwatchers, he was imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice's jail due to the revenge of Minister Zhou's son. However, with the help of the white-robed members and the great scholars of the Cloud Deer Academy, he left the Ministry of Justice unscathed.】

*A deep friendship with the white-robed members of the Sitianjian...* Number Two recalled Xu Qi'an's unique sabre and nodded slightly, her suspicions confirmed.

【FOUR: Wait, a great scholar from the Cloud Deer Academy intervened to save him?】

*Number Four's reaction was too sharp...* Xu Qi'an swallowed nervously, feeling a surge of anxiety that he was about to be exposed.

*Number One investigated me... This is understandable. During my time in the capital, due to the Sangpo case and the tax silver case, I became a focal point of attention in the capital's officialdom. However, Number One's understanding of me seems to be limited to after I joined the Nightwatchers.*

Thinking this, Xu Qi'an decided to probe: 【The revenge of Minister Zhou's son... If I remember correctly, the mastermind behind the tax silver case was Minister Zhou. Xu Qi'an was just incredibly lucky, as Minister Zhou's son met retribution for kidnapping a concubine from the Zhang family.】

It's reasonable for the Cloud Deer Academy, which had spies in the Nightwatchers, to know the true mastermind behind the tax silver case.

What Xu Qi'an wanted to test was whether Number One knew about his framing of Zhou Li.

To his disappointment, Number One didn't respond, seemingly accepting the notion of Xu Qi'an being simply lucky.

【ONE: The reason the great scholar from Cloud Deer Academy saved him is twofold: First, Xu Qi'an wrote a poem and gave it to Ziyang Jushi. Second, his cousin is a student of Cloud Deer Academy and has already passed the provincial examination.】

*Xu Qi'an's cousin is a student of the Cloud Deer Academy and has passed the provincial examination? Xu Qi'an had to take on the Sangpo case to redeem himself, and during that time, Number Three was very invested in the Sangpo case... He even spent hundreds of taels of silver to have Number Two escort Zhou Chixiong to the capital to hand him over to the Academy... What could be the relationship between Number Three and Xu Qi'an? And what about the cousin?*

Number Four was invigorated, feeling he had discovered a crucial point. He was excited by this revelation and began to actively think, making other connections:

*During the Sangpo case, sword qi soared into the sky, and Number Three quickly obtained first-hand information... During the ancestor worship, the Nightwatchers were guarding near Sangpo... the Cloud Deer Academy wanted to place spies in the Nightwatchers' office, and if the spy was a family member of the academy's student, trust would be assured...*

*Got it, Number Three is that cousin, Xu Qi'an's cousin!*

Number Four couldn't help but feel elated. With this realization, he knew that come spring, when he went to the capital, he wouldn't be searching aimlessly. He could directly aim to meet Number Three.

*That cousin!*
