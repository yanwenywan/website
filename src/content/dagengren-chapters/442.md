# 442. Great Warlock

Wang Simu unconsciously picked up her wine cup. Only then did she realise there was something off about it. The cup was yellowish jade in colour, with a faint tinge of red.

At first glance, Wang Simu had taken it for an ordinary jade cup, but when she held it, she discovered it was actually crystal glaze.

*It has a colour like jade, there’s blood-like crimson within…* Her hand trembled, and the sweet wine Auntie had given her tilted and spilled, sloshing across the table and onto her dress.

“Oh dear, how clumsy.”

Her aunt quickly set the wine jug and cup aside and took out a kerchief to wipe the wine off her dress.

Dragon-blood glaze?!

Wang Simu was stunned. crystal glaze was already rare and precious, but Dragon-blood glaze was an extremely scarce variety from the Western Regions, made from local clays in minute quantities.

When relations between the Western Regions and the Central Plains were close, Dragon-blood glaze was often offered as tribute, making its way into the Central Plains. It was typically fashioned into vessels or wine cups, used only when His Majesty hosted banquets for his ministers.

But now that relations had cooled, Dragon-blood glaze hadn’t been seen in the Central Plains for many years. In the capital, not even a thousand pieces of gold could secure one. Most were treasured heirlooms, only brought out for personal use.

Certainly never used to entertain guests.

She quickly swept her eyes over the table, realising every cup was Dragon-blood glaze. It was a full set, its value enough to buy two Xu manors.

Once her aunt had wiped her clean, she poured another cup and said, “Are you tired?”

Her tone held warmth and concern.

*She scolds when needed, but is this actually a matter of stance? She does take me seriously… Is this what the mistress of the Xu family wants to express?*

Wang Simu pressed her lips together without speaking, feeling a bit touched. She could sense the respect and regard the Xu mistress had for her.

“Come, try these dishes. All of them are unique to our Xu household—you won’t find them elsewhere.”

Her aunt introduced the dishes with enthusiasm, fully playing the role of hostess and future mother-in-law.

There were indeed a few dishes Wang Simu had never tasted before, and they caught her attention.

Crisp-skinned roast duck, sliced and wrapped in thin pancakes—delicious and filling. Braised lion’s head meatballs, unappealing in appearance but soft and tender, seasoned to perfection. Fragrant and melt-in-the-mouth braised pork belly…

*Though the Xu family is newly established “aristocracy”, its wealth is clearly nothing to scoff at…* Just as Wang Simu was thinking this, her gaze suddenly froze—she was staring straight at the small porcelain pot of chicken soup!

Something’s not right!

Wang Simu came from an official family and was highly gifted, with excellent taste. She quickly realised the porcelain on the table was no ordinary ware—each piece was an antique.

Antiques with extremely high collector value…

*That’s not normal, right? That can’t be normal. Who uses antiques as daily tableware?*

In the quiet atmosphere of the meal, Miss Wang was undergoing great inner shock.

Steadying herself, she turned her attention to the other women at the table. The girl named Susu hadn’t come to eat, which meant that even if she joined the Xu family, it would only be as a concubine.

Li Miaozhen was cool and reserved, neither warm nor distant—consistent with her status as the Heaven Sect’s holy maiden.

Xu Lingyin and that girl from the Southern Marches, however, took Wang Simu by surprise. What kind of eating habits were those? Didn’t they fear choking? Or burning their mouths? Were they putting on a show for her?

If children this young were already acting, that would be terrifying.

*But if it isn’t an act, how can Mistress Xu, so strict with her household, allow them to behave so rudely?*

While Wang Simu’s thoughts ran wild, the meal came to an end.

She made her own evaluation: the Xu mistress, while skilled and shrewd, was not an overbearing woman. On the contrary, most of the time she came across as gentle and forthright, like a young girl.

*What a terrifying woman.*

Xu Lingyue had inherited only a third or so of her mother’s capabilities. In Wang Simu’s view, she was skilled, but not quite a rival.

As for the youngest Xu girl, she hadn’t had a chance to test her yet.

So after the lunch, when Wang Simu saw Little Pea playing in the courtyard, she seized the chance to slip out alone, carrying a plate of pastries. She beckoned with a smile and called:

“Lingyin, come here to your sister.”

Seeing the snacks, Xu Lingyin trotted over at once.

*She really does love food—so easy to control when there’s something to eat…* Wang Simu was pleased and gently said, “Your sister told me someone bullied you at school?”

Xu Lingyin’s attention was still on the pastries. While chewing, she said with grievance, “A chubby boy stole my snacks…”

Then she declared loudly, “Big Bwother got revenge for me!”

*So Xu Lingyue wasn’t lying, someone had bullied her, and that’s why she didn’t go to school. Poor child…* Wang Simu patted her head and said softly:

“Do you want to go back to school?”

Little Pea shook her head.

“Then how about sister teaching you?”

Little Pea looked at the pastries and nodded.

Wang Simu smiled with satisfaction. She could teach the child some quick-learn material. Then, when she returned to the estate, the child would “accidentally” demonstrate the new knowledge in front of her parents.

The Xu mistress would surely ask, and then Xu Lingyin would explain how she had been quietly taught to read.

*Later, when Mistress Xu finds out, she would naturally feel grateful to me, and I wouldn’t need to seek credit…*

“Come, sister will teach you arithmetic.”

……

After lunch at the Hanlin Academy’s dining hall, Xu Erlang rode his horse out of the Imperial City and rushed home.

He had a bad feeling. Wang Simu had a strong personality and firm opinions, while his mother was someone who wore her moods plainly on her face.

If Wang Simu tried to test her and upset her mother, his mother might just blow up on the spot.

Besides, the estate was full of monsters. Lingyin, Lina, the Heaven Sect holy maiden, the ghost girl Susu, and the most frustrating of them all, Big Brother…

Xu Erlang felt he had to get back and regain some control.

He entered the residence, looked through the outer and inner halls, but didn’t see Wang Simu. He did, however, notice her two maids standing inside.

He asked, “Where’s your young lady?”

“In the courtyard,” they answered respectfully.

Xu Erlang went into the inner courtyard and found Wang Simu sitting by a stone table, looking lifeless like a wilted paper flower.

Xu Lingyin was nearby, taking a bite of pastry and then glancing at her future sister-in-law, clearly planning to finish quickly and flee.

Xu Erlang’s heart sank. *What’s happened? Did things blow up? Am I too late?*

“Simu, Simu…”

He walked over and gently shook her shoulder.

Wang Simu slowly raised her head, her eyes dull, looking blankly at him.

After a few seconds, sorrow overwhelmed her. Gripping his hand tightly, she said through tears, “Erlang, your sister’s driven me mad!”

“You fought with Lingyue?”

Xu Erlang frowned. He immediately pictured the scene—Wang Simu and Xu Lingyue having a row, Xu Lingyue tearfully going to their big brother to complain.

Big Brother definitely said something infuriating, enough to enrage Wang Simu like this. That guy was always the most aggravating with his sarcasm.

Wang Simu shook her head and looked at the unbothered Xu Lingyin, choking out, “It was her… I kindly tried to teach her arithmetic, but she- she insisted on infuriating me.”

Xu Erlang sucked in a breath, giving her a complicated look. “Why put yourself through this? Even the academy teachers, Daoist Li, Chu Yuanzhen—they’ve all been driven mad by Lingyin. How could you fare any better?”

Wang Simu didn’t believe him. “But- but Lingyue said she stopped going to school because she was bullied. And it’s true, so I thought I’d teach her…”

She seemed to realise something and fell silent.

The two stared at each other.

Far off, on the rooftop, Xu Qi’an burst out laughing like a pig.

Li Miaozhen kicked him, though she was barely holding back her own laughter.

"I... I finally understand why Chu Yuanzhen was so angry, haha, she also tried to teach Lingyin arithmetic. I can’t, I can’t, my stomach hurts from laughing..."

Xu Qi’an clutched his belly, tears coming from laughter. He finally understood what Chu Yuanzhen had faced in Cloud Deer Academy.

"Your little sister really has a black heart." Li Miaozhen said with a smile.

"Tch, you're the one with the black heart." Xu Qi’an retorted.

Li Miaozhen pulled a straight face.

Xu Erlang glanced around. Seeing only Little Pea nearby, he sat down and, bracing himself, said a few sweet nothings, finally coaxing Wang Simo into a good mood.

Then, he recalled what Xu Lingyue had said to him in secret the night before.

"Simo, I thought about it for a long time last night."

Once Wang Simo looked over, he took a deep breath and continued, "Ever since Big Brother offended His Majesty, our Xu family has been teetering on the edge.

"Big Brother wants to take the family and leave the capital. As for me, whether I stay or go is my own decision. I’ve studied hard for over ten years, and now that I finally have some reputation, I won't leave no matter what.

"But I want to wait a bit longer. When I’ve reached a higher position and built a stronger household, then I’ll marry you. I can’t have others laughing at your poor taste in men."

Wang Simo held his hand, all her grievances gone. Her gaze had never been so tender.

Before dusk, Auntie gave Wang Simo a huge pile of return gifts and even gifted her a jade bracelet she had worn for many years.

Wang Simo left with her maid. Looking back, she saw the mistress of the Xu family with her two daughters bidding her farewell. Xu Lingyin was happily waving.

Her gaze swept past the three of them and looked up at the roof ridge, where Xu Qi’an stood at a high point, nodding and smiling at her, with Li Miaozhen and the dishevelled girl flanking him on either side.

She didn’t know why, but even though she'd suffered a setback today, she could feel a sense of ease in this family. They lived within that ease.

A peaceful ease of tranquil days.

…

After dusk, in the Wang estate.

At a table laid with rare delicacies, Prime Minister Wang glanced at his daughter and said:

"You're deep in thought. What's on your mind? Ah yes, you visited the Xu residence today. What did you think?"

Second Brother Wang chimed in, "The Xu family only recently rose to prominence. I doubt they can meet your standards in many areas."

Eldest Brother Wang frowned slightly, "If you really do marry Xu Cijiu in the future, the dowry will have to be generous."

The two sisters-in-law felt a sudden sense of superiority upon hearing this.

"They drink wine from dragon-blood crystal goblets, serve food in valuable antiques, and their guards are all fourth rank experts. Every chicken bouillon workshop under the court gives a tenth of its profits to the Xu family each year." Wang Simo said blankly.

"What? A tenth from every chicken bouillon workshop under the court?"

Second Brother Wang, a businessman, was shocked. That was an unimaginably vast fortune.

"Using dragon-blood crystal goblets for wine..." Eldest Brother Wang was dumbstruck.

The two sisters-in-law looked on with envy.

Madam Wang showed a satisfied smile and asked, "What about the Xu family's mistress? With your skills, Simo, it shouldn’t be difficult to outmatch her, right?"

Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen gave a slight nod, agreeing with his wife. He knew his daughter’s abilities well.

Wang Simo softly said, "The Xu family's mistress... is unfathomable."

The Wang family looked at one another.

Eldest Brother Wang sighed, "The Xu family isn’t simple. Oh right, Father, how are the negotiations going?"

He didn’t expect an answer, as he’d asked the same question several times over the past few days, but Wang Zhenwen had not revealed anything, not even to his own sons.

"At most three days, and the result will be out." Wang Zhenwen said calmly.

The negotiations between the Great Feng and the Yao and barbarians were ultimately about present gains and future interests. Future benefits were mere add-ons — the immediate interests were what truly mattered.

And what the barbarians could offer were warhorses, iron ore, furs, and land concessions.

…

At night, in the study.

After finishing the late emperor’s imperial diary, Xu Qi’an casually picked up Xu Erlang’s “manuscript” and saw that it was a strategy against the Jing Nation's heavy cavalry.

Xu Erlang sipped tea and said, "It’s just something I muddled together."

*As expected of someone who majored in military strategy, Erlang’s writing is well-structured and clear in thought — whether it is practical or merely theory, that remains to be seen.*

After reading it, Xu Qi’an handed the manuscript back.

…

Far to the northeast, in a pitch-black valley backed by the vast ocean.

Waves crashed against scorched rocks and cliff walls with a thunderous roar, sending up white foam like snow lions and pale dragons.

In the very centre of the valley stood a hundred-*zhang*-tall altar, upon which were two massive stone statues.

One statue wore a Confucian robe and cap, with a long beard hanging over his chest, the image of an aged scholar.

A crack split his brow.

The other wore long robes and a crown of thorns, his face as handsome as carved jade, his bearing peerless.

As the first light of dawn touched the altar, the statue wearing the crown of thorns suddenly trembled.

Farther out from the altar stood a vast city, the headquarters of the Church of the Warlock God.

This city was called "Mount Jing", the mountain’s name being the city’s name, and the Nation of Jing also took its name from this mountain, atop which the altar stood.

In this era where the Warlock God did not manifest in the mortal realm, the Great Warlock was the highest leader of the Church:

Warlock Rank One: Great Warlock!

The current Great Warlock was called Sarun Agu, an ancient powerhouse who had existed since time immemorial.

Before the first Jianzheng had formally assumed his role, he had been a disciple of this ancient figure.

Sarun Agu appeared as a cloaked old man with a hood. He didn’t live in the towering, magnificent palace of Mount Jing city.

Instead, he had built a thatched hut at the foot of the mountain, where he herded sheep. Every morning, the warlocks of Mount Jing would see their great leader singing mountain songs, herding sheep up the slopes in the glow of the rising sun.

Sarun Agu removed the wine gourd from his waist, took a sip of ginseng wine, smacked his lips in satisfaction, then tapped the ground lightly with his shepherd's stick.

"Irbu, come here!"

A warlock in a robe and hood appeared where the stick had tapped.

"Great Warlock!"

The warlock named Irbu bowed.

"Have your injuries healed?" Sarun Agu asked with a kindly smile.

Irbu nodded, his voice low. "Great Warlock, who is the mysterious expert who appeared in Chuzhou? I cannot divine his origins."

"If you could, you’d be the Great Warlock." Sarun Agu said gently. "Don’t mind him — that one’s the Buddhists’ problem. The one we have to deal with is Wei Yuan. Just now, the Warlock God sent down a commandment."

"The Warlock God can now extend His power into reality?" Irbu said with delight.

Sarun Agu didn’t answer. He opened his palm. At some point, a jade thumb ring had appeared in it.

"Go and tell the young ones of Jing: within three months, sweep through the lands of the North."

After Irbu left, Sarun Agu glanced towards the distant altar and muttered:

"You're sending me to the Great Feng capital to cause trouble for that disciple’s disciple… In the Great Feng, I can’t beat him. What a headache."

He let out a long sigh.

With that sigh, the sunny skies over Mount Jing city were instantly covered in dark clouds, a storm whipped up, thunder rolled, and lightning flashed.

…

That same morning, Huang Xian’er and Peiman Xilou arrived outside the Xu residence by carriage, right on schedule.

Huang Xian’er, charming and seductive, with a face delicately carved, licked her lips and said excitedly, "I can’t wait to meet the legendary Silver Gong Xu."

Peiman Xilou held a scroll in his hand and smiled.

"The negotiations are over. Once we’ve met Xu Qi’an, we’ll leave the capital. Jing’s cavalry is perfectly coordinated and tactically strong. I’ve got a few questions I’d like to ask him. As for you, just be a pleasing ornament. Whether you can get him into bed depends on your own ability."

Huang Xian’er licked her scarlet lips and laughed. "Men rarely aren't lecherous. When they seem uninterested, it usually just means the woman’s not pretty enough.

"And the more lecherous a man is, the easier he is for me to deal with. Don’t be fooled by how imposing he is. Once I get him into bed, he’ll be crying and begging, calling me ‘granny’."

She was full of confidence, victory already in hand.
