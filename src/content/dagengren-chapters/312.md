# 312. Truly a Divine Man

Dusk. The sun hung low in the west.

One by one, members of the Houtu Gang crawled out from the tunnel—thirteen in total. Counting the members of the Heaven and Earth Society, they were now sixteen.

“We finally made it out!”

“It feels like a lifetime has passed; I almost thought I’d die in there… What a pity, though, that we didn’t get to bring out much.”

The tomb raiders, exhausted but jubilant, slumped to the ground to savour their survival. Some simply revelled in the joy of having escaped death; others quietly counted their meagre loot from the tomb, musing over the low returns on this operation.

The Heaven and Earth Society members, however, bore heavy hearts, showing no signs of relief.

Hengyuan carefully set Lina down, staring blankly at the tomb entrance. In a low voice, he murmured, “This poor monk is not even as courageous as a woman.”

After sitting silently for a few moments, he put his palms together, and tears of grief poured down his face.

His sorrow seemed no less than when his protégé Henghui had passed away.

*The impact of this experience on Hengyuan was profound, and when he advances to a higher realm, this will undoubtedly be his greatest inner weakness...* Chu Yuanzhen opened his mouth, wanting to console him, but no words came. He, too, needed time to process and calm his grief.

Hengyuan, who had received so much grace from Xu Ningyan, had been “cowardly” enough to escape at this life-and-death moment. The blow to him was unimaginable.

Although Chu Yuanzhen hadn’t directly benefited from Xu Ningyan’s favour, he regarded him as a trusted friend. The thought of Xu Ningyan perishing in the tomb was heartbreakingly.

*This shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t be… He’s a man of great fortune; he shouldn’t fall here...* Daoist Jinlian, uncharacteristically dejected, stood in stark contrast to his usual, sage-like demeanour.

He knew deep down that even those blessed with immense fortune were not immortal, especially when faced with high-tier adversaries.

Does the loss of such a fortuitous person mean my own fate is sealed as well? Daoist Jinlian thought, overcome with melancholy.

“Daoist!”

At that moment, the frail leader of the Houtu Gang approached. He looked even more haggard, his eyes sunken and complexion wan, yet his cloudy gaze sparked with sudden clarity.

“Please, Daoist, tell us the name of our benefactor. Though we of the Houtu Gang may be lowly grave robbers and outcasts, we understand the value of gratitude.

“Since our benefactor has passed, we’ll never have the chance to repay him in this life. But we wish to erect a monument in his honor, so that from this day forward, all members of the Houtu Gang will offer daily homage, forever remembering him.”

With tears streaming down his face, Qian You wiped his eyes and sobbed, “Please, Daoist, tell us the name of our benefactor.”

“Please, Daoist, reveal our benefactor’s name,” the members of the Houtu Gang echoed fervently.

“Xu Qi’an. His name is Xu Qi’an, a Silver Gong of the Nightwatcher Constabulary in the capital,” Daoist Jinlian sighed, then carefully instructed them on the exact characters of his name.

*Xu Qi’an…* The Houtu Gang members silently committed the name to memory.

Just then, Daoist Jinlian, Hengyuan, and Chu Yuanzhen froze. They heard faint footsteps, moving away from the tomb’s entrance.

There was a moment of silence before Hengyuan grabbed Lina and tossed her toward the Houtu Gang, growling, “Run, quickly!”

Daoist Jinlian and Chu Yuanzhen retreated a few steps, forming a triangular formation with Hengyuan, all facing the tomb.

The old Daoist murmured, “Leave immediately, go as far as you can; the creature in the tomb... has emerged.”

Hengyuan, far from being afraid, instead wore a look of relief, his tone relaxed, “Amitabha. This time, this poor monk will not flee.”

*I still haven’t fought in the Conflict of Heaven and Man…* Chu Yuanzhen muttered as he reached behind him to grip the sword he’d never yet drawn.

The Houtu Gang members paled in terror, their faces ashen, scrambling to flee without even looking back.

In the chaos, no one thought to carry Lina, who remained unconscious.

*These dogs…* the frail leader cursed inwardly, gritting his teeth as he turned back to retrieve Lina.

He grabbed her hands and lifted her onto his shoulder, all the while keeping a wary eye on the tomb entrance, praying fervently that the terrifying corpse would not emerge.

Then… he saw a glistening, bald head.

That bald head was drooping, carrying on its back a girl in a tattered hemp robe with dishevelled hair, forming a stark contrast that made him think: *Why not share some of that hair?*

The sickly leader froze, still bent over with Lina slung over his shoulder, and dumbfounded, he stared at the pair emerging from the tomb.

The three standing guard were equally stunned, motionless in disbelief.

Chu Yuanzhen muttered, “Is it really him?”

*His fortune had grown even more potent; had the Jianzheng’s technique to mask his fate failed? How did he escape the corpse’s clutches…* Countless thoughts flitted through Daoist Jinlian’s mind, his expression wooden as he finally said, “It appears to be him.”

At that moment, Xu Qi’an beamed and called out, “Everyone made it out, that’s wonderful.”

As he spoke, he jostled Zhong Li upward, adjusting her position on his back.

The narrow path wouldn’t allow for a princess carry, so he’d switched to a piggyback.

“Sir Xu…”

Bathed in the soft glow of dusk, Hengyuan felt the world was beautiful beyond words, a place where kindness is repaid, and the Buddha’s mercy is boundless.

He tried to control his emotions, pressing his trembling palms together in prayer, his eyes red as he softly chanted a Buddhist mantra.

“Benefactor… Benefactor, you’re alive… you’re alive!” muttered Qian You, who had begun fleeing but now turned around upon seeing Xu Qi’an safe.

Overcome with joy, he made a swift U-turn and ran back.

Though cautious and deathly afraid, this man had an admirable sense of gratitude.

“Our benefactor has great fortune and longevity; this is truly a blessing.” The Houtu Gang members followed suit, their faces filled with relief.

Their flattery made Xu Qi’an feel slightly embarrassed. He thought to himself, *had it not been that fortune prodding Shenshu awake, I would’ve turned tail and ran with the rest of you…*

When the Imperial Seal transformed into white sand andfortune surged within him, Xu Qi’an felt something within him awaken. It was the severed hand of the monk Shenshu, which had been lying dormant but was now distinctly present.

With this newfound confidence, he’d dared to stay behind and cover their retreat. Otherwise, he would have simply prayed to outrun his companions.

After all, when facing a “bear,” it’s not the bear you need to outrun, just whoever was slowest.

…

Outside the city, in a valley far from the southern mountain range, by a stream, Xu Qi'an took the water passed to him by Qian You.

*The water was drawn straight from the stream… who knows if it’s filled with bacteria and would cause stomach trouble…* thought Xu Qi'an as he gulped it down in one go.

They had spent an entire day exploring the ancient tomb, and after the final showdown with the boss mob, he had lost a lot of stamina and needed to keep replenishing his fluids.

Lina lay nearby, fast asleep. Zhong Li sat alone by the stream, tending to her injuries.

The Arcanist system was not geared toward combat; her physique couldn’t compare to that of a Martial Artist, who perfects their body. Fortunately, every Arcanist was a skilled healer, experts at wielding their talents to save lives.

These minor injuries were something Zhong Li could handle on her own, which allowed Xu Qi'an to chat and boast a bit on the side.

"At that moment, I wasn’t thinking about anything else, just that everyone should leave quickly, and that I’d take on all the danger myself…” Xu Qi'an narrated, spittle flying.

The Houtu Gang members were moved beyond measure; recalling their own cowardly flight, each one felt deep shame.

In private, Xu Qi'an explained to Daoist Jinlian and the others through voice transmission: "The Jianzheng left a safeguard within me. As to what it is, I can’t say."

*The Jianzheng actually left a safeguard within him… just as I suspected, Xu Ningyan is a critical pawn for the Jianzheng. And it now appears that this pawn holds extraordinary importance.*

Daoist Jinlian nodded in sudden realisation.

*No wonder, no wonder the Sitianjian’s girl Zhong Li would follow him…* Chu Yuanzhen glanced at her slim figure by the stream, understanding dawning on his face.

He also connected it with various other details: like why the Jianzheng had personally chosen him to represent in the contest against the Buddhist sect, or why Daoist Jinlian held Xu Qi'an in such high regard and favour.

There was also the subtle cues he had noticed when navigating the maze. All signs pointed to Xu Qi'an being far from simple, a man with hidden depths and untold secrets.

*Interesting.*

Hengyuan's thoughts were simpler: in his eyes, Xu Ningyan was a good man, and with him alive, the world was still, for the time being, beautiful.

*It’s a pity I haven’t yet had the chance to cultivate the Unbreakable Vajra; reaching the Third Rank is still a distant dream,* Hengyuan mused.

After finishing his stories, Xu Qi'an shifted his gaze to a certain "wild" Arcanist within the Houtu Gang, a white-haired elder of about fifty dressed in a filthy robe.

"And how should I address you, senior?"

"Not at all worthy of 'senior,' I am Gongyang Su," the old wild Arcanist said, waving his hand.

"How did you discover this tomb, Senior?" Xu Qi'an asked.

According to Qian You, the grand tomb beneath the southern mountain had been found by Gongyang Su, who was not only proficient in Feng Shui but also the deputy leader of the gang.

This was strange. The tomb had been buried for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years. How was it uncovered at just this moment?

"The tomb wasn’t actually discovered by me but by my master. Arcanists of our lineage almost never have the opportunity to advance. Most of us are stuck at Seventh Rank, and as for the reason…”[^1]

Gongyang Su shook his head, “It’s a mystery within our system, not something I can reveal.”

*Because you need to rely on the court; I’ve already figured that out…* Xu Qi'an sneered inwardly, refraining from interrupting as he continued to listen.

“One has to make a living, and there are only so many ways to do that. The most profitable of them, well, is making money off the dead. Since I was young, I’ve traveled Jiuzhou with my master, and every time we came across a site with good Feng Shui, we would record it, hoping to dig it up someday.

“If there’s a tomb, we’d make a fortune; if not, we’d introduce it to the wealthy. My master discovered this tomb when he was young and made a note of it. However, my master wasn’t too keen on grave robbing, saying it would go against the will of heaven and bring down divine wrath.

"And who would have thought, he was right… If it hadn’t been for your help, benefactor, I fear I’d be resting eternally underground."

*I can’t tell if you’re being honest or lying; as an Arcanist, Qi-watching techniques are useless on you… The true trigger for this event was Number Five, not me. There are very few people who know I’m a member of the Heaven and Earth Society, and there’s one prerequisite: they must know Number Five's whereabouts. This rules out the possibility of an intentional arrangement… Sigh, I’m developing Jianzheng-induced anxiety syndrome.*

Xu Qi'an sighed inwardly.

Then, recalling the mysterious Arcanist he encountered in Yunzhou, he couldn't help but curse under his breath: *Damn, all Arcanists are sly old fucks.*

*Mn, high-ranking Arcanists.*

*A girl as scatterbrained as Chu Caiwei definitely chose the wrong path; the same goes for Zhong Li.*

*Though, to be fair to Zhong Li, she might be unlucky, pitiable, and indecisive, but her intelligence is clearly a cut above Caiwei’s.*

Refocusing his mind, he asked with feigned curiosity, "Senior Gongyang, who is the ancestral master of your lineage?"

Gongyang Su fixed a steady gaze on him and shook his head. “I don’t know.”

*Now that's a lie; the signs are too clear…* Xu Qi'an feigned a look of confusion, asking, “Isn’t it the First Jianzheng?”

Gongyang Su’s expression remained unchanged as he replied, “The Arcanist lineage does originate from the First Jianzheng, but as for the ancestor of my specific branch, that, I truly do not know.”

“Probably a faction that broke away from the Sitianjian five hundred years ago.” Xu Qi'an’s tone was casual.

Gongyang Su’s face shifted drastically.

He opened his mouth, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he said, “Young Master Xu, might I have a word with you in private?”

*I don’t even have a hard drive left, so how can I lend you one?*[^2] Xu Qi'an quipped internally, smiling as he stood up and strolled along the stream.

Gongyang Su followed in silence.

Stepping on the riverbed stones, Xu Qi’an walked out about a hundred meters before stopping. This distance would ensure that their conversation couldn't be overheard by Daoist Jinlian and the others.

Although they were friends, Xu Qi’an had no intention of revealing the secrets of the Arcanist system to them. Not without payment, at least.

The footsteps behind him also stopped. Gongyang Su fixed Xu Qi’an with a severe stare, probing, “Young Master Xu, what else do you know?”

“I also know that the reason Emperor Wuzong managed to seize the throne back then was his alliance with the Buddhist Sect, which aided him in killing the First Jianzheng,” Xu Qi’an replied, turning to meet his gaze, eyes burning with intensity.

“…You even know that. Who exactly are you? You have a Master of Prophecy by your side and even managed to escape from the cursed corpse in the ancient tomb.”

“Who I am is unimportant. I’ll only ask: what role did the current Jianzheng play in those events?” Xu Qi’an went straight to the point, asking the question that had troubled him for so long.

“Heh, isn’t it obvious? Without cooperation from a high-ranking Arcanist, would the Buddhist Sect have been able to kill a first rank Arcanist so easily?” Gongyang Su sneered, his expression full of contempt, directed not at the Buddhist Sect, but rather at the current Jianzheng.

*So, my guess is right. The Jianzheng indeed played the role of a traitor back then, which led to his current position…* Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly, a feeling of discomfort lingering. He was no moral purist, but acts of betraying one’s teacher disgusted him on a visceral level.

“So, all the Arcanists who roam the land today came from factions that split off after the death of the First Jianzheng?” Xu Qi’an asked steadily, his expression revealing nothing.

“After the division of the Sitianjian, six factions of Arcanists were formed, each led by one of the First Jianzheng’s six disciples. The founder of my lineage was his fourth disciple, a fourth rank Master of Formations,” Gongyang Su explained.

“Do you still have contact with the other five factions? How are they doing now?” Xu Qi’an asked immediately.

Gongyang Su shook his head. “Each went their own way. There is no contact between us. And even if there were, why would we reach out—to form a secret society to oppose the Sitianjian?”

He gave a bitter chuckle. “The Arcanist system relies on the Empire for survival, increasingly so at higher ranks. This is why all six branches are in decline.”

*But this doesn’t add up. The Arcanist I encountered in Yunzhou was definitely a high-ranking Arcanist, yet he was not part of the Sitianjian. And these six branches supposedly can’t ascend to high ranks… There’s a logical contradiction here.*

Xu Qi’an said gravely, “I once encountered a high-ranking Arcanist in Yunzhou—at least a Master of Heaven’s Secrets. He was not affiliated with the Sitianjian.”

Gongyang Su paused, his brows knitted tightly. “That shouldn’t be possible.”

Xu Qi’an pondered, “Is it possible he pledged allegiance to another faction, similar to how the Sitianjian relies on the Great Feng?”

Gongyang Su considered this. “If so, then the Buddhist Sect or the Church of the Warlock God are the only likely options. As for the southern barbarians or the northern tribes, you may not know, but they lack the means to gather fortune.”

*Oh, I do know; Dean Zhao Shou already told me…*

*So it’s just the Buddhist Sect and the Church of the Warlock God… The Arcanist who helped me thwart the Church of the Warlock God’s plot likely harbours ill will toward me. I suspect the mastermind behind the tax silver case to be among his group, though this remains to be confirmed… Still, whether he meant me harm or not, he clearly isn’t allied with the Church.*

*So, only the Buddhist Sect remains!?*

*I knew those bald donkeys from the West were up to no good… but stay cautious; this is still just conjecture, no evidence… but that won’t stop me from dissing them.* Xu Qi’an took a deep breath, realising just how turbulent the undercurrents ran between the major factions of Jiuzhou.

“I have one last question, Senior Gongyang,” Xu Qi’an said.

“You saved my life. If I know the answer, I won’t hide anything,” Gongyang Su nodded.

“Are you aware that the Jianzheng has erased all information concerning the First Jianzheng?”

Gongyang Su scoffed, “Predictable. Even emperors throughout history have edited records as they saw fit.”

Xu Qi’an’s tone was puzzled, “But the problem is, many people still remember the First Jianzheng existed, like you and I.”

Gongyang Su contemplated for a moment, his gaze following the rapid flow of the stream as he replied, “Young Master Xu, what do you think it means to ‘block heavenly secrets’?”

“Erasing all traces related to someone… or masking something unique about them?”

Drawing on his familiarity with the “404 Doctrine,” Xu Qi’an offered an answer.

Gongyang Su looked back at him. “So, what does it mean to erase all traces?”

Without waiting for Xu Qi’an’s response, he crouched and traced a line in the dirt with his toe, then pointed at the mark.

“It’s simple to erase this mark, so that no one would ever know I drew a line here. But what if this line were magnified a thousandfold, becoming a deep groove—or even a canyon?

“And if that canyon were to run through the capital?”

Xu Qi’an said in realisation, “I understand. The First Jianzheng is that canyon—even if he’s blocked from heaven’s design, his influence is too vast, too obvious. The traces he left behind cannot be erased completely.”

Gongyang Su nodded and continued, “And, if the people closest to Young Master Xu—like your parents—had their existence erased, would you think yourself born from a rock? Would others see you as someone who sprang from a stone?

“The magic to block heavenly secrets must also follow the natural order, the great Dao and its inviolable truths. When it comes to the closest of kin, it leaves a hazy impression, though they cannot recall specific details.”

*I see. No wonder Wei Yuan said he frequently forgot about the First Jianzheng, only to remember him in fragmented glimpses when recalling information about the Sitianjian!*

Xu Qi’an hinted, “You seem to know quite a bit.”

Gongyang Su chuckled, his conscience clear. “It’s not that I know a lot; it’s just that these are the only things my lineage knows. Since we’ve come this far, I may as well share some additional secrets of the Arcanist system.

“The titles for first and second rank Arcanists are incredibly mysterious. Even my founding teacher was unaware of the names or techniques of those ranks.”

Xu Qi’an nodded slowly, “Thank you for the insight.”

Ending the conversation, Xu Qi’an walked slowly toward Zhong Li, who was at the stream washing her wounds and applying a brown salve to her swollen, bruised leg.

When the swelling had subsided a little, she pulled out two prepared sticks and tore off a strip of cloth, planning to set her own bone.

Suddenly, Xu Qi’an shouted behind her.

Startled, Zhong Li jolted, dropping one of the sticks, which floated away downstream.

Xu Qi’an stood with his hands on his hips, looking pleased with himself.

“You…” Zhong Li was a little annoyed, gritting her teeth and muttering, “I won’t come looking for you next time.”

“Alright, alright, what’s so precious about a broken stick? When we get back to the capital, I’ll get you a silver one,” Xu Qi’an said, pulling her to her feet. He hoisted his unfortunate Fifth Senior Sister onto his back and shouted, “Daoist, it’s time to return to the capital.”

In a moment, a flying sword and paper crane rose on the wind, soaring into the sky and vanishing from sight.

With the setting sun behind him, Xu Qi’an hoisted Zhong Li higher, cupping her thighs, and broke out in a boisterous song.

The members of the Houtu Gang looked up, watching the masters depart, their spirits stirred.

In the distance, Xu Qi’an’s song echoed: “The light of justice shines upon the great tracts of land…”

…

Bathed in the sunset’s afterglow, the Houtu Gang members arrived at the gate of Xiangcheng with just a quarter-hour to spare before it closed.

“Hurry, hurry! Let’s find an inn to settle down in before the curfew hits,” urged the gang’s sickly boss, pushing his men to quicken their pace.

He looked back and noticed Qian You hadn’t kept up. Instead, Qian You was standing dumbstruck at the notice wall by the gate, staring at the official bulletin posted there.

“Qian You, Qian You… what the hell has you so transfixed? Do you see some woman on that wall? What’s making you stop dead in your tracks?” the boss shouted irritably.

Qian You turned, his expression complex and hard to describe, and stammered, “B-Boss, come over here…”

The boss stormed over angrily, shouting, “If there’s no woman on that wall, I’ll strip you naked and paste you up there!”

Still cursing, he followed Qian You’s gaze to the wall.

Then, both men froze in place.

“Boss, what’s wrong with you two?”

The other members walked over, thinking there must be an exceptional beauty on that wall to leave them both so stunned.

They focused on the wall and saw that it held an official bulletin:

“In the year of Xinchou, on March 18, a Buddhist delegation arrived in the capital, intending to duel the Sitianjian. Xu Qi’an, Silver Gong of the Nightwatchers, entered the fray, broke through the formation, slew the Golden Body, discerned the Buddhist doctrine… and triumphed over the Buddhists, upholding the dignity of the Great Feng.”

Qian You stammered, “I-I remember the benefactor’s name… it was Xu Qi’an!”

“Gulp.” An Adam’s apple bobbed in one Houtu Gang member’s throat.

“Gulp…”

The sound of nervous swallowing rippled through the group.

*Representing the Sitianjian in a duel, triumphing over the Buddhist Sect…* Gongyang Su’s pupils shrank dramatically. He’d suspected that the young man named Xu had an unusual identity.

But he hadn’t expected him to be someone of this calibre.

The frail boss muttered, “I was wrong, so wrong…

“I foolishly thought he was a low-ranking warrior, but no, he’s actually the most important person there… Breaking through the formation, slaying the Golden Body, discerning the Buddhist doctrine… truly a divine man.”
