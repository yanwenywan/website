# 319. The Hidden Mastermind Surfaces

Wang Zhenwen was the Grand Academician of the Wenyuan Pavilion, and so it was only natural that Wenyuan Pavilion served as the office for him and other officials of similar rank.

Inside, Wang Zhenwen, dressed in a crimson robe, his hair streaked with grey, was diligently at work at his desk. Other civil officials and clerks bustled about, each absorbed in their own tasks. Occasionally, there was a hushed discussion, but overall, the atmosphere was peaceful and harmonious.

When differences arose, the officials would move to a side chamber to argue fiercely, trying to settle the dispute. However, in the world of scholars, arguments rarely led to persuasion—more often than not, neither side would yield.

In the end, a superior would need to make the final decision.

“Prime Minister Sir, Miss Simu is here to see you,” an attendant outside announced softly, treading carefully so as not to disturb the quiet.

Wang Zhenwen’s brush paused mid-stroke, causing ink to blot on the paper, spreading into a dark stain.

*How did she get into the palace… and what business does she have here in the Pavilion…?* These two questions flashed through his mind one after another.

Wenyuan Pavilion was situated on the eastern side of the palace grounds, not enclosed within the high walls but still under palace jurisdiction. Guards were posted outside, and no one without clearance could enter.

Even the Prime Minister’s daughter fell under the category of “unauthorised individuals.”

“Tell her I won’t see her… No, let her in, through the back door. I’ll meet her in the side chamber,” Wang Zhenwen set down his brush, clasped his hands behind his back, and, with one hand resting on his abdomen, strode steadily to the side chamber.

A few minutes later, Wang Simu, poised and graceful, entered carrying a food container. She set it gently on the table, smiling sweetly. “Father!”

Wang Zhenwen responded with a curt “hmm,” a stern expression on his face. “Weren’t you out boating with your friends? What are you doing here in the Pavilion, and who let you into the palace?”

Wang Simu smiled, unhurriedly opening the food container and carefully lifting out a bowl of fragrant fish soup. Her voice was soft as she explained:

“While your daughter was on the lake, I noticed the carp looked plump, so I had a few caught. While they were still fresh, I brought them back to the estate and personally made some fish soup for you.

“Father, you work so hard; you need to take care of yourself and drink more nourishing soup.”

Wang Zhenwen’s expression softened slightly. The rich aroma made his mouth water, and after tasting a small spoonful, he revealed a look of satisfaction, praising:

“There’s chicken bouillon in this fish soup. Truly is a delightful flavour. This is indeed a blessing for the people of the Great Feng, thanks to the Sitianjian’s ingenuity.”

Since the introduction of chicken bouillon by the Sitianjian, it had taken the city by storm, finding favour among nobles, wealthy merchants, and even occasionally among commoners to enhance the flavour of their dishes.

Wang Zhenwen hadn’t seen anything as beneficial come from the Sitianjian in many years.

Taking advantage of the moment, Wang Simu remarked, “I once heard a rumour that it wasn’t actually the Sitianjian that invented chicken bouillon, but someone else.”

Wang Zhenwen raised an eyebrow. “Someone else?”

Wang Simu smiled. “According to Princess Lin’an, the real inventor of chicken bouillon is none other than Silver Gong Xu Qi’an. The Sitianjian merely improved upon it.”

Wang Zhenwen, who hadn’t paid much attention to such matters, was momentarily stunned, taking a while to process this before returning to his soup.

“That young man is exceptionally intelligent… truly a rare talent…” Wang Zhenwen murmured with admiration, shaking his head as he resumed sipping the soup.

Wang Simu continued the conversation casually. “Originally, I planned to ask the Imperial Guards to bring the soup to you. But on the way, I happened to run into Princess Lin’an, so I came in with her.”

With this, she had answered Wang Zhenwen’s two questions.

Not waiting for him to finish the soup, Wang Simu stood up to take her leave. “Father, enjoy the soup slowly, and remember to bring the bowl back after court. Since women aren’t allowed in Wenyuan Pavilion, I won’t stay any longer.”

And with that, the last question was answered—she had come merely to bring soup for her dear father.

Wang Zhenwen smiled, his tone softening. “Go on, dear. Your filial piety is touching.”

*Father is such a cunning fox; dealing with him is exhausting…* Wang Simu felt a subtle relief, smiled demurely, and turned to leave the side chamber. But she didn’t truly leave Wenyuan Pavilion. Instead, she signaled to the maid waiting outside.

The maid quickly brought over another food container, and the pair proceeded to another scholar’s office.

…

In another side chamber, Wang Simu set the food container on the table, lifting out the fragrant fish soup with a smile. “Uncle Qian, I was out on the lake today and noticed the carp were exceptionally plump, so I caught a few and made this soup for you and Father.”

Qian Qingshu was a tall, slender elder. Unlike the stern and dignified Wang Zhenwen, he had a warm and approachable demeanor that put people at ease.

Qian Qingshu and Wang Zhenwen were classmates and passed the civil service exams together, where Qian was a first-division *tanhua*[^1], while Wang Zhenwen was in the second division before being selected for the Hanlin Academy as a junior scholar.

“When the emperor sought talent, I was but a withered branch; when he sought fish, I was but an empty valley… True delicacies indeed.” Qian Qingshu tasted the soup, his eyes lighting up. “Mmm, it’s delicious.”

Amid his busy day, he could finally take a break and enjoy a bowl of fish soup. How wonderful!

“Uncle, I recently heard a bit of news. They say that Scholar Xu was arrested for fraud on the civil service exam?” Wang Simu feigned casual curiosity.

Qian Qingshu’s expression shifted slightly as he nodded slowly. “The new Left Censor Impeached Grand Academician Zhao Tingfang for taking bribes and leaking exam questions to Xu Xinnian.

“And that ‘Ode to the Difficult Road’ poem by Xu Xinnian was supposedly written by his cousin, Xu Qi’an.”

*Xu Xinnian’s poem was ghostwritten by Xu Qi’an? And this involves Grand Academician Zhao Tingfang…* Wang Simu’s expression flickered as her mind raced, but she quickly masked her thoughts and asked,

“Uncle Qian, please enjoy the soup, and enlighten your niece on the details of this matter.”

Qian Qingshu hesitated, frowning before sighing. “Ah, accepting food makes one weak… But you must promise me, not a word of what you hear today is to leave this room.”

Wang Simu nodded eagerly. “Of course. I always keep my promises.”

…

Xu Manor.

In the study, Xu Qi'an sat behind his desk, pondering his next steps.

Taking down a Minister of Law was nothing; getting Erlang’s sentence revoked was just the first step in his plan. Now, he needed to identify the true enemy among the civil officials.

*If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.*[^2] 

*Princess Huaiqing may be nobility, but all she can do is watch the plans of the ministers; she has no real power to interfere. At best, she might have a few confidants in the shadows...*

*Duke Wei's attitude toward this matter isn’t particularly active either. He’s mainly testing my ability. If I can’t handle it and go to him for help, he’d surely assist, but I’d inevitably lose a bit of his esteem.*

*How can I obtain some inside information? Inspector Zhang is a suitable candidate, but since he’s under Wei Yuan, he’s likely watched by the civil officials in the opposing faction and may not know too much…*

As he was thinking, he caught the sound of footsteps approaching.

“Knock, knock…”

The footsteps halted outside the door, followed by a knock and a voice: “Dalang, a young lady has come to see you.”

*A young lady? Who could that be?*

*Ah, I have too many female friends to even guess…* Xu Qi’an responded, “Show her to the guest hall. I’ll be right over.”

He took a few more minutes to reassemble his interrupted thoughts, then took a sip of tea to moisten his throat before heading out.

In the parlor, he saw a young maid in a light green dress. Little Pea was circling her with ease, saying familiarly, “Sister, let’s play! Let’s play! I’ll give you some water chestnut cakes.”

The maid forced a polite smile, seemingly not used to handling children.

“Miss Lan’er?”

Xu Qi’an stepped through the door. Just an hour earlier, this maid had been here.

“Sir Xu,” Lan’er curtsied before pulling a folded note from her sleeve, handing it to him. She said in a low voice, “My lady sent this. I’ll take my leave.”

Without giving Xu Qi’an a chance to keep her or read the note in her presence, she quickly left.

Xu Qi’an sat down, opened the note, and scanned it quickly, his face turning shocked.

*This…* His expression grew serious. The information on the note was crucial—it laid out the entire background of the civil exam scandal.

The one who had filed the impeachment for “exam fraud” was the newly appointed Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong. Since taking charge of the Censorate in Wei Yuan’s stead, he had engaged in fierce battles with the faction of “Eunuch Clique” remnants led by the Right Censor-in-Chief.

By all logic, Liu Hong, the Right Censor-in-Chief, was Yuan Xiong’s main target since he was also one of the chief examiners. Yet in this scandal, the one implicated was Eastern Pavilion Academic Scholar Zhao Tingfang.

The reason was that if Yuan Xiong had directly impeached the Right Censor-in-Chief Liu Hong, he would have faced Wei Yuan head-on. Even with the pretext of suppressing Cloud Deer Academy, most factions would have stood by indifferently, with limited support to offer.

After all, even if Xu Xinnian were to attend the palace examination and enter office, the ministers would have ways to marginalise and suppress him.

Thus, the second conspirator in this affair emerged: Assistant Minister Qin Yuandao of the Ministry of War.

The former Minister of War’s family had been executed in connection with the case of Princess Pingyang. Qin Yuandao, as Assistant Minister, had been the first in line to succeed him.

However, the Emperor assigned a minor faction’s head to take the role of Minister of War instead.

With no prospect of advancement, Qin Yuandao changed his strategy, aiming to enter the cabinet by ousting Zhao Tingfang, the Eastern Pavilion Academic Scholar who lacked backing and personal influence.

For Yuan Xiong, suppressing Xu Xinnian meant not only targeting a student of Cloud Deer Academy but also the younger cousin of Silver Gong Xu Qi’an.

If Xu Qi’an didn’t want his cousin’s reputation destroyed, he would surely seek Wei Yuan’s help. Once Wei Yuan was involved, Yuan Xiong would have an easier time dealing with Right Censor-in-Chief Liu Hong.

Furthermore, the note provided by Wang Simu also hinted that the Duke of Cao Song Shanchang had stirred up trouble as well.

*On the surface, this is a collaboration between Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong and Assistant Minister Qin Yuandao, plus a few of their followers. But actually, besides Erlang’s affiliation with Cloud Deer Academy, his connection as my cousin invites all those I’ve offended in past cases—like the Sangpo case, Princess Pingyang’s case, and Yunzhou’s case—to seize this opportunity for revenge. Minister Sun is a prime example.*

*And with his connection to Cloud Deer Academy… the situation looks grim. Also, what is Duke Cao’s involvement? The civil officials wanting to meddle is one thing, but you—a crude military noble—have joined in as well? What could your motives be?*

*And why should I trust Wang Zhenwen’s daughter? Why would she share this information with me? From an observer’s perspective, Erlang is done for this time; she should be standing by, amused. There’s no reason for her to do more. That maid also acted suspiciously, delivering the note and then fleeing—could it be a guilty conscience?*

*Either this Miss Wang is a fool, or she thinks I am… But according to Erlang and Lingyue’s analysis, she doesn’t seem like a fool at all. So, am I the fool here?*

*If in doubt, consult Wei Yuan. Hmm, I’ll present it as if I found out on my own and ask him to verify it. That way, he’ll respect my caution, and even if I was deceived, it won’t matter—I’ll have shown due diligence by not blindly trusting anyone.*

…

In the afternoon, as Xu Qi’an left the Tower of Noble Spirit, Wei Yuan’s words echoed in his mind: “The Duke of Cao and Zhenbei King wear the same pair of trousers.”

The previous evening, after receiving Wang Simu’s “confidential note,” he had spent a long time contemplating it alone, finding it credible but refraining from fully trusting it.

After lunch, he sought confirmation from Wei Yuan and received an affirmative response.

The Zhenbei King has nothing to do with me, so this must be Duke Cao’s own plan. But what does he have against me?

*The Vajra Divine Technique…* The thought crossed Xu Qi’an’s mind.

On his way back to One Blade Hall, he encountered an official, who happened to be looking for him and said, “Sir Xu, there’s someone outside looking for you.”

“Who?” Xu Qi’an’s eyes flickered.

“A man from King Huai’s household,” the official replied.

*King Huai’s household…* Xu Qi’an let out a breath. “Understood.”

He immediately turned and walked toward the front gate. Once there, he saw a luxurious carriage parked by the roadside, guarded by two lines of armored soldiers.

As soon as Xu Qi’an stepped out, one of the guards came forward to relay a message, “Are you Silver Gong Xu?”

Xu Qi’an nodded.

“General Chu is waiting for you inside,” the guard said.

… After a brief hesitation, he followed the guard to the carriage, where he heard a man’s deep voice from inside: “Come in and speak.”

There was a commanding tone, as if issuing an order.

Xu Qi’an climbed into the carriage and entered the compartment.

Inside the spacious carriage sat a man with a square face, dark skin, and a bristly beard. His light purple robe complemented his piercing gaze, which was sharp as lightning.

The man made a gesture, inviting Xu Qi’an to sit, and spoke in a deep, resonant voice:

“I heard that your cousin has been caught up in the imperial examination fraud scandal.”

Xu Qi’an looked at him, probing, “And you are…?”

The man replied concisely, “Chu Xianglong, deputy general of the Zhenbei King.”

*The deputy general of the Zhenbei King…* Xu Qi’an narrowed his eyes slightly. “Shouldn’t the general be guarding the northern borders? What brings you back to the capital?”

“That’s not a question for a mere Silver Gong to ask,” Chu Xianglong replied coolly.

He paused, then continued, “I’m here to offer you a deal.”

“I’m listening.”

“Hand over the training method of the Vajra technique, and I’ll get your cousin out of prison,” Chu Xianglong said, his gaze intense.

*So, it’s really the Vajra technique they’re after. It figures—what warrior wouldn’t covet a body-refinement technique like this? The indestructible body of the monk Shenshu also relies on the Vajra Technique. Even high-rank warriors would be tempted…* 

So, the Duke of Cao and Chu Xianglong are using this opportunity to extort the Vajra technique from me…

Xu Qi’an reminded him, “The indestructible body of the Diamond Sutra is not for ordinary people. It requires a significant destiny.”

“I don’t need you to remind me. Since you’ve already mastered the Vajra technique, you’ve comprehended its essence. Just record the principles of the Vajra technique for me. Whether I succeed in learning it or not is my own concern.” Chu Xianglong then gave him a reassuring promise: “Once you hand over the principles, I’ll handle your cousin’s release.”

This guy wants to take everything I have and play me for a fool in the process? Xu Qi’an sneered inwardly and asked:

“May I ask, General, how you plan to secure his release?”

“I have my ways,” Chu Xianglong responded steadily.

“This case is highly entangled with political forces. Those civil officials aren’t likely to heed you. Don’t treat me like a three-year-old child,” Xu Qi’an retorted with a cold sneer.

“I said I’d get him out, not that I’d clear his name,” Chu Xianglong shot back, his steely gaze fixed on Xu Qi’an. “He’s just a minor figure; no one will pursue him relentlessly. I’m confident that I can secure a lighter sentence for him. At most, he’ll be barred from taking the imperial exams for three years. After that, Cloud Deer Academy’s base in Qingzhou would be the perfect place for him.”

Xu Qi’an’s eyes flickered, and he said, “Fine! But my condition is that you secure his release first.”

Chu Xianglong nodded. “Agreed.”

After leaving the carriage, Xu Qi’an stood expressionless by the roadside.

By now, he could confirm the true intent behind the Duke of Cao’s involvement.

*So, these sons of bitches have been eyeing my Vajra technique all along. They held back before because my influence was strong, but now they’re using the examination fraud scandal against Erlang to force me to comply… fine, let’s see how they plan to play this game.*

As the carriage disappeared from view, Xu Qi’an didn’t return to the Nightwatcher Constabulary. Instead, he vanished down the long street.

…

The next day, rumors about the examination fraud case had spread widely, spurred on by various interested parties.

Everyone, from nobles to commoners, was discussing the scandal as a hot topic over meals and tea. The scholars were particularly fervent in their debates. While some refused to believe Xu Xinnian would cheat, many celebrated, applauding the court’s firm stance on punishing fraud and demanding justice for all scholars.

Xu Xinnian’s reputation took a sharp dive. Once praised as an outstanding scholar, he was now branded a pariah.

However, in his cell, Xu Xinnian was oblivious to all of this, as he faced his first interrogation by the Ministry of Law and the prefectural authorities.

*Clang, clang...* A jailer knocked on the cell bars with a stick, barking:

“Xu Xinnian, come with me. The officials are ready to question you.”

Meanwhile, in the interrogation room, the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Law and the Deputy Magistrate of the Prefectural Office sat behind a table, sipping tea and discussing the case.

“Assistant Minister, why aren’t we allowed to use torture?” the Deputy Magistrate asked, puzzled.

“Order from Minister Sun,” the Assistant Minister explained with a hint of disdain. “That Xu Xinnian’s still wet behind the ears. I’ll start with a stern reprimand to shake him up, and then we’ll proceed slowly. Deputy Magistrate, I’ll need you to play the ‘good cop.’”

The Deputy Magistrate nodded, “We could also threaten him with torture. Young scholars may be eloquent, but they often turn pale at the sight of blood.”

The officials shared a laugh; seasoned interrogators, they were confident they could easily break a young scholar.

The jailer led Xu Xinnian from the cell to the interrogation room, where he bowed to the officials seated inside and announced:

“Sirs, the suspect Xu Xinnian is here.”

With that, he stepped out tactfully.

Xu Xinnian stood by the doorway, surveying the scene. Two crimson-robed officials sat at the main table—the Assistant Minister of Law and the Deputy Magistrate of the Prefectural Office.

Several additional officials were present to assist in the interrogation, along with clerks taking notes, and even a white-robed Arcanist from the Sitianjian.

*Bang!*

The Assistant Minister struck the table with his gavel, saying sternly, “Xu Xinnian, you have been accused of bribing Chief Examiner Zhao Tingfang’s housekeeper with three hundred taels of silver to obtain the examination questions in advance. Do you deny it?”

Xu Xinnian shook his head. “Utter nonsense.”

The Assistant Minister sneered and continued, “You bribed Zhao Tingfang’s housekeeper, Zhu You, through an intermediary. The housekeeper has already confessed. Here’s his testimony; have a look.”

He pulled a written confession from his sleeve and had a clerk hand it to Xu Xinnian.

Xu Xinnian read it carefully. The testimony was detailed, even including precise times for the alleged “transaction.” It appeared airtight.

“The Ministry of Law lives up to its name, I’ll give them that. Even I, the accused, find it hard to spot flaws. But I also have evidence of my own. Would you like to see it, sirs?” Xu Xinnian said.

“What evidence?” the Assistant Minister asked.

“Bring me paper, ink, and a brush,” Xu Xinnian replied calmly.

At once, a clerk brought a small table and laid out writing materials.

Xu Xinnian, shackled hand and foot, stood by the table, dipped the brush in ink, and began to write vigorously.

In a moment, the paper was filled with tiny characters. He pressed his ink-stained thumb on the page, tossed aside the brush, and said, “Please review, my lord.”

The Minister of the Criminal Court ordered it to be retrieved. Glancing over it, his expression froze, his breathing grew heavy, and he abruptly tore up the paper, pointing at Xu Xinnian in fury. “Administer punishment! Administer punishment at once!”

The Assistant Magistrate hesitated—this wasn’t the plan. The prisoner hadn’t lost his composure, yet the minister had lost his.

The officials present cast curious glances at the torn paper, wondering what Xu Xinnian could have written to provoke such anger from a dignified minister.

“Ah, the Deputy Minister sir agrees that this student can also speak nonsense?” Xu Xinnian sneered, spreading his hands. “If I were to detail the time, place, people, and exact events, with a fingerprint to seal it—would that prove I bribed some housekeeper?

“Then, Minister—no, my dear son, hear you father out? What I your father did with your mother last night, I can also write out in every detail.”

The officials exchanged looks, now understanding what might have been written on the torn paper.

“Punish him! Use all the instruments, I’ll make him beg for death!” The Minister’s face twisted with fury. 

A mere scholar had dared insult his late mother, a lowly licentiate had the audacity to humiliate a fourth-ranked minister publicly.

The Minister’s blood surged to his face, his anger roiled like boiling water.

“Please calm yourself, Deputy Minister Sir. The Minister forbids the use of torture,” an official from the Ministry of Law whispered as he approached.

“Hmph!” The Minister took a sip of tea, forcing himself to control his anger but fell silent.

The Assistant Magistrate coughed, assuming the lead. “Xu Xinnian, did you engage in cheating?”

Xu Xinnian’s voice was firm. “No. I have conducted myself with honour and integrity and have never engaged in cheating or fraud of any kind.”

The Assistant Magistrate looked to the Sitianjian Arcanist present for verification.

*This person is Master Xu’s cousin, Master Xu had come to the Sitianjian today to inform us that anything Xu Xinnian said is true…* The Arcanist nodded. “He is not lying.”

The Assistant Magistrate continued, “And the poem ‘Ode to the difficult Road’? Is that your own work?”

Xu Xinnian straightened with pride. “It was indeed composed by this student.”

The Arcanist’s voice was steady. “No lies.”

The Assistant Magistrate exchanged a look with the Minister of the Criminal Court and then said, “This case is complicated. Shall we defer further examination?”

The Deputy Minister nodded. “Very well.”

They exited the cell and moved to the side hall to discuss the case over tea.

“As expected, the Sitianjian is shielding Xu Xinnian,” the Deputy Minister muttered.

The Assistant Magistrate smiled noncommittally. The Constabulary was maintaining a neutral stance in this examination scandal, simply observing the situation as it unfolded.

“We won’t need the Sitianjian’s assistance tomorrow,” the Minister said.

“Understood,” the Assistant Magistrate nodded.

…

The next day, the Assistant Magistrate of the Prefecture Constabulary arrived at the Ministry of Law for the interrogation of Xu Xinnian, only to be summoned to meet Minister Sun.

“Please, take a seat,” Minister Sun said, smiling as he gestured.

“Your subordinate greets the minister sir.” The Assistant Magistrate saluted, then took his seat.

Minister Sun took a sip of hot tea, savouring it before saying, “The Emperor is greatly concerned about this case, and he has urged us repeatedly to uncover the truth as soon as possible.

“Now that Zhao Tingfang’s steward has confessed, we only need to make Xu Xinnian speak, and the case will be closed. Don’t you agree?”

The Assistant Magistrate sat up straighter, though with some hesitation. “But... if you do not wish to use torture, will Xu Xinnian confess?”

Sun smiled calmly. “Getting a confession does not always require torture.”

The Assistant Magistrate appeared conflicted but understanding.

Sun’s smile softened. “No need to rush. You may wish to discuss this with Magistrate Chen before proceeding.”

---

The Assistant Magistrate returned to the Constabulary to convey Sun’s words to Magistrate Chen.

Magistrate Chen responded without hesitation. “Very well, let’s do as Minister Sun suggests.”

The Assistant Magistrate hesitated. “My lord, this seems irregular. What if Xu Xinnian is innocent...”

Magistrate Chen sneered from behind his desk. “Whether Xu Xinnian is innocent is irrelevant. He’s a minor figure. The higher-ups want ‘evidence,’ not the truth.

“With evidence, they’ll have the advantage in court; with evidence, they’ll have legitimacy. The Emperor himself will acknowledge their validity. Tomorrow, there’ll be a show at court.

“If we refuse, this case will stagnate here—and your position may not endure it.”

The Assistant Magistrate nodded reluctantly. “You have great insight, my lord.”

Magistrate Chen shook his head. “It’s strange that Duke Wei hasn’t made a move... Send Lyu Qing to the Nightwatcher’s Constabulary and hint to Xu Qi’an about this development.”

The Assistant Magistrate returned to the Ministry of Law and relayed Magistrate Chen’s reply to Minister Sun.

Minister Sun smiled, satisfied. “Assistant Magistrate, after this case concludes, I’ll be hosting a banquet at my residence. Several esteemed gentlemen wish to make your acquaintance.”

…

The following day, as dawn broke, the civil and military officials passed through the Meridian Gate in silence and orderly fashion to attend the morning court assembly.

A quarter-hour later, Xu Qi’an, wearing the attire of a Nightwatcher, walked slowly down the path, flanked on his left by Huaiqing in a simple palace gown, as ethereal as a celestial from a painting.

On his right was Lin’an, in a fiery red dress, her allure captivating and her gaze mesmerising.

“How confident are you?” Huaiqing turned slightly to look at Xu Qi’an.

Xu Qi’an glanced at the horizon and murmured, “Fifty-fifty.”
