# 331. He's Come

"The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect is friends with my elder brother. They met during last year’s Yunzhou incident, where the Holy Maiden fought bravely alongside him, slaying rebels and rooting out bandits, sharing many hardships and forming a deep bond," Xu Xinnian explained, sipping his tea.

These words were from his elder brother, and his mother had mentioned it as well. Over the past year, the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect had formed a private militia in Yunzhou to eliminate bandits... His mother knew because the Holy Maiden had told her this personally.

*The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect had developed a deep connection with Silver Gong Xu...* Wang Simu's face brightened in realization, and she let out a soft sigh of relief. Her face then relaxed into a gentle smile as she said, "I heard from a guest scholar at my manor that the Holy Maiden Li Miaozhen of the Heaven Sect possesses a fourth rank cultivation. Since Chu Yuanzhen has dueled with her, his strength must be comparable. In the capital, there are only a handful so young at fourth rank."

*Chu Yuanzhen isn’t exactly young…* Xu Xinnian nodded and said, "The two protagonists of the Conflict of Heaven and Man are truly dragons among men."

Wang Simu followed up smoothly, "However, in a few more years, Silver Gong Xu will surely stand on equal footing with them. After the duel, people in the capital have been saying that Silver Gong Xu’s talent is no less than the Zhenbei King’s."

Xu Xinnian raised his chin slightly, speaking with a tone of detached ease, "My brother's cultivation is still lacking; these rumours are just flattery meant to harm."

*He seems very proud... Indeed, flattering Xu Qi'an was a good way to gain favour with Xu Cijiu…* Wang Simu analyzed inwardly.

The carriage moved slowly, and as they reached the city gate of the Inner City, they happened to encounter the retinue of Huaiqing and Lin'an. Two carriages, made of precious nanmu wood, had stopped at the gate.

“Your Highness, isn't that Miss Wang’s carriage?”

The maid, who had lifted the curtain to look outside, spotted Wang Simu's carriage and excitedly turned to tell Lin'an.

“It really is Simu’s carriage.” Lin'an leaned forward to confirm and smiled broadly. “Go inform her to come over. I want to ride together.”

The maid immediately raised her voice and called out.

On the other side, inside the carriage, Wang Simu heard the shout and, surprised, lifted the curtain. She saw that on the yellow silk canopy of the opposite carriage, crafted from nanmu wood, were embroidered the characters for "Lin'an."

She immediately responded with a smile, "Princess Lin'an."

Lin'an pushed aside the maid, lifted the curtain with her delicate hand, and said cheerfully, "Sister Simu, are you also going to the Wei River to watch the Conflict of Heaven and Man?"

Wang Simu sweetly replied with an "Mm."

Lin'an's joy grew, her peach blossom eyes curved into crescent moons, and she waved her small hand, "Come, join us in our carriage."

Wang Simu was about to respond, but suddenly her brow furrowed, and she covered her mouth with a silk handkerchief, coughing a few times.

Lin'an asked with concern, "What’s wrong?"

Wang Simu said helplessly, "I caught a cold a few days ago. I've taken several doses of medicine, and it’s mostly gone. However, even if it's just a lingering trace, it wouldn't do to pass it to Your Highness."

Lin'an's face fell with disappointment, and she urged Miss Wang to take good care of herself.

Wang Simu responded with a smile. Just then, she noticed that the carriage in front of them had its window curtains suddenly lifted. A pair of clear eyes, as deep as a cold pool, gave her a detached glance.

In that instant, Wang Simu felt as if all her hidden thoughts and schemes had been seen through.

Forcing a smile, she lowered the curtain.

After the carriage had driven some distance, Wang Simu let out a sigh of relief, patted her chest, and said to Xu Xinnian, "I'm most uneasy in the company of Her Highness Huaiqing; she is too clever."

Xu Xinnian chuckled.

A clear conscience and firm resolve allow one to face any situation calmly. Even if one's inner thoughts are perceived, it doesn't matter.

This was something Xu Erlang had learned through multiple instances of social death, honing his cunning.

Life was the best teacher.

The two nanmu wood carriages waited at the city gate for a long time until finally, a contingent of eight Gold Gongs arrived, leading over a dozen Silver Gongs and more than thirty Bronze Gongs, all riding in neat formation.

The last Gold Gong was on duty at the constabulary these few days, and couldn't leave.

Seeing the arrival of the Nightwatchers, Lin'an showed a look of realisation. She had always felt that there were too few guards to ensure her and Huaiqing's safety in a crowd of all sorts of people.

Out of trust for Huaiqing, Lin'an hadn't brought up this concern.

*With so many Gold and Silver Gongs accompanying us, even if we faced an army, Huaiqing and I would be safe.* Lin'an’s heart settled, feeling much more at ease.

Huaiqing lifted the curtain and scanned the Nightwatchers. She frowned, "Where is Xu Ningyan?"

Jiang Lyuzhong shook his head and said with a wry smile, "That boy's attendance is irregular; most of the time, he's nowhere to be found. Who knows what he's up to now?"

Huaiqing nodded, lowered the curtain, and the procession began moving. After traveling half an hour along the official road, the carriages came to a slow stop.

“Your Highness, we can only proceed on foot from here.”

The chief guard reported.

Huaiqing and Lin'an each emerged from their carriages, both dressed in fitted outfits. The former's ample chest and curvaceous figure highlighted her feminine charm.

The latter had tied a cloud-patterned ribbon around her slender waist, making her movements seductive and alluring. Though she did nothing provocative, she still appeared more bewitching than her elder sister, Huaiqing.

Under the protection of the Nightwatchers and palace guards, Huaiqing and Lin'an left the official road and walked into a field overgrown with wild grass. After a quarter of an hour, Lin'an’s trousers and little boots were covered with dew and grass fragments.

"So many people..."

Lin'an suddenly stopped and exclaimed in surprise.

The Wei River, two hundred feet wide, would swell to three hundred during the rainy season. At this moment, both banks of the river were crowded with people, from jianghu martial artists to common folk from the capital.

There were also idle aristocratic sons, officials who had taken leave to witness the Conflict of Heaven and Man, and nobles from the elite class.

Naturally, students from the Imperial Academy and Cloud Deer Academy were present, along with noble ladies like Wang Simu.

These people each brought dozens of guards, arrogantly clearing the area to claim exclusive spots.

"Clear the area," Huaiqing ordered, choosing a prime location for her entourage.

"Another big shot has arrived."

"That woman is so beautiful... Wow, she has so many Gold Gongs guarding her?!"

The displaced martial artists, accustomed to such treatment, cursed under their breath as they moved to another area, gossiping about Huaiqing's identity.

"She is the Eldest Princess of our Great Feng, titled Princess Huaiqing," said a local from the capital.

"Oh, I remember now, she was sitting in the imperial pavilion during the contest."

"Our Great Feng’s princess is such a stunning beauty! Has she married yet? Who is her consort?"

"None of the four princesses in the royal family have married yet; they are all still waiting to be wed. The one beside her is the Second Princess, Lin’an. Personally, I think Princess Lin’an is..."

He initially wanted to comment further, but seeing the Gold Gongs with their keen senses, possibly overhearing the conversation, he shut his mouth, not daring to gossip about the princesses.

Lin’an, scanning the crowd left and right, furrowed her brows and asked, “Where is running dog? Huaiqing, where’s running dog?”

Huaiqing ignored her.

"Move aside, move aside…"

Just then, a loud shout echoed. Lin’an and Huaiqing turned to see several armored soldiers, wielding scabbarded swords, clearing the crowd.

The soldiers escorted a woman wearing a veiled hat. The hat had a light gauze drape, and beneath it, another veil concealed her face. Even a martial expert with profound skills couldn’t see through the double layers to discern her true appearance.

“The Princess Consort has arrived. Let’s go and greet her,” Lin’an suggested to Huaiqing.

Huaiqing turned her face away with disdain.

The Gold Gongs all turned their heads, scrutinizing the Princess Consort surrounded by guards, their eyes brimming with curiosity. The Zhenbei King Consort was renowned as the most beautiful woman in Great Feng, yet her true visage was rarely seen. Even the Gold Gongs present, who had encountered her before, had always found her appearance heavily guarded, never glimpsing her face.

“She’s here, too. Last time, even the Buddhist contest didn’t attract the Princess Consort,” Jiang Lyuzhong remarked.

“The Buddhist contest was too mysterious to be of interest. The Heaven Sect and Human Sect's ‘Conflict of Heaven and Man,’ however, happens only once every sixty years. With a month’s buildup, no one can resist the curiosity,” Zhang Kaitai replied.

At this moment, it was still only six. In another three-quarters of an hour, the Conflict of Heaven and Man would begin.

Along the banks of the Wei River, thousands of people had gathered, eagerly anticipating the upcoming battle. The commoners’ expressions were festive, as if they were attending a fayre.

On the outskirts of the crowd, temporary shelters were set up, selling tea and early meals at prices even higher than those found in the inner city.

The Jianghu folk looked eager and excited. The Conflict of Heaven and Man was a grand event for the martial world of the Great Feng, second only to the great Martial Arts Tournament held every thirteen years.

"Hey, look! Liu Yun from the Shuangdao Sect has arrived. Isn't the person beside her the Sect Master, Cheng Hensheng?" someone called out.

Following the voice, people turned to see a group of Jianghu figures dressed in martial attire approaching. Their defining characteristic was the two curved sabres they carried on their backs, and their sun-darkened skin and sharp features.

Among them was a particularly beautiful young woman with a wheat-coloured complexion. Her eyes were lively and sharp, like a sleek female leopard exuding raw wildness.

She followed behind a middle-aged man, whose restrained aura seemed less sharp than the juniors trailing him.

...

“The people from Luya Sword Pavilion are here too. Butterfly Sword Lan Caiyi is indeed beautiful—truly living up to her reputation.”

“What’s the Sect Master Lan Huan’s current rank? I heard rumours last year that he advanced to a fourth rank martial artist.”

“I spotted Miss Rongrong from the Wanhua Tower—ha! She’s truly a seductive little enchantress.”

“Aren’t those monks from the Azure Dragon Temple?”

As the time for the duel approached, more and more experts from various Jianghu sects arrived. Unlike wandering cultivators, these figures were “big names” with territory and fame.

Lan Huan, the Sect Master of Luya Sword Pavilion, picked a prime location with a good view. He then glanced at the Shuangdao Sect Master not far away, cupped his hands, and said:

“They say the Sect Master of the Shangdao Sect possesses unfathomable skill. Seeing you today, the rumours are well-deserved.”

A typical opening pleasantry.

The dark-skinned, stern Shuangdao Sect Master returned the gaze and replied coolly, “Hall Leader Lan is too kind. I’m not as capable as you.”

He was still not at the fourth rank level.

*What? The Sect Master of the Shuangdao Sect is inferior to the Sect Master of Luya Sword Pavilion?*

The surrounding Jianghu figures perked up, thrilled to have discovered a juicy piece of gossip. This “insider information” would make for excellent bragging material in future conversations with friends and acquaintances.

Lan Caiyi, with her sweet appearance and lively demeanor, met the gaze of Liu Yun, the wheat-skinned female warrior of the Shuangdao Sect. Their eyes locked briefly, and Lan Caiyi proudly puffed out her chest.

Liu Yun narrowed her eyes disdainfully and looked away.

Lan Huan continued, “Sect Master, regarding the Heaven Sect and Human Sect duel, which side do you think has the better odds?”

“The Heaven Sect and Human Sect have been rivals for thousands of years, with victories and defeats on both sides. It's not for us to decide who is superior. However, between Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen, I believe Chu Yuanzhen has the upper hand,” said the Shuangdao Sect Master.

“Why so?” Lan Huan asked with a smile.

“Six years ago, Chu Yuanzhen was already praised by Wei Yuan as the best swordsman in the capital, while Li Miaozhen was not yet of age. Based on that alone, Chu Yuanzhen already surpasses Li Miaozhen,” the Sect Master explained.

Lan Huan, however, had a different view. “You might not be aware, but Chu Yuanzhen is only an honourary disciple of the Human Sect, following the path of the martial artist. He practices the swordsmanship of the Human Sect.

“There’s something flawed in his approach, while Li Miaozhen is the orthodox Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect.”

*So there were these hidden details…* The spectators devoured every word with relish.

Suddenly, a capital local shouted, “How do these two compare to our Silver Gong Xu?”

Lan Huan only smiled and said nothing.

The Shuangdao Sect Master gave a mocking snort.

“Hey, you two fools, what’s the meaning of this?” The capital locals were annoyed.

Butterfly Sword Lan Caiyi surveyed the crowd and answered in a crisp voice:

“Although Silver Gong Xu is a rare talent, with potential akin to the Zhenbei King’s, he is still only a Seventh rank martial artist. The two protagonists of the Conflict of Heaven and Man, on the other hand, are both fourth rank. Many years ago, the Human Sect’s disciple Chu Yuanzhen could already contend closely with a fourth rank Gold Gong, though he was defeated. Now, after all these years, his abilities are likely no weaker than any fourth rank.

“Li Miaozhen wouldn’t have dared to set a challenge at the capital if she weren’t also fourth rank.”

The capital locals might not understand the intricacies of cultivation, but they grasped the basic ranking distinctions. The hero they admired, Silver Gong Xu, was merely Seventh rank? And the two main contenders of the Conflict of Heaven and Man were clearly fourth rank experts.

“You’re talking nonsense! How dare you slander Sir Xu—everyone, throw stones at her!”

“That girl may look pretty, but she’s got a foul mouth, _ptui_...”

The common folk were sorely disappointed, their disappointment swiftly turning to anger, directed at the Butterfly Sword, Lan Caiyi.

“Hmph, Running Dog is clearly already a sixth-rank!” Biaobiao spat.

She felt uneasy. In Lin'an’s view, her Running Dog was a great hero, who had stood alone against thousands of rebels in Yunzhou and defeated a Buddhist Arhat in front of the Stargazing Tower.

These were feats only someone of great stature could accomplish.

She had always believed that her Running Dog was the most exceptional. But now, hearing others compare and analyse, she was suddenly confronted with the fact that his rank was only seventh-rank.

This stark realization left her feeling rather discontented.

“In the capital of the Great Feng, there are fewer than five individuals of the younger generation with a fourth-rank cultivation,” a black-robed Jianghu guest stated gravely.

“Indeed, Sir Xu will undoubtedly reach the fourth rank, but he is still too young at present. The gap between him and Chu Yuanzhen or Li Miaozhen is quite significant,” another Jianghu expert added.

Bang!

A stone flew and shattered against an invisible barrier.

The Jianghu man’s face darkened with rage, but he dared not retaliate. This was the capital, surrounded by dignitaries and skilled officials. If he dared to harm civilians, he would surely face severe punishment from the authorities.

“Rubbish! Sir Xu cleaved through a Golden Body with a single strike—what courage and might! How could he possibly be only seventh-rank?”

“Exactly! If Chu Yuanzhen is so great, why doesn’t he join the duel and shatter that monk’s Golden Body?”

“In my eyes, among the younger generation of the capital, only Sir Xu is the finest. You Jianghu bumpkins are just jealous of his glory.”

A chorus of curses rose, the common folk fiercely defending Sir Xu. Yet, as the insults piled on, they noticed that no Jianghu figures spoke in Silver Gong Xu’s favor, nor did any officials or Nightwatchers say a word. Gradually, they began to accept the reality of the situation, and a wave of deep disappointment washed over them.

Just then, the wind above suddenly howled, and a figure flew by on a sword, hovering over the Wei River.

The figure was clad in azure robes, his face fair and refined. Though young, a strand of white hair hanging over his forehead hinted at a life of trials and hardships.

“Chu Yuanzhen!”

A joyous cry rose from the crowd below.

As the voice faded, another whistle pierced the air. In the distance, a woman also flew on her sword, stopping opposite Chu Yuanzhen.

The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect was dressed in a simple Daoist robe, her hair tied with a blackwood hairpin. Her oval face was pale and elegant, her eyes deep and clear, and her lips delicate and thin. She was just as the rumors described—a beauty that captured the gaze of all who saw her.

Witnessing this scene, the commoners who had been infuriated moments earlier suddenly fell silent.

To fly on a sword and stand suspended in the air—these were the feats of immortals, only told in storybooks and by storytellers. In comparison, Silver Gong Xu’s travel by horse seemed far less impressive.

“Let’s give our all in today’s fight,” Li Miaozhen said, her eyes fixed on the azure-clad swordsman before her.

“Alright,” Chu Yuanzhen nodded.

A duel between Daoist Leaders was their concern alone. The current Conflict of Heaven and Man was a matter between them.

Chu Yuanzhen understood that if Luo Yuheng failed to break through to the first rank, the Conflict of Heaven and Man would have little chance of victory. If he chose to back down from this duel, the Human Sect would still send another disciple.

Rather than see them lose face to Li Miaozhen, he preferred to take on the challenge himself. At the very least, they could seize the advantage in the first three moves.

It would also repay the debt he owed the Human Sect for imparting the sword to him.

“Everyone, retreat one hundred feet!” Chu Yuanzhen’s voice rang out.

The banks of the Wei River filled with the rustling sound of the crowd stepping back.

The Conflict of Heaven and Man was on the verge of erupting. Countless eyes were trained on the two figures suspended in mid-air, tense with excitement.

Suddenly, a melodious tune arose—clear and far-reaching, echoing above the Wei River and the fields touched by the first light of dawn.

The music was so jarringly out of place that it disrupted Chu Yuanzhen’s and Li Miaozhen’s rhythm, causing their rising momentum to abruptly deflate.

Chu Yuanzhen saw Li Miaozhen’s face freeze, and he couldn't resist glancing back... only to have his own expression stiffen as well.

Following the sound, the onlookers saw a black-sailed boat drifting closer, a tall young man standing proudly at the bow. He leaned on a sabre, his gaze distant as he looked upon the rippling river, his expression enigmatic.

He had arrived, approaching slowly and deliberately, accompanied by his own original backing track.
