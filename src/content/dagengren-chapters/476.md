# 476. He was Smiling

The autumn wind was fierce, howling as it swept across the Bagua Platform.

Prime Minister Wang seemed to sway slightly in the wind.

After a long while, he opened his mouth and let out a hoarse voice: “King Huai was involved in the massacre of the city too, wasn’t he?”

The Jianzheng gave no reply. His silence was tacit confirmation.

The face of this man, now past fifty, gradually turned pale, his eyes ashen and lifeless.

“Why did you never stop him?” Prime Minister Wang asked hoarsely.

“This nation belongs to him, doesn’t it?” the Jianzheng replied with a smile.

Prime Minister Wang was at a loss for words. His eyes were full of confusion and bewilderment. It was precisely because the nation belonged to that man that it was so incomprehensible.

Until he stepped into the Stargazing Tower and had this conversation, he had still harboured doubts about his own suspicions.

The Jianzheng added, “But this nation also belongs to the common people.”

After saying this, he said no more.

Prime Minister Wang walked to the edge of the Bagua Platform and gazed towards the palace, his eyes filled with grief, anger, confusion, sorrow, and disappointment.

*Your Majesty, why have you rebelled?!*

Prime Minister Wang bowed again, but this time he asked no questions. He simply turned and left.

…

Stargazing Tower, seventh floor.

In the bedroom, Xu Qi’an lay half-dead beside the bed, while a white-robed arcanist was changing his bandages.

Song Qing stood nearby with several white-robed arcanists who all admired Young Master Xu.

“Ah, are- are his injuries that serious?”

“With such severe wounds, even if he recovers, there’ll be lasting damage.”

“Why don’t we just find a new body for Young Master Xu? I think that’d be quite interesting.”

“And leave this body for Senior Brother Song to use in alchemical experiments?”

“Young Master Xu has always been obsessed with alchemy. I’m sure he’d be more than willing to give himself to the cause.”

The white-robed arcanists whispered among themselves.

*Are you demons?!* Li Miaozhen’s eyes widened, nearly drawing her sword to chase them out.

Song Qing raised his hand to quiet his junior brothers and scolded them with some irritation: “Nonsense. How can we use Young Master Xu’s body for experiments? At the very least, we should ask his opinion. It’s a basic courtesy.”

“Out, get out!”

Li Miaozhen spat angrily and drove away the annoying arcanists.

“Not a single one of the Jianzheng’s disciples is normal.”

She grumbled to Chu Caiwei by the table.

Chu Caiwei nodded in heartfelt agreement. “Among the few personal disciples of our teacher, I’m the smartest and most normal.”

*And what makes you so confident?* Li Miaozhen gave her a look.

…

The Imperial Palace.

In the lavish bedchamber, the old eunuch was vividly recounting the rumours circulating among the people.

“Out in the streets? They’re all talking about Xu… Xu Qi’an that bastard. Some say he killed a hundred thousand enemies, others say one hundred and fifty thousand. Some even say two hundred thousand. There are even those claiming five hundred thousand elite soldiers.”

The eunuch’s voice was soft: “That’s the power of rumour, isn’t it? Doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad, spread it long enough, and it becomes the truth. Still, as hateful and damnable as Xu Qi’an is, he’s not entirely useless.”

Emperor Yuanjing glanced at the grand companion, whose face barely concealed his glee, and said impassively:

“Summon Yuan Xiong and Qin Yuandao.”

The old eunuch was perceptive. Seeing that the Emperor was displeased, he quickly withdrew.

Emperor Yuanjing’s face twitched violently. He drew in a deep breath, suppressing the towering rage in his chest.

How feeble were the Church of the Warlock God? Eighty thousand elite troops suffering heavy losses at the hands of one young man, and even the two main generals dying by his hand, one after the other.

If the provinces of Xiangzhou, Jingzhou, and Yuzhou could not be massacred, then the Great Feng’s fortune would remain intact, and his grand plan would fail.

“Wei Yuan oh Wei Yuan… it seems fate intends for your name to be reviled for all eternity after death!”

Emperor Yuanjing murmured darkly.

An hour later, the old eunuch returned to report, “Your Majesty, Qin Yuandao and Yuan Xiong await outside.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded. “Let Qin Yuandao in first.”

“Yes!”

The eunuch withdrew and shortly returned with the Deputy Minister of War, Qin Yuandao.

“You’ve done well.”

Emperor Yuanjing sat behind a desk draped in yellow silk and looked down at Qin Yuandao.

He didn’t specify what it was about, but both ruler and minister understood.

Emperor Yuanjing continued, “The Grand Academicians of the Cabinet are the backbone of the nation. I’ve considered this for some time and believe that you, Lord Qin, are the best choice.”

“Your Majesty praises me too highly. Your servant dare not accept such honour.”

Emperor Yuanjing waved his hand. “There’s no need to decline, Lord Qin. Once the matter of Wei Yuan is settled, the situation at court must also change.”

Qin Yuandao bowed deeply. “To receive the emperor’s salary is to bear his burdens. Easing Your Majesty’s worries is the duty of a loyal minister.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded in satisfaction. “You may go.”

Then he turned to the old eunuch. “Summon Yuan Xiong.”

Soon, Yuan Xiong entered the imperial study.

The Emperor’s expression turned cold again as he said indifferently:

“They say that to serve in office, the most important thing is not serving the nation, the emperor, or the people, but the words ‘blend in with the dust.’ Yuan Xiong, the Right Censor-in-Chief, understands this well.”

Yuan Xiong was shocked. He dropped to his knees and cried out, “This humble official acknowledges his guilt!”

The Emperor gave a cold snort. “Oh? What guilt is that? Why don’t you tell us?”

A veteran of the bureaucracy, Yuan Xiong knew full well that serving an emperor was like walking on thin ice. In a state of panic, he replied, “Failing to ease Your Majesty’s burdens is your servant's greatest sin.”

Only then did the Emperor’s expression soften. He said:

“Now that Wei Yuan has fallen in battle at the Church of the Warlock God’s headquarters in Mount Jing City, the Nightwatchers cannot be left leaderless. Someone is needed to command the Nightwatchers and the Censorate. I had originally intended for Lord Yuan to take the role.”

Yuan Xiong could almost hear the thunderous pounding of his own heart. Waves of emotion surged within him, but outwardly he remained calm, giving no sign, and bowed:

“This humble official would give his life for Your Majesty without hesitation.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded and asked, “What’s Lord Yuan's view on the war in the northeast?”

Yuan Xiong answered boldly, “I await Your Majesty’s guidance!”

…

The next day, court assembly proceeded as usual.

For the past three days, the court had been actively discussing the aftermath of the war. But the ministers all knew that the real matter had yet to begin.

This campaign, named as support for the Yao and barbarians in attacking the Church of the Warlock God, still needed to be officially defined.

Once that definition was established, it could be announced to the realm and give the people an explanation. Historians would then know how to record it, whether in praise or condemnation.

Emperor Yuanjing had delayed this. Some shrewd veterans of the court had already begun to sense something.

The Emperor was waiting for someone to speak out with a differing opinion.

But this was a dangerous topic. Whoever raised it first would bear the brunt of public condemnation.

What scholar-official didn’t cherish his own reputation?

This was not an ordinary factional struggle. If handled poorly, it could brand one as a treacherous official and lead to dismissal, demotion, or worse, the histories would remember it forever.

Before dawn, the officials entered one by one through the side gate of the Meridian Gate, crossed the Jinshui Bridge, and entered Jinluan Hall.

Rows of gilded dragon-shaped candle holders lit up the resplendent hall.

The officials stood waiting in the hall. After a quarter of an hour, Emperor Yuanjing appeared, clad in imperial yellow robes.

After discussing some matters of post-war recovery, the Minister of Revenue stepped forward and said:

“Your Majesty, the matter of compensation should not be delayed any further. Please make a swift decision, to give the people an answer, and to bring comfort to the families of the fallen.”

This time, Emperor Yuanjing did not avoid the subject. He looked down at the assembled officials and said slowly, “What do my lords all think?”

Censor Zhang Xingying stepped forward and declared loudly: “Your Majesty, Duke Wei conquered the headquarters of the Church of the Warlock God and razed Mount Jing City. He has set a precedent in the history of the Central Plains. Your servant earnestly request Your Majesty to posthumously grant him the title of First-Rank National Duke, Duke of Wei, with the honorary title Zhongwu.”

This was the highest honour since Emperor Wuzong.

First-Rank Duke of Wei was the highest noble title.

“Zhongwu” was the highest posthumous title for a military general.

Had Wei Yuan been a scholar-official rising from the imperial examination, Zhang Xingying might have dared to request the title “Wenzheng” instead.

The ministers looked at each other in silence. For once, there was no opposition, even from old political rivals.

Had this been in the past, the civil officials would certainly have jumped up to object.

But now, there was no need.

First of all, Wei Yuan’s achievements were worthy of such honours. Second, when a man died, it was as if a lamp was extinguished, what harm was there in giving him a posthumous title? Wouldn’t it just demonstrate the magnanimity of us officials from proper scholarly backgrounds?

The officials of the Wei Clique stepped forward one after another, echoing Zhang Xingying’s words.

Emperor Yuanjing said nothing, only glancing at the Right Censor-in-Chief, Yuan Xiong. The latter understood immediately, stepped forward, and declared loudly:

“Utter nonsense! Zhang Xingying and the rest are talking nonsense. Your Majesty, you must not be swayed by these treacherous ministers.”

A slight commotion rippled through the hall, the officials leaning back in a show of caution, each wondering what trick this man was about to pull this time.

Emperor Yuanjing was displeased and frowned.

“Why do you say this, Lord Yuan? Wei Yuan was the military god of our Great Feng, he rendered great service to the realm and gave his life for the country. In life, he was also one of Our most trusted. Conferring a title posthumously is only right.”

“Your Majesty!”

Yuan Xiong shouted, “That man Wei Yuan deserved to die! He was a reckless brute who brought calamity upon the state and the people, not a meritorious subject!”

“Shameless brute!”

The Left Censor-in-Chief Liu Hong was furious.

He had been personally promoted by Wei Yuan and, like the Minister of War, was a core member of the Wei Clique. Zhang Xingying was one of his subordinates.

_Crack!_

Liu Hong’s angry rebuke was answered by a sharp crack of the whip from the old eunuch, who scolded, “No clamour in the hall.”

With someone backing him, Yuan Xiong showed no fear. He ignored the various cold, hostile, or mocking stares of the officials and proclaimed impassionedly:

“That’s right, Wei Yuan may have captured the headquarters of the Church of the Warlock God, setting a historical precedent, but on that point alone, his crimes are beyond counting.”

Zhang Xingying narrowed his eyes and sneered.

“Capturing the headquarters of the Church of the Warlock God is a crime? Your Majesty, Yuan Xiong colluded with the Church, committing treason by allying with the enemy. Your servant ask that this wretch be beheaded.”

Yuan Xiong remained unfazed and snorted.

“The army set out to aid the Yao and barbarians, to thwart the ambitions of the Church to annex the northern frontier. But look at what Wei Yuan did, he led the army straight to Mount Jing City, the Church’s stronghold, leading to over 80,000 of our Great Feng soldiers perishing far from home.

“Clearly, Wei Yuan was driven by selfish ambition and greed for merit, charging ahead recklessly, and it was this that brought about such a huge loss. Your Majesty, over eighty thousand soldiers, each with parents to support and children to raise.

“Just because Wei Yuan sought glory, he led our soldiers to their deaths on foreign soil. How can such a man, who brought disaster to the nation, be ennobled or given a posthumous title of Zhongwu?”

Qian Qingshu of the Wang Clique stepped forward to rebut him.

“Yuan Xiong, cease your deceitful babbling. If we were to aid the Yao and barbarians and compel the Church to retreat, what better way than to strike directly at their headquarters? After Wei Yuan captured it, Jing immediately withdrew their troops. Is that not the clearest proof?

“Moreover, in war, death and injury are inevitable. Capturing the Church’s stronghold was an unprecedented victory. Who are you to slander him?”

Yuan Xiong gave a cold sneer. “Slander? There were countless ways to compel Jing to retreat. Was capturing Yan any harder than taking Mount Jing City? Was seizing Jing’s capital harder?

“Wei Yuan is a master of warfare, he would have known all of this. But he deliberately chose Mount Jing City, resulting in near total annihilation of our army. Only about ten thousand survived.

“Why? Because Wei Yuan wanted to make history. He wanted to leave his name in the annals.”

The officials in the hall murmured again, whispering among themselves.

Did Yuan Xiong have a point?

He did.

This campaign was to contain Jing and force them to withdraw. Wei Yuan could have crippled Yan, besieged their cities, and then crushed the reinforcements from Kang. Would Jing not have retreated then?

Wei Yuan had already reached the capital of Yan, he could have besieged it and struck the incoming reinforcements.

Or perhaps, a surprise assault on Jing’s capital would have been even better.

Yet he chose instead to attack Mount Jing City and perished with the Church of the Warlock God. It was indeed a historic first, but it also meant the destruction of his forces.

The 18,000 surviving troops mostly retreated from Yan. Fewer than five thousand survived the battle at Mount Jing City.

None of the officials truly believed Wei Yuan hadn’t pursued glory recklessly.

Sensing the moment was ripe, Minister of War Qin Yuandao stepped forward and said gravely:

“Your Majesty, I believe Censor Yuan speaks the truth. Wei Yuan’s pursuit of merit led not only to the loss of over 80,000 troops, but also provoked retaliation from the Church. If not for Xu Qi’an’s timely presence at Yuyang Pass in Xiangzhou, that place would have become a wasteland, its people massacred, history repeating the tragedy from forty years ago.”

The faces of the Wei Clique officials shifted slightly.

Qin Yuandao was using that incident to strike at Duke Wei, and it was true, leaving them no room to refute it.

Had Yuyang Pass fallen and Xiangzhou suffered slaughter in revenge, then Duke Wei’s actions would have no merit at all.

Prime Minister Wang furrowed his brows, a strange feeling rising in his heart. The recent attack by the Yan-Kang allied forces on Yuyang Pass almost seemed like a carefully laid plan to erase Wei Yuan’s legacy.

*All this just for a posthumous title? Unlikely. There must be more to it. Perhaps destroying Wei Yuan’s achievements was only one of the aims…* Prime Minister Wang’s heart sank. He stepped forward and said:

“To be quite honest, I’ve seen to Xu Qi’an. He told me he went to Yuyang Pass because Wei Yuan entrusted him with the task. Wei Yuan had anticipated the Church’s retaliation, and thus made arrangements in advance.”

*Brilliant!*

Zhang Xingying and the others lit up.

Qin Yuandao had used Xu Qi’an’s deeds to discredit Duke Wei, but the Prime Minister’s move was like pulling the rug from beneath him.

It couldn’t be verified, as true or not, Xu Qi’an would certainly side with Duke Wei.

Older ginger was indeed spicier.

Yuan Xiong retorted:

“If he foresaw the Church’s retaliation, why didn’t he inform the court? Why entrust the task to a mere civilian? Does the Prime Minister take His Majesty for a toddler to be so easily fooled?”

Yuan Xiong’s and Qin Yuandao’s supporters echoed his words, backing the Right Censor-in-Chief.

The three factions began arguing fiercely.

Just then, a prince of the imperial clan stepped forward and choked with emotion:

“Your Majesty, Wei Yuan’s greed for merit led to Great Feng’s terrible losses, far worse than those suffered by the Yao and barbarians. Was this aiding them? No, it was weakening our own strength. Mount Jing City may have fallen, but where is our victory?

“The Yao and barbarians must be laughing with joy, reaping all the benefits. If they invade Chuzhou again next year, what then?”

His point was simple, Mount Jing City might have been taken, but the Great Feng had lost strategically.

Wei Yuan deserved death!

Several more titled nobles and royal kin stepped forward, supporting Minister Qin Yuandao and Right Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong.

“Enough!”

Emperor Yuanjing’s face showed grief as he said solemnly:

“Duke Wei was one of Our most trusted. He stood by Us for over twenty years and gave his life for the country. We grieve deeply. This matter shall be discussed again tomorrow.”

He immediately rose and strode away.

As he turned his back on the officials, the corners of Emperor Yuanjing’s mouth slowly curled up.

He was smiling.
