# 282. Li Yuchun’s Lifelong Enemy

The sun was high, and the banquet was in full swing. After making a round of toasts, Xu Qi'an excused himself under the pretext of going to the toilet and returned to his study, pondering how to handle the emissary from the Western Region’s Buddhist sect.

Zhong Li sat at the square table, head bowed, taking small bites of her meal.

Based on the research he had done recently, Xu Qi'an believed that the emissaries from the Buddhist sect had two main objectives in visiting the capital.

The primary goal, of course, was to investigate the Sangpo case—this was the main reason for their visit.

*The question is, whether the baldies are just here to gather information, or if they intend to stay in the capital and actively search for clues on Shenshu... I suppose they'll only make that decision after they get a clearer picture of the situation,* Xu Qi'an mused, twirling his brush.

Their secondary objective might be to come and demand answers.

The relationship between the Buddhist sect and the Great Feng was complicated. They’re allies in name but harbour animosity underneath.

Take, for example, the Battle of Shanhai Pass. The Buddhist Kingdoms of the West and the Great Feng were allies, part of the victorious coalition. Meanwhile, the Southern Marches and the Northern tribes were among the defeated.

However, after experiencing that dream of life after death, Xu Qi'an realized that the Battle of Shanhai Pass was far more complex than the historical records made it seem, especially since the Church of the Warlock God of the northeast was also involved.

*The barbarian tribes of the Southern Marches, the northern barbarians, the Northern Yao Tribe, and the Church of the Warlock God in the northeast... If the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom were involved too, then the defeated side had a truly massive coalition*.

*In other words, how powerful was the Great Feng back then? How strong was the Buddhist sect? And just how skilled was Wei Yuan at commanding armies? The more I think about it, the more terrifying it seems.*

But this alliance wasn't solid. Over the past twenty years, the Northern tribes and the Southern Marches had repeatedly invaded the Great Feng's borders, and despite the court’s pleas for help, the Buddhist sect turned a blind eye.

Setting the northern barbarians aside for now, nowadays half of the territory in the Southern Marches had fallen into the hands of the Buddhist sect—the former lands of the Wanyao.

If the Buddhist Kingdoms truly cared about their alliance, they would have directly gone for the enemy crystal. Would the barbarians from the Southern Marches still dare to attack the border?

Of course, the Great Feng wasn’t blameless either. Years ago, Cloud Deer Academy spearheaded the campaign to exterminate the Buddhist sect. More recently, when Shenshu broke free, Jianzheng, that cunning old man, pretended to be ill.

*But their grievance has nothing to do with me. I’m just a humble Silver Gong; it’s up to the court officials and Emperor Yuanjing to worry about this. I wonder if the Jianzheng will intervene... That sly old man probably won't.*

*As the officer in charge of the Sangpo case, I will most likely have to interact with the Buddhists... To be safe, I should go see the Jianzheng.*

*Also, this visit from the emissaries is both a crisis and an opportunity. The Buddhist sect know Shenshu the best. I can use this chance to indirectly probe for more information, which will help me give Shenshu a proper explanation.*

A bold plan began to take shape in Xu Qi'an's mind.

"Zhong Li, let’s go."

Immediately, he donned his Nightwatcher uniform, put on his mink hat, and left the Xu manor.

Riding his ever-reliable little mare, who never got stuck in traffic, he quickly arrived at the Stargazing Tower. He tied up the mare by the steps and climbed the tower alongside Zhong Li.

Just as he finished climbing the stone steps and entered the first-floor hall, a figure in white appeared before him, reciting in a resounding voice:

"Picking the stars with the moon in hand..."

"…there are none like me upon this land." Xu Qi'an interrupted.

... Yang Qianhuan paused for a moment, then resumed his line, his tone leisurely: "Picking the stars with the moon in hand..."

"there are none like me upon this land," Xu Qi'an interrupted again, adding, "Senior Brother Yang, we need to see the Jianzheng. Please don't block our way."

Yang Qianhuan fell silent for a long while before saying, "I’m here for that reason. Teacher sent me to inform you."

Jianzheng already knew I was coming? Xu Qi'an nodded and said, "Please say."

Yang Qianhuan gathered his energy and bellowed, "Piss off!"

…

Xu Qi'an rubbed his ears as he untied the reins of his little mare, muttering, "Does the Sitianjian practice the Buddhist Lion's Roar too? What if I get tinnitus? Will I go deaf?"

As he finished speaking, he saw Zhong Li silently making hand gestures: _I’m deaf. I need to go back and take my medicine, or my ears will stop working._

"..."

Xu Qi'an pointed at his ears, then at himself, as if asking: _Did I cause this?_

Zhong Li shook her head (a weary shake, not wanting to argue with Xu Qi'an).

Xu Qi'an nodded in understanding. It seemed this was yet another of Zhong Li’s misfortunes, and he was merely caught up in her bad luck.

*Jianzheng didn’t want to meet me, which suggests the cover he put on the heavens is strong enough to deal with the Buddhist monks...* Having gotten the answer he sought, Xu Qi'an breathed a sigh of relief.

After waiting for a moment downstairs, Zhong Li returned, having taken her medicine.

"Are your ears better?"

Zhong Li nodded. "Mhm."

The two then headed straight for the Nightwatcher Constabulary and went directly to Min Shan’s Gold Jade Hall. A burly Silver Gong with a scar across his cheek, Min Shan, looked at them with irritation and said, "Your One Blade Hall has already been repaired. Why are you here again?"

The One Blade Hall was Xu Qi'an's "office," a name he had chosen himself, symbolizing that "no hero in the world can withstand one blade of mine."

"Anything happening in the capital today?" Xu Qi'an asked casually.

"You've heard?"

Min Shan snorted. “The Western Region’s emissaries have arrived. They say there's a high monk among them, and for ten miles around, the sky was filled with Buddhist light. Many of the guards on duty at the city gates witnessed it.

"After they entered the city, the commoners went mad, shouting praises of the holy monk. When it comes to manipulating people’s hearts, the Buddhist sect has no equal."

*This must be the ability of a seventh-grade Dharmacarya. I remember reading in the records that a seventh-grade Dharmacarya master can preach and make ordinary people achieve sudden enlightenment, leading them to renounce the world and “pass through the empty door”[^1]...* Xu Qi'an feigned confusion:

"What are the Buddhist emissaries doing in the capital?"

"Who knows?"

Min Shan was unaware of the deeper connection between the Sangpo case and Shenshu, nor did he understand the underlying stakes.

...

A canal boat slowly docked at the docks. On the deck of a three-masted ship stood dozens of Nightwatchers.

Gold Gong Yang Yan and Jiang Lyuzhong led the group off the official ship. As they gazed at the long-lost capital, their hearts swelled with excitement.

Especially for Jiang Lyuzhong and the vanguard led by Governor Zhang—they had been away from the capital for over two months. They had left in the dead of winter, and now, upon their return, willow branches were budding, and new life was sprouting everywhere.

Li Yuchun waved to Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao, saying gravely, "After we report to our superiors, let’s visit Ningyan's grave."

Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao nodded, their expressions somber.

It had been over a month since Xu Ningyan's death. The tidal wave of grief they felt at the time had now settled into their hearts, leaving them with the memory of a fallen colleague or subordinate, someone they would always remember.

Years later, when they looked back on that young, brash man, they would still feel a faint sadness and regret.

Yang Yan, walking ahead, turned back with a blank expression, though his voice was low and solemn: "I will go too."

Governor Zhang sighed. "I must go see His Majesty, so I won't be joining you. Tomorrow, I will personally visit with my wife and children."

His duties would likely keep him busy tomorrow, so he wouldn’t have time to visit Xu Ningyan’s grave.

This group had been away since their time in Qingzhou, drifting on the water. They hadn’t received any letters from the court, and thus were unaware that Xu Qi'an had already come back to life.

Not only had Xu Qi'an revived, but he had also casually solved a palace murder case.

Soon, they arrived at the Nightwatcher Constabulary.

…

On the way out of the Gold and Jade Hall, Xu Qi’an was preparing to visit his own office when Zhong Li suddenly noticed that he had stopped in his tracks. She glanced at Xu Qi’an before following his gaze to the gate of the Constabulary, where a group of dust-covered Nightwatchers were crossing the threshold... and froze on the spot, as if turned to stone statues.

*Who is that man, and why does he look so much like Xu Ningyan…*

*Do we even have a Bronze Gong like this in our Constabulary…*

*Must be seeing things. I swear I just saw Xu Ningyan. But wait, Xu Ningyan wasn't this handsome…*

*Are they brothers? But Xu Ningyan didn’t have any siblings…*

One question after another appeared in the minds of the returning Nightwatchers.

There’s nothing worse than an awkward silence or the sudden resurfacing of painful memories. Xu Qi’an felt that the lyrics from a certain song perfectly fit the mood right now.

With an awkward yet polite smile, he said, "Hello everyone, my name is Xu Qian."

There was bound to be a reunion eventually, but in Xu Qi’an’s mind, the ideal scenario would have been:

Yang Yan and the others would return to the capital and learn from their colleagues in the Constabulary that he had miraculously come back to life. Overwhelmed with joy, they would race over like unleashed wild dogs and hug him while weeping uncontrollably.

This awkward reunion, however, was something he hadn’t anticipated.

*It must be Zhong Li’s bad luck rubbing off on me.*

Li Yuchun stared hard at Xu Qi’an, summoning all his strength before tremblingly asking, "Y-you’re Xu Ningyan?"

The others said nothing, merely watching him silently while holding their breath.

"It’s me. I didn’t die," Xu Qi’an said with a smile.

Upon hearing his confirmation, silence stretched for ten full seconds before Song Tingfeng suddenly let out a loud yell and rushed forward, throwing himself into Xu Qi’an’s arms and hugging him tightly.

"How are you not dead? You were definitely stone-cold dead."

"And what’s with the change in appearance? How did you come back to life? Tell us everything."

"He’s alive, really alive… warm and breathing."

The Nightwatchers surrounded Xu Qi’an, bombarding him with questions, their faces full of excitement.

"I’ll explain later, later…" Xu Qi’an pushed them back gently and with a grin pointed at the Silver Gong insignia on his chest, addressing Li Yuchun, "Boss, I’m a Silver Gong now."

Li Yuchun clasped his hands behind his back, maintaining a composed demeanor as he nodded approvingly, "Not bad, all that effort I put into training you wasn’t wasted."

Xu Qi’an waved to Zhong Li, calling her over, "Zhong Li, come here. Let me introduce you to my boss."

Only now did Li Yuchun notice Zhong Li… Her hair was dry and messy, her coarse robe covered in wrinkles, and her embroidered shoes clearly hadn’t been cleaned in ages. He couldn’t even see her face. Li Yuchun felt as though a cold serpent was slithering up his spine, and his scalp tingled inch by inch.

His face twisted in horror, and he retreated a few steps, shouting, "Whose girl is this? Whose girl is this!!!"

Xu Qi’an hurriedly sent her off, "Zhong Li, head over to my One Blade Hall. Just take a right ahead."

"Okay," Zhong Li muttered, head hanging low as she walked away, looking quite aggrieved.

Li Yuchun let out a long breath of relief, the goosebumps on his arms slowly dissipating.

Afterward, Xu Qi’an gave a detailed explanation of how he had come back to life.

"The Pill of Rebirth? The one that allows someone to shed their old body and gain a new one? I heard even His Majesty once requested one from Jianzheng, but Jianzheng wouldn’t give it to him… Wait, is Chu Caiwei your lover?" Jiang Lyuzhong exclaimed in amazement.

The Nightwatchers who hadn’t known about the Pill of Rebirth were now enlightened after his explanation.

Once the excitement of his colleagues began to settle, Xu Qi’an wrapped an arm around Song Tingfeng’s shoulder, "Let’s hit the Jiaofangsi for some fun tonight."

To his surprise, Song Tingfeng shook his head, "I won’t be going to Jiaofangsi anymore."

He gave Xu Qi’an a stern look, declaring, “I’m not who I used to be. The Song Tingfeng of today is a man of ambition and diligence, focused on his cultivation.

"Ningyan, you’ve changed, and so have I. You can’t look at me with the same eyes as before."

Xu Qi’an scrutinized him in disbelief. It seemed that in the month since his "death," Song Tingfeng had indeed become much more composed and resolute.

Li Yuchun nodded approvingly, "Tingfeng is right. Out of all of us, his growth has been the most significant during this mission to Yunzhou. I’m quite pleased."

Song Tingfeng smiled quietly, full of pride.

Xu Qi’an clapped his hands together and looked around at everyone, "Well, after you all report in, let’s gather tonight at Jiaofangsi for drinks. My treat."

Then, he grabbed Zhu Guangxiao by the shoulder, saying, "I still owe you five visits to Jiaofangsi. We even signed a contract."

The rest of his colleagues were thrilled at this.

Song Tingfeng swallowed hard, "Ningyan, my contract’s part of it too… Tonight, I’ll come to Jiaofangsi."

"You can’t go."

Xu Qi’an’s face turned serious, and he said righteously, "You’re not the same Song Tingfeng anymore. Indulging in debauchery and living recklessly are things Guangxiao and I will handle. You, on the other hand, are a man of ambition and focus now."

...

The Buddhist emissary team stayed at Sanyang station, the largest courier station in the outer city. It was a two-courtyard complex with three ancient willows in the courtyard, from which the station got its name.

A station clerk stepped out from the main gate, glanced around, and quietly slipped into a nearby alley.

In the alley stood a young Nightwatcher, one hand resting on the hilt of his sword, the other fiddling with a piece of silver as he leaned against the wall, waiting.

"Sir, here’s the list of emissaries from the Western Regions. The leader is a monk by the name of Du’e."

The clerk handed over a note, his eyes darting to the piece of silver before he spoke again, "Master Du’e has been summoned to the palace and isn’t at the station."

"Good job."

Xu Qi’an flicked the silver piece, which arced through the air and was caught skillfully by the clerk, who beamed with gratitude. "Thank you, sir!"

After sending the clerk away, Xu Qi’an quickly shed his Nightwatcher uniform and retrieved a monk’s robe from his Earth Book Fragment, slipping it on. He touched his freshly shaved head, gritting his teeth as he comforted himself:

*It’ll grow back.*

A few minutes later, a handsome monk with an upright bearing strolled out of the alley, his robe swaying gently.

At the station gate, two young monks were on guard duty instead of station clerks.

"This brother, may we know your name?" the monks stepped forward, blocking his way.

Xu Qi’an pressed his palms together and recited a prayer, "Amitabha. This humble monk is Hengyuan from Qinglong Temple. Upon hearing that fellow disciples have come from the Western Regions, I’ve come to pay my respects."

"Brother Hengyuan from Qinglong Temple…?" The two monks were not easily fooled and scrutinized Xu Qi’an carefully, "But hasn’t Brother Hengyuan broken his vows?"

"This humble monk is a martial monk," Xu Qi’an replied, his tone carrying the air of one sharing a sect secret with fellow insiders.

The two monks immediately understood, their attitude becoming much more respectful. "Please, Brother Hengyuan, come inside!"
