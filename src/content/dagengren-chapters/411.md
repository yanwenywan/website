# 411. The Lotus Ripens

Bang!

Just before the two fists clashed, a look of admiration flashed in Cao Qingyang’s eyes.

The sould of the collision was crisp. Xu Qi’an’s leant back, as though he was about to fall, when suddenly, the muscles around his waist and abdomen rippled like water, exerting force in an unnatural way, pulling him back upright by sheer force.

Cao Qingyang retreated repeatedly, unloading the force while shaking his aching arm.

Around them, the tense atmosphere froze abruptly.

Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen, having avoided the blade aura, paused, neither advancing nor retreating, staring in astonishment at Xu Qi’an.

*Surely not…*

Tianji and Tianshu were both shocked and furious, eyes locked onto Xu Qi’an, watching his every move, every subtle shift in his body.

A nearly inconceivable thought surfaced in their minds.

The Daoists of the Earth Sect squinted, glaring at Xu Qi’an with malice. Daoist Lanlian’s eyes flashed with a vicious gleam as he sneered, “Cao Qingyang, how much longer are you planning to toy around?”

To those from the Daoist sects, it seemed Cao Qingyang was deliberately holding back again.

“Just- just now… that punch…”

The masters of the Wulin Alliance exchanged uncertain glances.

As high-rank martial artists, they were far more knowledgeable than the Earth Sect Daoists.

The impact of that punch, the subtle movements as Alliance Leader Cao rapidly retreated to unload the force, all proved that he wasn’t acting — he was genuinely forced back by Xu Qi’an’s punch.

*Whew…*

Xu Qi’an let out a long breath, suppressing the wild joy in his heart, resisting the urge to let his delight show on his face, and calmly said:

“I’m fifth rank now.”

In truth, the line he really wanted to say was: I’ve become an Earthly Immortal!

Even so, these words still caused a tremendous uproar among the ‘audience’.

*He’s really reached Fifth Rank. He did say he wanted to use this opportunity to advance to Fifth Rank…* Li Miaozhen’s emotions were extremely mixed, feeling both joy for him and her own sense of loss.

She was the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect — what is a Holy Maiden? Only the most gifted and promising among her peers could earn that title.

And the Heaven Sect’s status in the martial world was lofty, almost divine. Every disciple of the Heaven Sect, once they stepped into the world, was hailed as a prodigy.

Li Miaozhen was the prodigy among prodigies.

At just over twenty, she had already reached Rank Four. By the time she blossomed into her prime, how far could her cultivation go?

The Heaven Sect’s Daoist Leader had once said that this generation’s Holy Son and Holy Maiden had a strong chance of advancing to Rank Three, transcending mortal limits.

For twenty years, Li Miaozhen had been proud, until she met Xu Qi’an, suddenly realising that her talent, which she had always been so proud of, seemed merely “not bad” compared to his.

“A rare genius, a prodigy…”

Yang Cuixue’s expression was full of emotion, his tone carrying a sigh, “The number of talented young men I’ve seen is as countless as the carp crossing the river, yet Silver Gong Xu stands out as the finest among them. His talent is truly astonishing.”

“Breaking through in the midst of battle, advancing to Rank Five — Silver Gong Xu is truly remarkable. The rumours that his aptitude rivals that of the Zhenbei King are no exaggeration,” Xiao Yuenu sighed.

Her face was covered with a veil, hiding her expression, but her autumn-like eyes suddenly shone with starlight.

Joining the Nightwatchers at the end of the official evaluation, he was only at the peak of Refining Essence back then. In less than a year, he advanced from a peak ninth-rank fast bailiff to a fifth-rank Transforming Force martial artist…

In Tianji and Tianshu’s minds, Xu Qi’an’s dossier flashed unbidden.

This level of talent even surpassed Chu Yuanzhen.

Chu Yuanzhen had resigned from office to practise martial arts, far past the prime age for starting cultivation. No one believed he could make any real achievements in martial arts.

Yet, he had risen up regardless, slapping everyone in the face.

In just a few years, he openly challenged a Rank Four Gold Gong, causing a great sensation in the capital at the time. Wei Yuan had praised him as the capital’s greatest swordsman.

That was why.

But Xu Qi’an’s talent was even greater than Chu Yuanzhen’s.

If such a man wasn’t killed, he would become a great threat in the future.

Qiu Chanyi’s nose was red, her eyes rimmed with tears, tear tracks still visible on her cheeks. At this moment, her small mouth hung slightly open, overwhelmed with shock.

“Many thanks to Alliance Leader Cao for making this possible.”

Xu Qi’an offered a sincere thanks.

Cao Qingyang nodded, saying, “Your Golden Body has reached its limit. Without this protective divine skill, even if you’ve reached Rank Five Transforming Force, it would still only take me one punch. Concede.”

Physical resilience was the foundation of a martial artist’s close-combat abilities. Without Bronze Skin and Iron Bones, how could one withstand an opponent’s blows?

Xu Qi’an refused, “How will I know if I don’t try?”

Cao Qingyang’s voice deepened, “This time, I won’t hold back.”

As his words echoed, his figure was torn apart by the wind — only an afterimage. The violet-clad leader flashed before Xu Qi’an, sending a straight punch at his face.

Xu Qi’an’s figure dissipated, reappearing to Cao Qingyang’s left.

“Has Alliance Leader Cao forgotten my signature technique?”

Xu Qi’an launched into rapid close-quarters strikes, his fists and palms clanging against Cao Qingyang’s body.

He vanished again, avoiding Cao Qingyang’s counter, reappearing on the opposite side, ready to unleash a new round of rapid attacks.

However, Cao Qingyang’s martial intuition was equally sharp. He reached back to grab Xu Qi’an’s wrist, simultaneously leaning his body like a collapsing stone pillar.

Xu Qi’an withdrew his hand just in time, fists alternating in a relentless barrage, forcing the ‘collapsing pillar’ back into place.

Bang bang bang! Smack smack smack!

With only body techniques, the two created a spectacle that left the spectators dumbfounded. Their relentless, seamless moves were as fierce as they were flawless.

Anyone else of the same rank would have died ten times over in such brutal melee combat.

The audience outside the ring gradually realised — at some point, Xu Qi’an had begun to suppress Alliance Leader Cao.

Silver Gong Xu seemed to possess foresight, always evading or cutting off Cao Qingyang’s attacks in advance, then delivering a ruthless counter.

Although Alliance Leader Cao relied on his near-indestructible body to partially ignore Xu Qi’an’s strikes, the fact remained that he was on the back foot.

*If Silver Gong Xu’s Vajra Divine Art was still intact, with his body at full strength, Alliance Leader Cao might have been completely overwhelmed…* many couldn’t help but think.

At that moment, Xu Qi’an’s face suddenly flushed, his movements stiffening. Such a massive opening couldn’t possibly be ignored. Cao Qingyang seized the chance, landing a punch on Xu Qi’an’s chest, sending him staggering back.

Without pause, the attacks continued — a flying kick followed the punch, then a rapid barrage of short punches, followed by elbow strikes and whipping kicks, before pulling back into yet another fierce sequence.

Bang!

The golden light trembled violently, then completely shattered.

The Vajra Divine Art was broken.

Xu Qi’an struck Cao Qingyang’s chest with his palm, twisted his wrist, and swept his palm upwards along his opponent’s hardened chest, landing a strike on Cao Qingyang’s chin.

Thud, thud, thud... Alliance Leader Cao staggered back a few steps, feeling as though his jaw had nearly been dislocated.

Xu Qi’an ended the bout, cupping his fists in salute, “I’ve lost.”

*It seems Alliance Leader Cao’s skills are indeed superior...* Just as this thought crossed everyone’s minds, they heard Cao Qingyang say:

“You’re injured. If you were in peak condition, I might not be your match.”

*Was Alliance Leader Cao saying that, purely in terms of martial technique, he couldn’t defeat Xu Qi’an?*

One after another, peculiar gazes fixed on Xu Qi’an.

At that moment, from within the cold pond, a nine-coloured lotus burst into resplendent rays, shooting straight into the sky.

A few breaths later, the radiance dissipated, and the nine-coloured lotus bud floating on the pond began to bloom, petal by petal.

One after another, gazes shifted away from Xu Qi’an and onto the lotus. In an instant, countless breaths grew hurried.

From Daoist Lanlian’s brow suddenly erupted a torrential cascade of black mist, condensing into a vaguely human figure, which shot towards the cold pond and the nine-coloured lotus before anyone could react.

The Earth Sect Daoist Leader’s avatar had, all along, been concealed within Daoist Lanlian, fooling everyone.

He intended to snatch the lotus with lightning speed and flee before the mysterious expert who had appeared in Chuzhou could respond.

Indeed, all along, the Earth Sect Daoist Leader believed that powerful figure was lurking nearby.

Cao Qingyang’s palm became a blade, slashing out a blade intent that effortlessly sliced through the black mist, yet the mist quickly reformed, suffering no substantial harm.

By the pond, Daoist Jinlian, seated cross-legged with his eyes closed, finally opened his eyes.

“Heilian, I’ve been waiting for you.”

As he spoke, Daoist Jinlian’s brow collapsed inward like a black hole, birthing a vortex that drew in the Earth Sect Daoist Leader’s avatar.

Daoist Jinlian promptly shut his eyes again, becoming as still as a stone statue.

He would be battling the Earth Sect Daoist Leader’s avatar in another realm.

While Daoist Jinlian had resolved one threat, he had also effectively handed the lotus to the Wulin Alliance.

The Earth Sect Daoists and King Huai’s spies all moved in unison, vying for the lotus seeds.

As for these "lackeys", Alliance Leader Cao merely swept out his blade in retaliation, his blade intent crisscrossing the field.

Splurt...

Everyone present, aside from those of fourth rank, spewed blood under the sweeping blade intent.

Only one person dared to stand in his way.

Cao Qingyang narrowed his eyes, coldly staring at this audacious young man.

“Silver Gong Xu, our wager is over. This time, I won’t hold back. I’ve already given you all the face you deserve. From here on, even if I slap you to death, no one in the martial world could say a word against me.”

Tianji and Tianshu, caught in stunned anger, suddenly found this turn of events perfectly to their liking.

The two had been fretting over how to kill Xu Qi’an, shielded as he was by Yue Clan Manor and several self-proclaimed righteous heroes of the Wulin Alliance.

Suddenly, the situation had reversed entirely.

Cao Qingyang was determined to claim the nine-coloured lotus. He had already conceded and given Xu Qi’an enough face. Now, Xu Qi’an was the one refusing to yield and repeatedly obstructing him. Even if Cao Qingyang injured or killed him now, no one could fault him.

The disciples of the Heaven and Earth Society grew anxious, calling out:

“Master Xu, you’ve done your utmost. There’s no need to keep guarding the lotus seed.”

“Master Xu, please step back, quickly.”

They genuinely believed Xu Qi’an had done more than enough. In their eyes, Silver Gong Xu had already given one hundred thousand per cent. The Heaven and Earth Society disciples even felt that, compared to Xu Qi’an’s safety, the lotus seed no longer mattered.

Xu Qi’an paid them no mind, smiling at Cao Qingyang. “I’m not the one blocking you — there’s someone else.”

He reached into his robes, pinched out a yellow talisman amulet, and ignited it with what little qi remained.

He shouted, “National Teacher, save me! I’m Xu Qi’an.”
