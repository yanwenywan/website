# 379. Prime Minister Sir, a great calamity has struck Chuzhou

*He wasn’t guessing about the Zhenbei King; Duke Wei meant he guessed Emperor Yuanjing...* Xu Qi’an nodded slowly, acknowledging Wei Yuan’s explanation.

*Based on the facts he deduced, even if the Zhenbei King's massacre of the city wasn’t directly authorised by Emperor Yuanjing, it was at least a conspiracy between the two brothers. So perhaps the idea of slaughtering Chuzhou City originated from Emperor Yuanjing himself.*

*Would Emperor Yuanjing go to such lengths solely to aid the Zhenbei King in ascending to Rank Two? Even if he trusted the Zhenbei King implicitly and hoped for his promotion, at most he would tacitly permit the Zhenbei King’s actions. That would align more with Emperor Yuanjing’s cunning and depth, befitting his imperial statecraft...* Xu Qi’an furrowed his brow and asked:

"Un.. understood. Then, does His Majesty have other motives?"

Wei Yuan fell silent for a moment before replying, "Next question."

For an instant, Xu Qi’an thought he saw a flicker of hesitation in Wei Yuan's expression, though he couldn't be sure.

*Does Emperor Yuanjing indeed have other motives? And Duke Wei knows them but is unwilling to share…* Xu Qi’an, ever skilled at reading micro-expressions and psychology, hid his reaction and asked instead:

"Was the information given to me by the spy Cai’er in Sanhuang County false?"

He had returned to find Cai’er, only to learn from the brothel’s madam that a man had redeemed her freedom the very next day after his departure.

"It was just an excuse to send you away. Chuzhou City was far too dangerous; you would’ve been a lamb to the slaughter." Wei Yuan held his teacup, blowing on it lightly but still not drinking, and said, "Is your next question whether I leaked the Chuzhou information to the barbarians?"

Xu Qi’an nodded.

Wei Yuan smirked faintly. "His Majesty had already secretly retrieved the Sovereign Sword from the Yongzhen Shanhe Temple and rushed it to Chuzhou. The two brothers’ plan was not merely to massacre the city to refine a pill. If the location were leaked, they intended to eliminate Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu in one fell swoop.

"And they would also shift the blame for the massacre onto the barbarians and Yao clans. After all, the people of the Great Feng are already accustomed to hearing tales of barbarian raiders pillaging borderlands, stealing grain, and abducting people—rumours that have persisted for centuries.

"The Zhenbei King slaughtered Chuzhou City's people to gather enough life force and then intended to use the Princess Consort’s spiritual essence to ascend. Since that was his goal, he could let the dogs devour each other.

"As long as one of Jili Zhigu or Zhujiu falls, the pressure on the northern border will ease, and the people will enjoy years of peace. If it’s the Zhenbei King who falls, then that will be the ultimate punishment for him. And I’ll take the opportunity to seize control of the northern armies, laying the groundwork for an autumn campaign against the Church of the Warlock God."

*So it was all about letting the dogs fight amongst themselves. Whoever died, it would be a cause for celebration...* Xu Qi’an stared at him and asked quietly, "But if not for that mysterious expert’s intervention, the outcome of this affair would have been the Zhenbei King ascending to Rank Two and becoming a Great Feng hero. Could you accept such an outcome, Duke Wei?"

"The Zhenbei King wouldn’t have ascended to Rank Two because you intercepted the Princess Consort in advance." Wei Yuan blew gently at his tea again without drinking.

"You... you already knew?"

Xu Qi’an’s face froze, and he forced an awkward smile. "How did you know?"

Wei Yuan set down his teacup with a faintly exasperated expression. "I used my brain. We’ll discuss this matter later."

After a pause, he continued the previous topic: "If the Zhenbei King emerged as the victor and consumed the blood pill to reach the pinnacle of Rank Three, that would’ve been perfect. When waging war against the Church of the Warlock God, he would have been the one sent to the front lines.

"Heh, when the Church of the Warlock God mounts a major invasion, the court will desperately need high-ranking martial artists to lead the army. And with the northern experts already dead, the Zhenbei King would have no excuse to remain aloof.

"Whatever happens in the north, far from the capital, is beyond control. But in the army, on the battlefield, punishing the Zhenbei King would be simple. The Church of the Warlock God, as a fierce tiger, is far more useful than Jili Zhigu or Zhujiu."

Leaking the information to the Yao and barbarian clans, forcing them into conflict with the Zhenbei King, was both a ploy to let the tiger and wolf devour one another and to use the wolves to wound the tiger. If the Yao and barbarians lost, the enhanced Zhenbei King would deal with the Church of the Warlock God’s invasion—only to face the same scheme again later.

And if the Zhenbei King fell, the guilty would be punished, and Wei Yuan could take control of the army, restoring military authority to himself under the guise of securing the north. For who would best guard the north, should the barbarian threat remain unchecked?

The answer was obvious.

Xu Qi’an swallowed nervously and shook his head. "But the Zhenbei King colluded with the Church of the Warlock God."

Wei Yuan gave a gentle smile. "If interests align, even I could collaborate with the Church of the Warlock God. But when those interests clash, even the closest allies will turn on each other. Therefore, the Zhenbei King didn’t need to die in Chuzhou."

"Xu Qi’an, remember this: a good strategist must endure. Reckless courage may bring brief satisfaction but will cost you dearly."

*But Duke Wei, I am a martial artist at heart. I neither revere gods nor worship the Buddha. I bow neither to kings nor heaven. When angered, I dare to overturn the heavens. That’s the essence of a true martial artist.*

*You taught me this yourself...*

Wei Yuan, a master strategist, preferred to hide in the shadows, pulling strings and progressing step by step. He often focused on outcomes, tolerating losses and sacrifices along the way.

Xu Qi’an knew he wasn’t capable of such detachment. He followed his heart, valuing the process more than the results.

For instance, when the Silver Gong surnamed Zhu defiled a thirteen-year-old girl, Xu Qi’an could have endured. By now, he would have had the power to ruin the Zhu family completely.

But back then, Xu Qi’an chose to cripple Zhu with a single slash, leading to his own sentence of chopping at the waist.

This was the difference Wei Yuan had pointed out—endurance versus impulsive bravery.

However, the cost of endurance was the suffering of that innocent girl at the hands of a beast, her humiliation witnessed by many men. The end result? A rope from the rafters or a plunge into a well.

What meaning would revenge have afterward?

The girl would still be dead.

What Xu Qi’an wanted at the time wasn’t revenge after the fact but to ensure the girl’s safety and well-being in the moment.

One slash, a clear conscience, and no regrets.

*Ultimately, Duke Wei and I are different…* Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly and asked, “Duke Wei, how did you know the princess consort wouldn’t meet Zhenbei King?”

A surge of doubt arose in his mind, making him suspect that the one who betrayed the princess consort was none other than Wei Yuan.

Wei Yuan spoke slowly, “The servant girls Yang Yan had the Imperial Guards send back—I've already sent them to King Huai’s manor. With Yang Yan’s personality, if those servant girls were clean, he would have sent them back directly. Sending them to me instead means there was an issue.

“After questioning them, I realised the princess consort must have been rescued by you. Yang Yan probably suspects the same, which is why he sent them to the Nightwatcher Constabulary first. Other than him, no one has seen the scene, so your ‘suspicion’ is minimal. Most people wouldn’t link it to you.

“However, with our emperor’s suspicious nature, even the slightest possibility wouldn’t be ignored. He may send people to investigate. That said, right now, he neither has the time nor the energy to focus on the princess consort.”

*No wonder, before leaving Chuzhou, Yang Yan told me to consult Duke Wei more often…* Xu Qi’an heaved a sigh of relief. *Having reliable teammates is truly a blessing.*

At this moment, Wei Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly, his expression turning serious. “Before the delegation set out, the emperor specifically warned me about the princess consort accompanying the group. It was a veiled message: ‘don’t make any moves.’ Yet, her whereabouts were still leaked.”

Xu Qi’an’s heart stirred. “Duke Wei, regarding this, I must report something in detail.”

Wei Yuan’s deep and weathered eyes gleamed faintly, and his posture straightened a bit. “Let’s hear it.”

“There’s an arcanist faction secretly supporting the barbarian tribes. The day I fought… fought my way in, I found an arcanist mingling among the barbarian experts.”

Wei Yuan pondered. “The one who orchestrated the silver tax case?”

… Xu Qi’an choked slightly, sighing inwardly. With Wei Yuan’s wisdom, how could he overlook the mysterious arcanist from the silver tax case?

“Former Assistant Minister of Revenue Zhou Xianping is most likely connected to this mysterious arcanist. I consulted the Jianzheng about this, but the old man didn’t give me a clear answer. What’s certain is that this mysterious figure has other agents within the court.”

Wei Yuan merely mentioned this in passing, and the two of them naturally shifted the conversation without delving deeper. The transition was seamless, so natural that neither realised something was amiss.

“How do you plan to settle Mu Nanzhi?” Wei Yuan asked with a faintly amused tone.

“What does Duke Wei suggest?” Xu Qi’an humbly sought advice.

Wei Yuan pondered for a moment. “Keep her as an external consort, but control yourself. Before reaching Rank Three, don’t touch her. Otherwise, it’s a waste of her potential.”

*Ah, Duke Wei, how crude of you. Hehehe.*

“Anything else?” Wei Yuan looked at him warmly.

“What’s so special about the princess consort? What is her true identity?”

This question had been buried in his heart for a long time.

“Go to Cloud Deer Academy and find a book called _The Collected Records of the Great Zhou_. You’ll understand after reading it,” Wei Yuan replied, then asked, “Any other questions?”

Xu Qi’an shook his head.

Wei Yuan nodded slightly and looked at him. “After bringing the Zhenbei King’s remains back to the capital, what’s your plan?”

Hearing this, Xu Qi’an’s expression turned solemn, and he answered resolutely, “To convict Zhenbei King and seek justice for the people of Chuzhou.”

Having been a policeman, he valued the proper closure and public judgment of crimes.

The Zhenbei King had committed an unspeakable atrocity by massacring the city. Even in death, he didn’t deserve a decent reputation in history.

Wei Yuan glanced at him. “Court politics aren’t your forte. Leave this matter alone.”

Xu Qi’an froze. “What do you mean, Duke Wei?”

Wei Yuan didn’t answer, finally taking a sip of his lukewarm tea.

“……”

Xu Qi’an rose, cupped his fists in salute, and left the Tower of Noble Spirit.

…

At the Ministry of Law.

Head Constable Chen hadn’t even had a chance to return home. After leaving the palace, he hurried straight to the ministry.

Familiar with the place, he entered the office and saw Minister Sun at his desk, immersed in paperwork. Constable Chen respectfully said, “Minister, I’ve returned to the capital.”

Minister Sun looked up, startled. “When did you return?”

Constable Chen crossed the threshold, entering the office, and replied softly, “Just now. I came directly to report to you.”

*It seems the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles case hasn’t been resolved…* Minister Sun surmised. Lowering his gaze back to the documents, he said indifferently, “What’s the progress of the investigation?”

This wasn’t mere speculation but a judgment based on extensive experience in officialdom.

For a case as significant as Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles, if resolved, the delegation would’ve sent a report ahead of time, prompting the emperor to hold a small court assembly in the royal study. However, he had received no news, suggesting the case ended inconclusively and thus lost attention.

Constable Chen looked at the minister handling paperwork and said softly, “Chuzhou City… is gone.”

Minister Sun hummed absent-mindedly. After a few seconds, he slowly looked up, as if the words had just registered, staring at Constable Chen and enunciating each word:

“What—did—you—say?”

Constable Chen took a deep breath and clarified, “The Zhenbei King massacred it.”

Minister Sun froze in place.

The atmosphere in the office instantly became heavy and silent. In the oppressive quiet, Minister Sun pushed himself up from his desk, his expression dazed as he stared at Constable Chen:

“The Zhenbei King… Where is he?”

Constable Chen replied solemnly, “The Zhenbei King has been executed.”

A wave of dizziness struck. Minister Sun’s vision blackened momentarily as he slumped back into his chair.

Constable Chen hurried forward. “Minister, are you all right?”

Minister Sun waved him off, his hand trembling slightly. “Explain everything, in full detail.”

Constable Chen immediately recounted everything he’d witnessed and experienced, leaving nothing out.

Reporting the details to their respective superiors and rallying the civil officials to pressure Emperor Yuanjing was the delegation’s pre-arranged strategy.

Half an hour later, during the midday meal, Minister Sun’s carriage left the Ministry of Law in a hurry, heading straight for the royal palace.

Around the same time, the High Court Minister’s carriage also departed his office, making its way to the same destination.

…

The Imperial City, Wang Manor.

The Wang family’s estate was a gift from Emperor Yuanjing, located within the Imperial City, heavily guarded, and one of the privileges of the Prime Minister.

At this moment, it was lunchtime. Wang Zhenwen had returned from the cabinet to dine at home, a journey of no more than a quarter of an hour.

At the dining table, Wang Zhenwen's gaze swept across his wife, his two sons, and his daughter-in-law, but his daughter, Wang Simu, was conspicuously absent. He frowned and asked, “Where is Mu’er?”

“She went out early in the morning, claiming she had plans to go hiking with someone,” responded the dignified and composed Lady Wang.

“Hiking?”

The Prime Minister’s brows furrowed deeper. He looked at his wife and, as though seeking confirmation, asked, “Mu’er has been going out frequently these past days, meeting with people often, hasn’t she?”

The Prime Minister was burdened with countless state affairs, remembering such details demonstrated his attentiveness to his daughter.

Lady Wang hesitated for a moment, while the others kept their heads down, focusing on their food.

Only the second son of the Wang family, whose mind was comparatively simpler, took a sip of wine and grinned. “Father, our sister has been seeing the second son of the Xu family recently—Xu Xinnian, the huiyuan in the spring examinations. Didn’t you know?”

The atmosphere at the table instantly froze. One expressionless face after another turned towards the second son of the Wang family, silently staring at him with a gaze that seemed to say: *Are you an idiot?*

The second son frowned slightly. Simu was of the age to marry, and her match was a scholar of the Hanlin Academy, a position of the utmost prestige.

*For their sister to fancy Xu Xinnian willingly, this was what people called a match made in heaven. Well… something in that vein.*

*Once their relationship deepened, Father could have Xu Xinnian formally propose, and Simu could be married off smoothly. A blissful union would then be realised.*

When he himself had married his wife, he had done something similar. Initially, his wife’s family had been reluctant, disapproving of his lack of an official position. The second son of the Wang family, accompanied by attendants and guards, spent an entire day reasoning with his wife’s family, and only then did he bring her back as his bride.

Now, his little wife couldn’t be happier, much more so than she had been at her maiden home.

Wang Zhenwen’s expression grew increasingly grave, though his tone remained unchanged—if anything, it became even calmer, colder. “Xu Qi’an’s cousin?”

Lady Wang cautiously observed her husband’s expression and nodded slightly, offering an explanation: “It’s not as exaggerated second son says. At most, they have a mutual fondness for each other.”

Wang Zhenwen nodded, his emotions unreadable.

After lunch, during the two hours allocated for rest, Wang Zhenwen was preparing to return to his room for a nap when the steward rushed in, standing at the entrance to the main hall. “Master, Minister Sun from the Ministry of Law has come to visit.”

At this hour... Wang Zhenwen was somewhat taken aback. “Invite him to my study.”

What surprised Wang Zhenwen even more was that, following Minister Sun, the Minister of the High Court also arrived. The Minister of the High Court was currently the leader of the Qi Clique.

Additionally, several other officials of significant standing arrived, ranging in rank from fourth to seventh, but all held positions of real power.

In the study, after instructing the servants to serve tea, Wang Zhenwen surveyed the group and, with a faint smile, said, “What’s the occasion today? Have you all brought the wrong invitations and mistaken my residence for a venue hosting a joyous celebration?”

Even when joking, his expression remained stern and imposing.

“Forget about joy; it’s mourning we should be considering,” Minister Sun sighed deeply. “A great calamity has struck Chuzhou, Prime Minister Sir. We need to think carefully about how to handle the situation ahead.”

Wang Zhenwen fixed his gaze on him, then shifted it to the others. Straightening his posture, he asked in a low voice, “What happened?”
