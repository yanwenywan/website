# 389. Asking Souls

The first people to see the self-reproach edict were overwhelmed with shock and disbelief, mixed with the excitement of being the first to witness such a historic moment. The news spread like wildfire.

Soon, countless commoners swarmed to the city gates.

“Is it really a self-reproach edict?”

Illiterate commoners, along with those who couldn’t squeeze their way to the front, shouted anxiously.

“Yes! It’s a self-reproach edict! His Majesty really issued one!” The people in the front row responded loudly.

“Quick, read it out loud!” The crowd behind urged impatiently.

_"His Majesty issues this edict, expressing deep remorse for past misdeeds, stating: With Our meagre virtue, We inherited this great lineage, intending to bring renewal to the realm and restore the ways of Our ancestors. Yet, We trusted the wrong people, leading to the destruction of Chuzhou City…"_

_"…Sixteenth day of the Fifth Month, Yuanjing Year Thirty-Seven."_

The entire self-reproach edict spanned nearly a thousand words. An elderly Confucian scholar standing before the bulletin board recited it aloud, his tone rising and falling with emotion.

Some commoners understood the meaning, but many were still bewildered. However, they grasped one crucial fact—Emperor Yuanjing had indeed issued a self-reproach edict!

“Is this because of the Chuzhou massacre case?”

“His Majesty issued a self-reproach edict, which means that what Silver Gong Xu said yesterday was all true, right?”

“All those slanderous rumours circulating in the streets about Silver Gong Xu were false, weren’t they?”

This was what the common people cared about most. Although they had trusted Xu Qi’an in their hearts, there had also been numerous rumours defaming him the previous day, each sounding plausible.

They desperately needed an official confirmation to put an end to those rumours.

After all, in the minds of the common folk, the court’s authority was deeply ingrained. If the imperial court officially acknowledged the truth and Silver Gong Xu’s credibility remained intact, then no one would believe the slander ever again.

The elderly scholar raised his hands, and the crowd immediately fell silent. He nodded in satisfaction, then sighed and said:

“His Majesty has issued a self-reproach edict, admitting to condoning Zhenbei King’s massacre of Chuzhou. Everything Silver Gong Xu said yesterday was true. Had it not been for his righteous fury and drawn blade, the injustice of the Chuzhou massacre would have never been redressed, and Lord Zheng… would have died with grievances unavenged.”

Cheers and curses erupted simultaneously, shaking the entire area.

“It is a blessing for Great Feng to have a man like Silver Gong Xu.”

“Pity that Silver Gong Xu is no longer an official.”

“What does it matter? He is still the Great Feng’s hero.”

As for the curses…

“An incapable emperor! Are the people of Chuzhou not citizens of Great Feng?!”

“Twenty years of Daoist cultivation makes a foolish ruler! To have allowed the Zhenbei King to commit such atrocities—this is the act of a tyrant!”

“The Great Feng will perish at his hands sooner or later…”

The cursing soon subsided as the surrounding soldiers intervened to suppress the dissenters, yet the people continued to mutter their curses in hushed tones or in the depths of their hearts.

Even so, the soldiers made no real effort to punish these commoners for their crime of great disrespect.

After all, the very act of issuing a self-reproach edict was an admission of guilt—it was meant to give the people an outlet for their anger and grievances.

……

The Imperial Academy.

The Imperial Academy, one of the most sacred places of learning in the realm, usually resounded with the studious voices of scholars reciting their lessons. But today, it was filled with impassioned accusations and furious denunciations.

When scholars cursed, they did so with a flair far beyond that of commoners.

“The Zhenbei King does not deserve mourning, but who would have thought even His Majesty… An incapable ruler! This is an omen of a nation’s downfall! How could he be allowed to act so recklessly? Did the Jianzheng truly not foresee this?”

“Not a single true man among the entire court! We have studied the sages' teachings tirelessly, and yet we must be grouped with these spineless scholars?”

“If not for Silver Gong Xu slaying those two traitors and shaking the court to its core, they would never have dared to stand against His Majesty! Bah! If it were me, I would have smashed my head against the floor on the spot!”

“A martial artist may break the law with brute force, but in the face of such monstrous inhumanity, only a martial artist had the courage to set things right.”

“Sigh… When future generations read about this in the history books, the disgrace of the scholars of our time will be laid bare. What a pity that Silver Gong Xu is not one of our Confucian scholars.”

Just then, a young scholar burst into the academy, his face alight with excitement. “Everyone, I’ve just heard some great news!”

The gathered scholars turned to look at him, frowning.

Even though the emperor had issued a self-reproach edict and acknowledged the truth, ensuring that loyal officials did not die in vain, the event itself remained a dark tragedy. Hardly a matter for celebration.

Yet the young scholar, brimming with excitement, declared, “I just heard that today, Dean Zhao Shou of Cloud Deer Academy appeared in court and, before His Majesty and all the officials, declared—declared that Silver Gong Xu is his personal disciple!”

*What?!*

In an instant, the entire courtyard erupted, the scholars' expressions turning from solemn to elated. They surged forward in excitement.

“Silver Gong Xu is a student of Cloud Deer Academy?”

“He is Dean Zhao’s personal disciple?! Is this true?”

Several scholars’ faces flushed red as they grabbed the young man’s sleeve, demanding confirmation.

_If I say it was a joke, I will probably get beaten up…_ The young scholar swallowed his hesitation and nodded. “This is being discussed among the officials. It is not an unfounded rumour.”

“Hahaha! Today is full of joyous occasions! We must celebrate with drinks—come, let’s go drinking!”

“No studying today. Just this once, let us indulge ourselves!”

For years, the fact that Great Feng’s premier poet was a martial artist had been a thorn in the side of the scholar community. Every time it was brought up, they felt a mix of admiration and frustration.

They believed that future generations, upon reading this chapter of history, would mock the scholars of this era. And what did scholars value most? Their posthumous reputation.

Now that it was confirmed Xu Qi’an was a student of Cloud Deer Academy, their joy was indescribable. Although there was an ideological rivalry between Cloud Deer Academy and the Imperial Academy, the history books would not bother with such distinctions.

A Confucian scholar was still a Confucian scholar.

The scholars of the Imperial Academy called upon their friends and rushed out to celebrate with wine.

The Assistant Minister reported this to the Chief Minister, angrily exclaiming, “Nearly half of the academy’s students have gone off to indulge themselves! And today is not a rest day.”

The elderly Chief Minister, reclining on a soft couch, showed no expression. Instead, he murmured:

“The events of today’s court session have taught us that those who follow the Dao gain support, while those who go against it find themselves alone. The sages do not deceive us.”

His meaning was clear—one must not stand against the will of the people. In the face of an overwhelming tide, one must learn when to abandon rigid rules and make concessions.

The Assistant Minister, having run into a soft rebuff, frowned and fell into contemplation.

…

Huaiqing Manor.

Dressed in pristine white palace attire, her jet-black hair cascading like a waterfall, Huaiqing sat at the table, her gaze resting on Lin’an in her red dress. She smiled faintly. "He has never let down anyone, has he?"

Then she sighed. "After this incident, His Majesty’s reputation and the prestige of the imperial family will plummet into an abyss."

Lin’an, with her oval face and peach-blossom eyes, wore a sweet smile as she declared righteously, "If you do something wrong, you must admit it! I may not be fond of studying, but the Grand Tutor taught us that admitting mistakes and correcting them is a great virtue."

_Sometimes, being a simpleton truly is a form of happiness..._ Huaiqing inwardly scorned her younger sister, though she would never say it aloud.

It wasn’t out of courtesy to Lin’an, but rather because she knew Lin’an would throw a tantrum, then pounce on her and peck her face in irritation.

Huaiqing found that troublesome.

A wise person does not invite trouble.

Seeing that Huaiqing remained silent, Lin’an lifted her snow-white chin. The elaborate hair ornaments atop her head swayed as she spoke in a coquettish tone:

"Some people cry out about righteousness, criticise Father for his mistakes, but the moment they're needed to take action, they immediately go silent."

As she spoke, she shot Huaiqing a haughty glance, her eyes brimming with triumph. She had finally bested Huaiqing for once.

She was referring to her decision to smuggle Li Miaozhen and Hengyuan into the imperial city and shelter them.

Huaiqing simply smiled.

After Xu Qi’an executed the two traitors, Lin’an had shed her gloom, returning to her lively self. Even more so, since she had played a role in aiding the so-called "rebels," she felt a sense of participation, giving her peace of mind.

Otherwise, she would have dwelled on it for a long time. It might not have become a lifelong burden, but it would have cast a shadow over her otherwise simple, carefree heart.

Huaiqing had deliberately "yielded" this merit to Lin’an for this very reason.

That being said, she was not the kind of indulgent elder sister who would tolerate Lin’an’s provocations without retaliation. With a smile of praise, she replied, "Indeed, you have more backbone than your Crown Prince brother."

Lin’an's little face instantly fell.

"I’m going back to my manor," she huffed, standing up in a temper.

Her jewellery jingled as she moved, and a glimpse of pale yellow entered Huaiqing’s sight—it was a jade pendant, smooth and lustrous.

The aloof princess’ gaze flickered slightly. She frowned. "What is that on your waist?"

Lin’an stretched out her delicate hand, letting the jade pendant rest in her palm. "Oh, this? That running dog gave it to me. The quality and craftsmanship are rather poor, but he carved it himself. Look, so many flaws. If it were bought, it wouldn’t look like this."

She lifted her face proudly, tilting her chin at a graceful angle.

Perhaps even she hadn’t noticed the trace of sweetness in her voice.

Huaiqing’s fair face darkened for an instant, as though a storm had briefly passed over it, but she quickly returned to her usual calm. With a detached expression, she said, "Get out of my sight. You’re an eyesore."

"I was leaving anyway, hmph!"

Lin’an, feeling magnanimous, believed Huaiqing had only called her back to get the last word in and reassert her authority.

Annoyed, she turned and sashayed away, her dress billowing as she exited the hall.

After the red dress disappeared from view, Huaiqing furiously pulled a small, delicate seal from her sleeve and hurled it to the ground.

After a long moment, she got up, lifted her skirt, and went to retrieve it. She carefully inspected the seal and found a small chip on one of its corners.

Her elegant brows knitted together immediately—she felt a pang of regret.

……

Stargazing Tower, a hidden chamber.

Xu Qi’an removed the Yin Pouch, unfastening the red string. Two wisps of azure smoke emerged, forming into the spectral figures of the Duke of Cao and Que Yongxiu.

As their souls materialised, the temperature in the room dropped by several degrees.

This Yin Pouch was specially crafted by Li Miaozhen. It didn’t require an inscribed formation to summon the newly deceased spirits—because the formation was already embedded within the pouch itself.

The Daoist sects were skilled in crafting magical tools, though compared to arcanists, it was merely a secondary expertise rather than their primary profession.

Duke Cao and Que Yongxiu had only recently died. Their souls were still dazed, responding mechanically to questions without independent thought.

Xu Qi’an turned to Duke Cao first. "How did you learn about the Chuzhou massacre?"

Duke Cao murmured blankly, "After Que Yongxiu returned to the capital, he secretly met with His Majesty. Not long after, I was summoned by His Majesty and informed of the matter."

"What did he instruct you to do?"

"To fully cooperate with him…" This included playing along in court, spreading rumours, and other such efforts.

_So, Duke Cao only found out after the fact. That makes him significantly less useful._

Xu Qi’an’s interest in this ghost plummeted.

He then turned to Que Yongxiu. "Do you know the full story behind the massacre?"

Que Yongxiu’s vacant expression did not change. "I do."

"Tell me everything about it."

"……"

_Ah, his intelligence is too low. Of course, I can’t ask broad questions like that. I need to break it down piece by piece…_ Xu Qi’an chastised himself inwardly before calmly continuing.

"Do you know about Zhenbei King’s collaboration with the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect and the high-ranking warlocks of the Church of the Warlock God?"

"I do."

"His Majesty knew about this long ago?"

"The massacre was planned by His Majesty and King Huai from the start…"

This did not surprise Xu Qi’an. Wei Yuan’s hints had already led him to suspect that Emperor Yuanjing was one of the masterminds behind everything.

"Why did they choose to massacre the city instead of starting a war?" Xu Qi’an asked.

"The required amount of blood essence was too vast. A war would take too long, and too many variables could arise. It was not a stable option," Que Yongxiu replied.

"What was Emperor Yuanjing’s true goal in orchestrating this?"

Xu Qi’an had always felt that the emperor was far too eager to support Zhenbei King’s rise, even seeming impatient for his advancement. This was not the mentality of a cautious ruler—especially one as paranoid as Yuanjing.

Could mere “martial obsession” really erase the deep-seated suspicions of such a shrewd and calculating emperor?

"King Huai said that once he advanced to Rank Two, he could counterbalance the Jianzheng, giving the imperial family a true pillar of defence. They would no longer need to fear the Jianzheng and Cloud Deer Academy. This was also His Majesty’s wish."

_That’s not enough of a reason. And you actually believed it?_

Que Yongxiu’s next words made Xu Qi’an’s expression shift.

"His Majesty… wanted to refine a Soul Pill."

_A Soul Pill?! His Majesty is the one who wants to refine it? That can’t be right. Didn’t Daoist Jinlian insist that the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect was the one who needed it?_

_So, the two brothers—one wanted a Blood Pill, the other a Soul Pill—and they both harvested the common folk for their needs…_

*Daoist Jinlian had said that the Soul Pill could strengthen the primordial spirit, serve as an alchemical ingredient, be used in the crafting of magical treasures, repair incomplete souls, and nurture spirit-bound artefacts.*

_But if that’s all, would it really be worth the emperor risking the wrath of the entire world by sacrificing an entire city?_

*Of course, the Soul Pill was only one of the gains—the Blood Pill was essential for Zhenbei King’s breakthrough.*

*However, Zhenbei King was the direct beneficiary. By comparison, Yuanjing’s gains seemed insufficient to justify taking such a gamble.*

_When a person’s gains do not outweigh their risks, then there must be deeper layers to the matter…_ Xu Qi’an rubbed his temples.

He did not linger on the thought for too long. Instead, he continued, "Where is the Soul Pill?"
