*Luo Yuheng needs a man blessed with fortune for dual cultivation. She became the National Teacher, yet she had never been willing to dual cultivate with Emperor Yuanjing…*

*Daoist Jinlian most likely knows about my fortune. He had repeatedly sought medicine from Luo Yuheng, explicitly requesting that I be the one to deliver it…*

*Before I set off for Chuzhou, Luo Yuheng entrusted Chu Yuanzhen with a talisman sword for me…*

*While guarding the lotus seed in Jianzhou, Daoist Jinlian forcibly gave me an amulet, telling me to call for Luo Yuheng in times of crisis. And she really came…*

One seemingly reasonable or unreasonable detail after another flashed through Xu Qi’an’s mind.

*If that’s the case, then my head is going to explode!* His expression turned complicated.

“But I heard that the National Teacher never chose to dual cultivate with Yuanjing.”

Xu Qi’an steadied his emotions and spoke in a casual, conversational tone.

The princess consort looked up thoughtfully and shook her head.

“Hmm… I don’t know about that. I often advised her that she might as well yield to Emperor Yuanjing. Choosing the emperor as a Dao companion wouldn’t be much of a disgrace.

“But she seems dissatisfied with Yuanjing, seemingly in every way. No, she’s disdainful of him.”

*Dissatisfied in every way, not just due to insufficient fortune…* Xu Qi’an’s gaze sharpened. He asked, “With the cultivation of someone like the National Teacher, she wouldn’t concern herself with the old customs of women obeying men, would she?”

The princess consort hummed in response. “Luo Yuheng naturally wouldn’t. But what does choosing a Dao companion have to do with such customs? It’s a matter of great caution.”

*This Luo Yuheng is a shark…* Xu Qi’an’s heart sank.

Dual cultivation meant selecting a Dao companion. This showed how seriously Luo Yuheng regarded relationships between men and women. So, after assessing Yuanjing, she truly only borrowed his fortune to suppress her karmic fire; she never intended to dual cultivate with him.

*If my earlier guess was correct, then Luo Yuheng is also assessing me.*

*Once she decides that dual cultivation with me is acceptable, it would mean she has chosen her Dao companion.*

*With how much my little aunt values her Dao companion, and considering her status as a second rank expert, once she chooses me, would there be any escape for the fish in my pond?*

*If that’s the case, my head suddenly doesn’t feel big anymore…* He inwardly lampooned.

*Everything has its pros and cons. The upside is that I had gained another trump card. If worst comes to worst, I can sell myself to Luo Yuheng in exchange for her help.*

*Of course, that depends on whether she’s satisfied with me and placed me at the top of her candidate list.*

*Hmm, I’ll find a chance to test her.*

“Why are you asking so many questions?” The princess consort looked at him suspiciously.

“The National Teacher is a beauty who could topple nations. Becoming her Dao companion would be a fortune earned over eight lifetimes.” Xu Qi’an sighed theatrically.

“Stop dreaming. With what little you have, how could Luo Yuheng possibly take a liking to you?”

The princess consort’s reaction was unexpectedly strong, immediately launching into a round of cold ridicule.

Then, as if unconsciously, she touched the bodhi bracelet on her wrist and said indifferently, “Luo Yuheng may be beautiful, but saying that she could topple nations is an overstatement.”

After speaking, she lifted her chin and looked down at Xu Qi’an with a superior air.

That posture was clearly saying, _Look at me, look at me—I am the true number one beauty in the Great Feng!_

Xu Qi’an snorted disdainfully. “Go look in the mirror.”

The princess consort flew into a rage and grabbed a small stone to throw at him.

“Alright, alright, compared to you, the National Teacher is nothing.” Xu Qi’an replied perfunctorily.

Still unsatisfied, the princess consort pinched her bodhi bracelet, wanting to reveal her true appearance to show this brat whether Luo Yuheng or she was more beautiful.

“You’d better think carefully. This is the capital. If you remove your bracelet, the Sitianjian might bring soldiers to arrest you tomorrow.” Xu Qi’an warned.

The princess consort instantly chickened out.

The Jianzheng was the Jianzheng, and the Sitianjian was the Sitianjian. While the Jianzheng knew certain things, that didn’t mean the rest of the arcanists in the Sitianjian did. If they discovered the overwhelming fortune radiating from the princess consort, they might immediately report it to the palace.

Although Xu Qi’an could intervene, it would also expose the fact that he was secretly harboring the late King Huai’s widow.

Once a secret was known by others, it became difficult to keep.

Additionally, there was another secret he couldn’t speak of — he feared seeing the princess consort’s true face. That hidden woman was too dazzling, so perfect that she didn’t seem of this mortal world.

Even when facing an ordinary looking woman, Xu Qi’an could feel his fondness for her growing day by day. If he saw that peerless beauty again, he couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t do something to her tonight.

Like making her understand what it meant for fruit to ripen and fall naturally.

Although Xu Qi’an’s praise of Luo Yuheng irked the so-called number one beauty of the Great Feng, overall, she was quite happy today.

So, the next morning, before Xu Qi’an left, she made him noodles.

…

*These are overcooked and sticky—her noodle-making skills are truly terrible. And so much MSG… is she trying to kill me with sodium? I’ll have to let her taste my cooking sometime so she can learn properly.*

Muttering complaints, Xu Qi’an entered the Goulan, altered his appearance, changed his clothes, and returned home.

After four hours of cultivation, he mounted his little mare and clip-clopped his way to an upscale brothel.

He waited in a familiar private room for a long time before Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao finally arrived, wearing their Nightwatcher uniforms, bronze gongs tied to their chests, and sabres in hand.

Since they had business to discuss, they didn’t call for any girls. The three of them sat around a table, drinking and snacking on peanuts while watching the performance in the main hall below.

“How’s the matter I asked you to investigate?” Xu Qi’an kicked Song Tingfeng.

“Last night, a group of men in black robes did enter the inner city from the south gate. They even warned the guards not to speak of it. Hah, those northern folks from Chuzhou don’t know whose territory the capital is. I spent just one cash of silver to get the information from the soldiers on duty.”

Song Tingfeng took a sip of wine and smacked his lips. “They didn’t enter the imperial city. After entering the inner city, they disappeared. This morning, I asked the Silver Gongs guarding the imperial city, and indeed, none of them saw those spies enter the palace.”

*They didn’t enter the imperial city?*

*Was Hengyuan imprisoned somewhere in the inner city? No, it was also possible he had been secretly transported into the imperial city or even the imperial palace, just as Earl Pingyuan had smuggled kidnapped people into the palace.*

*The Daoist said that Master Hengyuan wouldn’t be in immediate danger. That means we have time, so we can’t rush. If Hengyuan was taken into the imperial palace, rescuing him would mean breaking all relations with Emperor Yuanjing.*

*If that’s the case, I need to prepare a retreat in advance. I can’t just rush in recklessly…*

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Xu Qi’an said, “Tell the patrols to stay alert. If they see anything unusual in the inner city, or spot black-robed, masked spies, they must inform me immediately.”

Zhu Guangxiao nodded. “Understood.”

Song Tingfeng suddenly said, “Oh, by the way, I heard that in three days, a delegation of Yao and barbarians from the north will be arriving in the capital.”

*A Yao-barbarian delegation coming to the capital? They had just joined forces to breach Chuzhou—how long had it been? And now they dared to enter the capital?* Xu Qi’an frowned.

“I haven’t heard anything about this.”

Song Tingfeng chuckled. “His Majesty convened a small court meeting yesterday to discuss it in secret. Gold Gong Jiang let it slip while we were drinking at the Jiaofangsi last night.”

*I know about the war in the north. Given the delay in information transmission, the battle should have started long ago. Even so, the fact that the northern Yao and Barbarians have sent an envoy to the capital shows that the war is going poorly…* Xu Qi’an murmured,

“The Yao and Barbarians are too weak. Asking for aid so soon?”

The northern Yao and Barbarians, the Great Feng, and the Church of the Warlock God formed a three-way balance of power.

Song Tingfeng said, “Jing’s cavalry is the strongest in all of Jiuzhou. Before the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the Barbarians’ cavalry could rival them, but after the battle, most of their experts perished. Now, Jing’s cavalry reigns supreme in Jiuzhou.

“I don’t think the war in the north will last long. The northern Barbarians won’t last through the year.”

Zhu Guangxiao added, “After Jili Zhigu’s death, the Yao and Barbarians only have Zhujiu, whereas the Church of the Warlock God still has many high-rank experts. Besides, the battlefield favours Warlocks, the Church’s ability to control corpse soldiers is terrifying.”

*Zhujiu was severely wounded in the battle of Chuzhou City and has yet to recover. That makes sense…* Xu Qi’an nodded.

Zhu Guangxiao sighed. “While the Great Feng’s national strength declines day by day, the three nations under the Church of the Warlock God are thriving. If not for Duke Wei…”

As Nightwatchers tasked with overseeing officials, Zhu Guangxiao and Song Tingfeng had keen eyes and could clearly perceive the Great Feng’s weakening state.

Year after year, it worsened.

But their concern for the nation was soon drowned out by the laughter of young women.

Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao each chose a graceful woman, wrapped their arms around them, and entered the rooms, fully engaged.

Xu Qi’an sat alone at the table, silently drinking his wine, watching the opera performance in the hall without expression.

…

That night, in Xu Erlang’s study.

Xu Qi’an held a teacup, listened to Xu Erlang’s recitation, and frowned. “That’s all?”

“The Hanlin Academy has been busy lately. The court is compiling military texts, so I haven’t had time to memorise the late emperor’s daily records,” Xu Erlang explained helplessly.

“Compiling military texts?”

“It’s customary to do so in times of war.” Xu Erlang took a sip of tea and continued,

“I’ll tell you something. Three days from now, the northern Yao and Barbarians’ envoy will arrive in the capital. The war in the north is raging, and unless something unexpected happens, the court will send troops to aid them.

“In fact, the decision was made as soon as the intelligence arrived from Chuzhou, but it needed time to be finalised. Hah, in the end, it’s just about rallying public sentiment. Tomorrow, the Imperial Academy is holding a literary gathering in the imperial city to promote pro-war ideology.”

*Huaiqing mentioned this before. Oh right, I have to accompany her to the gathering…* Xu Qi’an recalled.

He had never experienced war in his past life, but he had read plenty of ancient and modern history and understood what Xu Erlang meant.

Mobilisation in wartime was an age-old tactic, informing the people why war was necessary and what it meant.

Of course, in this era, the court’s target wasn’t the common folk but the scholar-official class.

“So, does memorising these records help you in any way, big brother?” Xu Erlang asked.

“Yes!”

Xu Qi’an gave a definite answer and said,

“From these records, it’s clear that the late emperor inquired about the Human Sect’s path to longevity a fair number of times, not too often, but not too little either. This suggests he had some fantasies about immortality.

“But for some reason, he ultimately did not entertain unnecessary illusions about it. So far, I haven’t seen any indication that he wanted to cultivate Daoism.”

“The late emperor never practised Daoism,” Xu Erlang said, then frowned. “For some reason?”

*The late emperor was a clever man, he knew his own limits…* Xu Qi’an smiled but didn’t explain. Instead, he said,

“The late emperor never cultivated Daoism, even until his death. But he certainly entertained the idea of it. I suspect he influenced Emperor Yuanjing. Keep reading the records and memorise them as soon as possible.”

The next day, heavy rain poured down. The wind swept up raindrops, bringing a chill to the air.

Rainwater flowed down the eaves, forming beaded curtains of droplets.

Summer was nearing its end, and the fields of green crops had begun to show signs of yellowing.

It was a rest day. Xu Erlang stood under the eaves and sighed. “Looks like we won’t be able to attend the literary gathering.”

Xu Qi’an stepped out of the room, stood beside him watching the rain, and laughed. “I was thinking the same thing. So, Erlang, lend me your official plaque.”

Across from them, in the eastern wing, Xu Lingyin stood under the eaves, waving a tree branch and constantly “cutting” the curtain of raindrops, utterly absorbed in her game.

Her small shoes and trouser hems were soaked by the rain.

At this hour, Lina was still sound asleep, Li Miaozhen was meditating in her room, and Second Uncle Xu had donned a raincoat and hat to dutifully head to work.

Xu Qi’an had business to attend to today. He needed to visit Lingbao Temple for two things: first, to probe Luo Yuheng’s true attitude towards him; second, to inquire about the previous Daoist Leader of the Human Sect.

…

The torrential rain continued as Wei Yuan’s carriage moved through the downpour. Raindrops shattered against the roof, creating a steady pattering sound.

The man in deep azure robes opened the window and silently watched the rain, his gaze blurred by the curtain of water.

For a brief moment, it seemed as if time itself had frozen, like an illusion.

“Rain can wash away dust, but it cannot cleanse the human heart.”

A voice filled with age and sorrow echoed inside the carriage.

Still watching the rain, Wei Yuan replied indifferently, “Is the rain in Qingyun Mountain not as picturesque as here?”

Dean Zhao Shou, who had appeared without a sound, wore a solemn expression. “After the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the Great Feng should have thrived, but because… because…”

He tried several times to speak but found he couldn’t recall.

“Because something happened,” Wei Yuan said calmly. “At the end of the official evaluation year, the statue in the Abyss cracked, and so did the one in the northeast. In the end, all I did was buy the Great Feng and the human race twenty more years. All these years, I’ve wondered — if the Jianzheng hadn’t stood by and watched, things might have been different.”

Wei Yuan’s expression remained unchanged as he said plainly, “Men may plan, but Heaven decides. Nothing in this world follows your will, Zhao Shou. Nor does it follow mine. The Jianzheng and we are not the same kind of people.”

Zhao Shou nodded and said, “The Gu God is an ancient deity, but it is rootless, a wandering spirit. The Warlock God is different. He rules the northeast and governs millions of lives. He holds at least one third of humanity’s fortune.

“If he breaks free from his seal, no one in Jiuzhou can stop him. Unless the Confucian Sage comes back to life.”

Wei Yuan sighed. “I will stop him. I started making arrangements last year.”

Zhao Shou stared at him and asked, “What if you fail?”

Wei Yuan smiled. “Have you ever seen me lose?”

…

The carriage slowly stopped outside the palace gates.

Nangong Qianrou loosened the reins, opened the carriage door, and said, “Father, we’ve arrived.”

He glanced into the carriage, seeing only Wei Yuan. No one else was there. But as he had been driving, his martial instincts had caught a fleeting sense of something unusual, there and gone in an instant.

Nangong Qianrou opened a large umbrella and guided Wei Yuan out. Raindrops drummed against the oil-paper canopy.

Wei Yuan took the umbrella and said flatly, “Wait here for me.”

He walked into the palace alone, his azure robes swaying in the storm, as if facing the raging winds and rain of the world by himself.
