# 478. Xu Qi'an Awakes

In the year of the official evaluation, Silver Gong Zhu Chengzhu of the Nightwatchers was severely injured in a single strike by Bronze Gong Xu Qi’an for attempting to violate an innocent girl. Due to the severity of his injuries, his cultivation was largely crippled.

Xu Qi’an was then imprisoned by Wei Yuan in the Nightwatchers' dungeons and sentenced to be chopped at the waist after seven days.

Coincidentally, the Sangpo case broke out. Following Wei Yuan's hint, Huaiqing recommended Xu Qi’an to Emperor Yuanjing as the lead investigating officer. The emperor granted him the chance to redeem himself through meritorious service.

After the Sangpo case concluded, Xu Qi’an was exonerated with ease. Zhu Chengzhu’s father, Gold Gong Zhu Yang, was indignant and defected to the Qi Clique, betraying the Nightwatchers.

This act of revenge came to an end when Xu Qi’an, with his immense fortunate luck, inadvertently uncovered a conspiracy between the Qi Clique and the Church of the Warlock God.

After the incident, Zhu Yang was dismissed from office and expelled from the Nightwatchers' constabulary. Originally, per Wei Yuan’s intention, Zhu Yang wasn’t supposed to live to see that day.

But Emperor Yuanjing forcibly protected him and gave him an idle post as a records clerk in the Ministry of War, where he remained to this day.

Yuan Xiong stepped down from the carriage using a wooden stool. He looked up at the plaque above Zhu Manor, a flood of emotion rising in his heart: *His Majesty truly plans far ahead.*

He arrived at the front gate of the Zhu residence and announced his name. Yuan Xiong watched the gatekeeper head inside.

Moments later, Zhu Yang, tall and broad-shouldered with a restrained aura, came out personally to greet him. A hearty smile veiled his surprise as he said:

“I'm honoured to have Censor-in-Chief Yuan grace my humble abode, a true honour.”

Yuan Xiong nodded with a smile. “Sorry to trouble you, Sir Zhu.”

He looked into the manor.

Zhu Yang promptly said, “Do come in.”

The two entered the parlour. Zhu Yang instructed the servants to serve the finest tea. After each had sipped, Yuan Xiong asked:

“How is your son’s condition?”

With this as his opening, Zhu Yang, experienced as he was, seemed to realise something and shook his head helplessly.

“That boy of mine was cut down by that brat named Xu and suffered injuries to his heart and lungs. Though the wounds eventually healed, he was left with lasting damage, his martial path is broken.”

At the time, Zhu Chengzhu had just entered the Refining Qi realm, his cultivation wasn’t deep. It was already fortunate that he’d survived.

With such grave injuries, chronic conditions were inevitable. The higher one’s cultivation, the stronger one’s vitality. Had it been Zhu Yang himself, he would’ve recovered within three days.

“He won’t be cocky for much longer.”

Yuan Xiong let out a chuckle and went straight to the point: “I trust Sir Zhu has heard of Wei Yuan’s death at the Church of the Warlock God’s main altar?”

A flash of glee and hatred passed through Zhu Yang’s eyes. He sneered. “Good riddance. That’s karma. Retribution never fails.”

Zhu Chengzhu had been his most gifted son. He’d hoped this son would inherit his mantle and one day become a Gold Gong, he had poured everything into grooming him. At twenty-three, he was already at the Refining Qi realm, with a bright future ahead.

All ruined at Xu Qi’an’s hands.

Zhu Yang had been promoted by Wei Yuan, first recognised during the Battle of Shanhai Pass and then steadily rising through the ranks until he became a Fourth-Rank Gold Gong. Wei Yuan’s favour had been as deep as a mountain. But precisely because of that, he hated Wei Yuan all the more.

He’d served loyally for so many years, only to be cast aside for a Bronze Gong?

What was so wrong about defiling the family of a disgraced official? A trivial matter! Yet Wei Yuan had taken the side of an outsider and turned a blind eye to their long-standing bond.

When he’d heard that Wei Yuan had died at Mount Jing City, Zhu Yang laughed madly at the sky and got drunk with his son Zhu Chengzhu.

“Wei Yuan’s retribution has come. The Nightwatchers’ retribution is coming too.”

Yuan Xiong tapped the lid of his teacup against the rim. “Sir Zhu, it’s time for you to rise again.”

Zhu Yang narrowed his eyes, staring at Yuan Xiong intently. “Censor-in-Chief Yuan, what do you mean by that?”

Yuan Xiong smiled and looked at him. “His Majesty has ordered me to succeed Wei Yuan and take charge of the Nightwatchers' constabulary, and to clean out the corruption within. Everyone knows the constabulary has long been Wei Yuan’s personal domain. He kept a tight grip on it for twenty years, not even a fly could get in from the outside.”

Zhu Yang nodded slowly.

Yuan Xiong sighed. “Though I’ve been tasked with rooting out corruption, a general without troops can do nothing. I must spare some and take down others, and for that, I need your help.”

Zhu Yang frowned, troubled. “Wei Yuan dismissed me and cast me out of the Nightwatchers’ constabulary. That was a personal feud, it had nothing to do with the brothers within. Duke Yuan, this places me in a difficult position.”

*Yet you had no trouble betraying your brothers so cleanly back then?* Yuan Xiong took another sip of tea and said cheerfully:

“There’s another reason I’ve come to you. Back then, you and your son were persecuted by Wei Yuan and forced to leave the constabulary. Now that Wei Yuan is dead, your grievances can be redressed, and injustices overturned.

“I intend to submit a petition to His Majesty, to have you reinstated. I also hope Sir Zhu will assist me in managing the Nightwatchers' constabulary.”

At last, Zhu Yang smiled. “Which people does Duke Yuan intend to spare, and which to take down?”

Yuan Xiong replied calmly, “Naturally those mired in corruption. I imagine most of them were Wei Yuan’s trusted men.”

The two exchanged a knowing smile.

…

The Nightwatchers constabulary.

The patrolling Bronze Gongs returned in twos and threes.

Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao were among them, summoned back by the constabulary clerks.

The reason was unclear for now; the clerk only said that Gold Gong Zhao had called all Nightwatchers stationed outside back to the constabulary.

“Why would Gold Gong Zhao summon us back?”

“Must be something urgent. Definitely urgent.”

“Truly a season of turmoil.”

The Bronze Gongs murmured quietly among themselves, without much to say.

Wei Yuan’s death was a blow that the Nightwatchers still couldn’t accept, it was as if they’d lost their pillar overnight.

The mood in the constabulary had been sombre for days.

That man, even though he never left the Tower of Noble Spirit, gave the Nightwatchers the sense that as long as he was there, the heavens above them wouldn’t collapse.

Now at the Refining Spirit realm, Song Tingfeng sipped his tea and suddenly recalled the days when Xu Ningyan was still around.

Back then, he, Zhu Guangxiao, and Xu Ningyan would patrol the streets during the day, and during their noon break, head to the goulan to listen to music. Their purses had been empty, their manhood limp, but they’d been genuinely happy.

In Xu Ningyan’s words: if you don't get around in youth, you’ll only shed tears in old age.

The fellow had clearly been a coarse martial man, yet he often came out with baffling lines that somehow sounded profound.

That time he’d said, “So, are you able to?”, Song Tingfeng still hadn’t figured out what it meant. When he visited the brothel to support some impoverished girl, he would ask:

“So, are you able to?”

And the girls would always say, “Of course, of course.”

But when he pulled up his trousers and offered no silver, suddenly they couldn’t.

How Silver Gong Xu had used just those five words to enjoy Lady Fuxiang’s company for over half a year without paying remained a mystery in the Nightwatchers’ constabulary to this day.

Now even Lady Fuxiang had passed away.

In less than a year, everything had changed.

Perhaps the Nightwatchers have not all returned yet, as Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao had been sitting in Spring Breeze Hall for a quarter of an hour.

Song Tingfeng was now at the Refining Spirit stage, and in the Nightwatchers’ Constabulary, he was considered a rare young talent. Although he was far less brilliant than Xu Qi’an, back when Wei Yuan was still around, the constabulary had planned to nurture Song Tingfeng.

For every Nightwatcher with outstanding talent and no serious misdeeds, Wei Yuan would do his utmost to cultivate them. This had always been his principle.

However, Song Tingfeng lacked both seniority and merit, so he remained at the position of Bronze Gong.

“Guangxiao, the only thing we can look forward to in the second half of the year is your wedding,” Song Tingfeng sighed.

He had thought that after the capital’s assessment year had passed, life would become more stable, but it turned out the assessment was just the beginning. Too many things had happened this year: the Yunzhou case at the start of the year, King Huai's massacre of Chuzhou City in the middle of the year, and this turmoil after the autumn harvest.

Song Tingfeng looked through the open doors at the withered leaves in the courtyard and murmured, “A season of troubles, it truly is a season of troubles. Guangxiao, the two of us brothers will get through it.”

The increasingly taciturn Zhu Guangxiao gave a brief “Mm.”

As they spoke, the sound of a drum came from the training ground.

“Gold Gong Zhao is summoning us.”

The two immediately left Spring Breeze Hall, joining Li Yuchun and the other Nightwatchers of the constabulary, heading towards the training ground.

When Song Tingfeng arrived at the training ground, his gaze swept over the scene and he was surprised to find more Nightwatchers gathered than he had expected. Even those who were off duty had been called back.

*What's happened…?* He glanced at Zhu Guangxiao and Li Yuchun beside him; they had the same puzzled look.

The three from Spring Breeze Hall silently joined the ranks. After nearly another quarter of an hour, the sound of urgent, rhythmic footsteps suddenly echoed.

Turning towards the noise, they saw a group of Imperial Guards, armour and sabres gleaming, flooding in, by rough count, at least five hundred men.

*Imperial Guards?* Song Tingfeng frowned inwardly.

The Imperial Guards surged in, surrounding the Nightwatchers, but made no further move.

While the Nightwatchers were still confused, a group of people approached at a steady pace from a distance.

In the centre was a middle-aged man with a dignified air, dressed in crimson robes. On his left was the expressionless Gold Gong Zhao, on his right Zhu Yang, with Zhu Chengzhu at Zhu Yang’s side.

Not only Li Yuchun, Song Tingfeng, and Zhu Guangxiao, but all the other Nightwatchers' faces changed upon seeing this father and son duo.

As they drew near, Yuan Xiong came before the Nightwatchers with his hands behind his back.

Gold Gong Zhao glanced at his subordinates, his face expressionless as he called out in a loud voice, “By order of His Majesty, from today onward, Censor Yuan will take over Duke Wei’s duties, managing the Nightwatchers’ Constabulary. Why do you not greet Duke Yuan?”

The Nightwatchers grew restless, exchanging looks or whispering amongst themselves.

“Bullshit, what right does he have to command the Nightwatchers?” muttered a Silver Gong.

“Just a sycophant, how is he fit to lead the Nightwatchers?”

“Even if someone were to succeed Duke Wei, surely it should be Left Censor-in-Chief Liu Hong, Sir Liu?”

Yuan Xiong narrowed his eyes, betraying no emotion.

Gold Gong Zhao glanced at his new superior, his heart sinking, and barked, “Silence, all of you! Do you intend to rebel?”

He was furious that his subordinates did not know how to read the situation. When a new official takes office, he always makes an example of the troublemakers; the more unruly, the more likely they are to be punished as a warning to others. Moreover, Yuan Xiong was here to “investigate”.

Gold Gong Zhao was also one of Wei Yuan’s trusted followers. All the Gold Gongs were, even Zhu Yang had once been.

The reason he could sleep easy, unaffected by implication, was largely due to his cultivation as a Rank Four martial artist.

In the Great Feng, and indeed in any power in Jiuzhou, a Rank Four was a mid-to-high level figure. Especially among martial artists, who were powerful, tough, and highly destructive, as long as they had not committed unforgivable crimes, the court tended to adopt a conciliatory approach towards them.

Yuan Xiong needed enough Rank Four Gold Gongs for support, so he brought him over.

In Gold Gong Zhao’s view, since the imperial decree could not be disobeyed, what choice was there but to go with the flow? Guarding this place himself was better than handing the entire Nightwatchers’ Constabulary over to Zhu Yang.

Zhu Yang’s return to the Nightwatchers was motivated by a desire for revenge, he was not the same.

Since Duke Wei has already laid down his life, recognising reality was crucial. The Nightwatchers were half of Duke Wei’s life's work; at least he could continue to guard it for him.

Yuan Xiong ignored the criticism from the Nightwatchers and called out loudly:

“At noon today, a commoner woman, Lu Madam Li, beat the drum before the Meridian Gate, accusing Wei Yuan of greed and extortion, framing the innocent, the Nightwatchers of blackmail, and defiling her daughter-in-law.

“His Majesty is enraged and has ordered me to take over the Nightwatchers’ Constabulary, cleanse it of corruption, and punish those who abuse their power for personal gain.”

Angry shouts and curses erupted instantly.

The Nightwatchers had no idea who Lu Madam Li was, but that did not stop them from cursing colourfully.

Duke Wei, greedy and corrupt?

Everyone in the constabulary knew that Duke Wei was the most honest and just man. A mere commoner dared accuse Duke Wei of corruption and persecuting her family? Did she not consider whether she was worthy?

Even if Duke Wei were to seek illicit gains, would he stoop to extorting commoners like an ordinary petty official?

The Bronze Gongs and Silver Gongs were not fools; they immediately realised that someone was trying to frame Duke Wei. That someone was very likely the man before them, Right Censor Yuan Xiong.

He was Duke Wei’s political enemy.

“Too noisy!”

Yuan Xiong said coolly.

Gold Gong Zhao was about to shout for silence, but Zhu Yang beat him to it. He stepped forward, the aura of a Rank Four master surging forth. In an instant, the Nightwatchers could not stand steady, their faces turning pale.

The clamour stopped abruptly.

Yuan Xiong nodded in satisfaction and proclaimed loudly, “This official has received a secret report. I will show no mercy to those guilty of corruption and abuse of power. Next, those whose names are called will step forward.”

“Zhang Dongliang.”

No response.

“Zhang Dongliang!”

Still no response. The Nightwatchers were resisting in silence.

Yuan Xiong said nothing more, giving a light glance at Zhu Yang at his side.

The latter took the hint. He had already locked onto a certain Silver Gong among the crowd. He spread his arms, palm aimed at the man, and suddenly snatched at him.

A burly, square-faced man was forced to be “squeezed” out of the crowd. He braced his feet against the ground, his toes leaving two grooves as he struggled to resist, but could only watch helplessly as he was dragged out.

Yuan Xiong smiled and said, “I am handling this case by imperial decree. To disobey is to defy a royal edict warrants execution!”

Gold Gong Zhao, afraid that Zhu Yang would strike again, hurriedly pulled Zhang Dongliang over and cupped his fists, saying, “My lord, this brute meant no offence, I beg you to show mercy.”

Zhang Dongliang’s face was flushed purple, veins bulging on his neck, as he gave a deep, low growl:

“I refuse to submit! Gold Gong Zhao, there is no need to beg him. If Duke Wei were still here, would Yuan Xiong dare to step even half a foot into the constabulary? If the other Gold Gongs were still here, would Zhu Yang dare to come back? I only regret not following our Boss into battle that day. To die in battle at Mount Jing with Duke Wei would have been a blessing, far better than dying at the hands of our own people.”

Yuan Xiong said lightly, “Sir Zhu, the Nightwatchers are officials. The right to decide life and death rests with His Majesty.”

Zhu Yang nodded and said, “Understood.”

He yanked Zhang Dongliang over with his aura and punched him in the chest. With a dull thud, Zhang Dongliang’s clothes split open at the back.

Everyone heard the sound of ribs breaking.

Zhang Dongliang slowly collapsed to the ground, left with just a single breath.

The new official’s first act was to burn this unfortunate soul.

“Clang!”

There was the sound of a sabre being drawn, a Silver Gong had drawn his blade.

Clang, clang, clang!

The surrounding Imperial Guards all drew their sabres, ready at any moment to suppress the Nightwatchers.

Zhu Yang narrowed his eyes and took a step forward, using his Rank Four martial artist’s might to intimidate the Nightwatchers.

“Stand down!”

Gold Gong Zhao shouted, “Do you want to rebel? Have you lost your minds?”

“Gold Gong Zhao.”

“Boss…”

The Nightwatchers reacted fiercely.

“Can’t you see? He’s purging us. Whether or not we’re guilty, there won’t be a good end.”

“Gold Gong Zhao, Duke Wei is gone. You’re the only one left in the constabulary who can stand up for your brothers. You can’t become Yuan Xiong’s running dog.”

“Boss, can you really bear to watch your brothers be framed?”

*At least you can live…* Gold Gong Zhao’s veins bulged on his forehead as he said, word by word, “Put, your, sabres, away, ”

The Nightwatchers’ hearts turned cold; there was anger, unwillingness, and sorrow, yet they still refused to sheath their blades.

Seeing this, Yuan Xiong smiled and said, “All of your families are in the capital, aren’t they?”

Attacking body and heart!

The conditions for recruitment for the Nightwatchers was that their family must have lived in the capital for at least three generations, with a clean background.

Why? To guard against these martial artists breaking the law by force.

Duke Wei died in battle, and the other Gold Gongs had either died or not returned. Even if they wanted to resist, there was no one left to support them.

“If only Xu Ningyan were still here…” someone muttered.

The Nightwatchers all fell silent, involuntarily thinking of that colleague who had cut off his badge with a single stroke of his sabre, and resigned from office.

Yes, if Xu Ningyan were still here, with Duke Wei’s kindness to him, and his unyielding nature that could not tolerate any injustice, would Zhu Yang and Yuan Xiong dare to be so arrogant?

Yuan Xiong and the others heard this as well, but neither responded nor cared to.

Zhu Chengzhu’s expression twisted noticeably.

Xu Qi’an, it was that lowly Bronze Gong who had ruined his prospects.

He hated this man to the bone, but in just one year, everything had changed. That lowly Bronze Gong was now someone he could never hope to surpass.

Even though Xu Qi’an had offended His Majesty, he was still not someone Zhu Chengzhu could touch or take revenge on.

So, this flame of vengeance burned in his heart, but he had nowhere to vent it. Day by day, it tormented his soul, slowly warping it.

… 

“Li Yuchun!”

“Chu Honghe!”

“Min Shan!”

“Tang Youde!”

“…”

One Silver Gong after another stepped forward, were disarmed, their arms twisted behind their backs by the Imperial Guards, and their hands bound. In the blink of an eye, almost half the Silver Gongs present were gone.

Some of those Silver Gongs were expressionless, some sneered, some spat, not one of them showed fear or begged for mercy.

There were no Bronze Gongs on the list. As the lowest rank among the Nightwatchers, Bronze Gongs were usually not qualified to take sides.

Of course, that did not mean Yuan Xiong would not deal with them.

This high-spirited Right Censor-in-Chief declared in a loud voice, “The Nightwatchers’ Constabulary is in turmoil, and many positions are now vacant. This official will be taking over the constabulary at this time of crisis, and I lack subordinates. I need to promote loyal and worthy men.

“Before dawn tomorrow, if any of you write a letter to report a colleague for corruption or extortion, this official will promote you.”

A truly sinister move.

The Nightwatchers present showed no expression and made no response.

But Yuan Xiong knew that the seeds of suspicion and ambition had already been sown among them.

For these Bronze Gongs, promotion was extremely difficult, it required both the right cultivation and enough merit. Some had long reached the Refining Spirit stage but had not been promoted.

Who with ambition and drive would not want to rise in rank?

Now, with the constabulary in turmoil, it was a perfect opportunity for those ambitious for promotion.

Yuan Xiong stopped paying attention to the dispirited Nightwatchers, and instead looked at Zhu Yang and Gold Gong Zhao, saying with a smile, “Gentlemen, come with me to the Tower of Noble Spirit for a look.”

He was eager to enter that place and take Wei Yuan’s position.

Gold Gong Zhao nodded, glanced at the Nightwatchers, and said, “Dismissed.”

Zhu Guangxiao heard Song Tingfeng mutter beside him, “Bow your head, quickly, bow your head, and leave…”

Feeling despondent, Zhu Guangxiao was startled, but instinctively obeyed and followed his colleagues out of the training ground.

After only a few steps, he heard a voice call out, “Stop!”

Everyone halted in fear and looked over.

The one who had shouted was Zhu Chengzhu, the former Silver Gong, whom almost all the Nightwatchers present recognised.

Zhu Chengzhu ignored the others and pointed at Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao, grinning maliciously, “You two, come out.”

Song Tingfeng’s heart sank. He braced himself and stepped forward, saying, “Silver Gong Zhu, congratulations on regaining your post. Why has Silver Gong Zhu called for me?”

He was always good at reading people and could flatter without so much as a frown.

Zhu Chengzhu revealed a malicious grin and loudly declared:

“Duke Yuan, I accuse these two of corruption and abuse of power. I witnessed it with my own eyes.”

Song Tingfeng’s face turned pale with fright.

Yuan Xiong nodded slightly and said, “Then young master Zhu may handle it.”

Without a pause, he continued on with the two Gold Gongs.

Gold Gong Zhao glanced at Zhu Yang, giving a kindly warning, “Those two are Xu Qi’an’s closest friends.”

This was both a warning to Zhu Yang and a way of protecting Zhu Guangxiao and Song Tingfeng.

Before Zhu Yang could respond, Yuan Xiong had already spoken, saying coldly, “Wei Yuan is dead. Without that backer, how much longer do you think Xu Qi’an can last?”

Zhu Yang chuckled.

Gold Gong Zhao said nothing more.

On this side, Song Tingfeng bowed and pleaded, “Silver Gong Zhu, it was my fault for what happened before. I know you are magnanimous, please don’t take offence at someone insignificant like me.”

Zhu Chengzhu toyed with him like a cat with a mouse, “What was your fault?”

Song Tingfeng froze, but quickly thumped his chest and stamped his feet in regret, “The biggest mistake I ever made in my life was befriending Xu Qi’an. I truly regret it now.”

He had no grudge with Zhu Chengzhu. The trouble he was facing was just guilt by association.

At a time like this, all he needed to do was play the part of a fence-sitter, the more weak and easily bullied he acted, the more likely he would calm Zhu Chengzhu’s anger. He wanted him to think that he only befriended Xu Qi’an because Xu Qi’an was favoured by Wei Yuan and he wanted to curry favour, not because there was any deep friendship between them.

Sure enough, Zhu Chengzhu looked very satisfied, but his next words struck Song Tingfeng like a thunderbolt.

“If you don’t want to go to prison, crawl between my legs.”

Zhu Chengzhu spread his legs, smiling maliciously, “Crawl through, and I won’t pursue your past relationship with Xu Qi’an.”

The onlooking Nightwatchers all turned to look at Song Tingfeng. Under all those gazes, his face slowly turned pale.

“Silver Gong Zhu, you- you really are a joker…”

*Slap!*

Right in front of everyone.

Song Tingfeng’s cheek swelled up instantly.

Zhu Chengzhu barked harshly, “A joke? Do you think I’m joking with you? I’ve given you a chance, it’s up to you whether you take it or not. You have three breaths.”

Song Tingfeng began to tremble, clenching and unclenching his fists again and again.

In the end, under all those eyes, he knelt down, put his hands to the ground, and crawled between Zhu Chengzhu’s legs.

Zhu Chengzhu roared with laughter.

He then looked at Zhu Guangxiao, “Your turn. Prison, or crawl through my legs.”

In that moment, his twisted mind felt greatly satisfied.

Zhu Guangxiao’s eyes were dark. He would rather die than accept such humiliation.

“I, I’ll do it, I’ll do it for him…”

Song Tingfeng, full of obsequiousness, said, “I enjoy crawling through Silver Gong Zhu’s legs. Today must be my lucky day to receive such an honour.”

“You really are a fence-sitter, is this how you flattered Xu Qi’an back then?” Zhu Chengzhu mocked.

“Yes, yes…”

Song Tingfeng nodded hastily and crawled through Zhu Chengzhu’s legs again.

“Not bad, you’re quite something. This is the first time I’ve seen anyone enjoy this.”

Zhu Chengzhu slapped Song Tingfeng’s face and sneered, “That’s what comes of choosing the wrong friends.”

He ignored this wretch and strode off after his father.

After a while, everyone had left the training ground, leaving only Zhu Guangxiao and Song Tingfeng.

“That bastard, bullying the weak!”

Song Tingfeng spat, glanced at Zhu Guangxiao, and said with a nonchalant smile, “You brat, after all this time with Xu Ningyan, you haven’t learnt any real skills, but you’ve picked up his bad temper. You’re getting married at the end of the year, if you got thrown in prison at a time like this, you’d be ruined even if you survived. In the end, you’d be dismissed from office. How would you ever marry that girl?”

“In this life, to meet a girl you want to marry, and one who’s willing to marry you, is no easy thing. Xu Ningyan, that dog, hangs about Jiaofangsi every day, but has he ever found a girl like that?”

Zhu Guangxiao’s eyes shone with tears.

Song Tingfeng spat again, “What are you being sentimental for? I’ve always been slippery, crawling between someone’s legs, even calling them dad, it’s nothing to me. Didn’t you see everyone’s faces, like they were thinking, ‘that’s exactly what I’d do’? If it were you, you’d probably lose all face.”

He waved his hand, “Go on, I want to sit alone for a bit.”

Zhu Guangxiao, his voice thick with emotion, answered “Mm,” and left.

There was no one else left in the training ground. Song Tingfeng covered his face, his shoulders trembling, and muffled sobs came through his fingers.

Utter humiliation!

…

The next day, at court.

Yuan Xiong presented a memorial, accusing Wei Yuan of ten crimes, including condoning his subordinates’ corruption and extortion, and recklessness that led to eighty thousand soldiers’ deaths far from home.

Emperor Yuanjing, at court, publicly denounced Wei Yuan for ruining the country in front of all the ministers and officials.

The whole court was shaken.

…

At the residence of Left Censor-in-Chief Liu Hong, in the study.

Liu Hong smashed an antique vase in fury. This Rank Three official, whose black hair was streaked with silver, cursed and roared,

“Despicable villain!

“I am sworn enemies with Yuan Xiong, sworn enemies!”

In the spacious study sat Censor Zhang Xingying, the Minister of War, and several former core members of the Wei Clique.

All of them were at their wits’ end.

In court, no one could wrestle power from a youthful emperor in full control, especially one with many loyal lackeys willing to die for him.

“It’s come to this, with just us, I’m afraid we can’t turn the tide,” sighed a core member.

Zhang Xingying’s face was full of sorrow, “Duke Wei served in the court for twenty years, working tirelessly. To accuse him of abusing power and greed, does anyone know he lived in the Tower of Noble Spirit for twenty years? The capital is full of splendour, yet he had no home here.”

“All these years he discussed reforms with us, striving to revive the declining court. He had no children or family, and poured all his energy and devotion into the state. Without him, would His Majesty have had such peace for twenty years?”

“Why won’t His Majesty even grant him a good name after death?”

A heavy, sorrowful mood filled the study.

The Minister of War took a deep breath, “What we must think of now is our own survival. Once Duke Wei’s case is finished, the purge of the Wei Clique will begin. Hmph, Qin Yuandao is already eyeing my post.”

“As for Duke Wei’s case, as long as we survive, there will be a day to set things right.”

Temporary victories and defeats meant nothing. As the saying goes, ‘new emperor, new ministers’.

If Emperor Yuanjing’s reign could not be changed, then wait for the next one. History had many cases of sons undoing their fathers’ wrongs.

Many wrongful cases were only redressed after decades.

“That’s all we can hope for,” Liu Hong sighed, then said, “But even if the Crown Prince ascends, he may not overturn Duke Wei’s case.”

“By the way, how's Xu Qi’an doing?” the Minister of War suddenly asked.

Zhang Xingying wiped his eyes and said quietly, “I sent someone to check recently, the gates of Xu Manor are tightly shut, the place is empty. It seems Ningyan has already left the capital.”

Liu Hong gave a bitter smile, “Perhaps it’s for the best. If he hadn’t left, no one could protect him, not even us. I suppose he is completely disappointed in the court.”

…

That day, the news that Wei Yuan, greedy for merit and reckless in his advance, had caused eighty thousand troops to be buried in a foreign land, finally reached the common people.

The public’s reaction was extremely intense.

“I said we shouldn’t support the Yao and barbarians. The Yao and barbarians eat our people, harass our borders, so why support them? Now we’ve angered our ancestors, and punishment has come, hasn’t it? Look what’s happened, eighty thousand soldiers dead. In the past twenty years, our Great Feng hasn’t suffered such a defeat.”

“If you ask me, it’s all that Wei Yuan’s fault. If he hadn’t been greedy for merit and reckless, how could we have lost?”

“That dog of a criminal, a eunuch commanding troops, isn’t that a joke? His Majesty trusted the wrong person.”

“Bastard! Is Duke Wei someone you lot can insult as you please? Twenty years ago, without this eunuch, would you have the peace you enjoy now?” An elderly man stepped forward to argue.

“Old man, haven’t you heard? Wei Yuan’s a massive corrupt official.”

“Hmph, who said that?”

“The court said so.”

“The court also said the King of Huai was a hero. The court also said the massacre in Chuzhou was committed by the Yao and barbarians. And in the end? I’ve long stopped trusting the court. I’d sooner trust Silver Gong Xu.”

The crowd fell silent.

After the Chuzhou massacre case, the people of the capital, and even across the states of Great Feng, inevitably developed a crisis of trust towards the court.

“But, but even Silver Gong Xu hasn’t spoken up.”

…

The imperial palace.

The old eunuch walked in slowly, stopped at the bedside, bowed, and said softly, “Your Majesty, the Prime Minister requests an audience.”

Emperor Yuanjing sat meditating with his eyes closed, and replied steadily, “We shall not see him.”

The old eunuch added quietly, “The Prime Minister is kneeling outside. He said if you will not see him, he will not leave.”

Emperor Yuanjing let out a cold laugh, but gave no response.

The old eunuch did not dare to advise further, and stood quietly by the side.

Time ticked by, and before long, two hours had passed. The old eunuch glanced at Emperor Yuanjing, who was still meditating, then quietly left the bedchamber.

As soon as he left, Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes, got up from the mat, and stood in his bedchamber. He squatted down, pressing his palm to the ground.

A few seconds later, Emperor Yuanjing vaguely heard a mournful dragon’s roar in his ear.

“Still not enough, still not enough!”

Emperor Yuanjing said nothing, but a voice echoed from within him.

“Wait until tomorrow. When you declare the defeat against the Church of the Warlock God, then it will be enough.” Emperor Yuanjing laughed.

Meanwhile, the old eunuch had left the bedchamber. At the foot of the high steps, a figure in crimson robes was kneeling.

“Prime Minister, why do you do this? If word gets out, it will not look good for either you or His Majesty.”

The old eunuch bowed, advising earnestly, “Go back. I have served His Majesty most of my life, and I know his temper. Even if you kneel here until you die, you will never shake His Majesty’s resolve.”

Prime Minister Wang’s face was pale, his eyelids half open, as if he might faint at any moment.

At his age, being able to kneel for two hours, one could only call it astonishing willpower.

“I understand. Thank you for your advice, my Lord.”

The light in Prime Minister Wang’s eyes gradually faded. He struggled to get up, but as he moved, he toppled over.

“Oh dear, careful, Prime Minister, your health is precious. If anything happened to you, who would help His Majesty bear his burdens?”

The old eunuch hurriedly helped him up.

Wang Zhenwen exhaled, dusted the dirt from his clothes, straightened his robes and hat, then bowed deeply towards the Imperial Study.

Next, he did something that left the old eunuch dumbstruck.

Wang Zhenwen took off his official hat and gently placed it on the steps.

As he stood up, his eyes were bright.

Wang Zhenwen rose, no longer lingering, and strode away.

Without office, he felt a burden lifted.

…

Stargazing Tower.

Two carriages rolled up slowly, both made of rosewood, edged with jade, adorned with bright yellow silk.

The carriages stopped at the plaza outside the Stargazing Tower. Two rows of guards on fine horses reined in and stopped alongside.

The doors opened, and out from each carriage stepped a woman. The beauty in a plain palace gown was as aloof as a snow lotus, proud and cold. The woman in a bright red gown wore a small phoenix coronet, jade hairpins, and pearl ornaments, extravagant and costly.

Like a noble golden canary.

Yet her beauty and charm perfectly matched this luxurious array of ornaments. It made people feel that a woman with such natural allure should indeed be so splendidly adorned.

Leaving the guards behind, the two princesses entered the Stargazing Tower.

“Huaiqing, you’re here!”

Chu Caiwei waited in the first-floor hall, happily greeting her close friend.

Biaobiao cared nothing for her princessly bearing, lifted her skirt, and ran “thump, thump, thump” up the stairs.

After a few steps, she suddenly remembered, and called back, “Which floor is he on?”

“Seventh!”

Chu Caiwei replied, smiling sweetly as she chatted with Huaiqing. She fished some dried meat out of her small deerskin pouch. “Want some?”

Huaiqing shook her head.

Biaobiao stamped her foot. “Then lead the way!”

Chu Caiwei led the two princesses to the seventh floor and opened the bedroom door. The room was full of the scent of medicine. Biaobiao’s gaze immediately fell on the man, barely clinging to life, on the bed.

Her eyes grew misty with tears.

“Why hasn’t he woken up yet? Is he still in danger…” Biaobiao choked.

Huaiqing said nothing and looked at Chu Caiwei.

“I've no idea when he’ll wake up. When he was brought back, he was truly at death’s door. Not a single part of his body was uninjured. During the defence, he used Confucian magic and suffered heavy backlash. Also, the wound on his waist was troublesome and still hasn’t healed.”

The big-eyed girl looked worried as she explained, “Teacher said his intent is far too domineering.”

Huaiqing asked, “What is his ‘intent’?”

Chu Caiwei shook her head. “Teacher only said it hurts others and himself, mutual destruction.”

*Mutual destruction…* Huaiqing was moved.

When Xu Qi’an advanced to fourth rank, what state had he been in, what frame of mind had allowed him to take that step?

Biaobiao was already sitting at the bedside, clutching a handkerchief, crying her heart out.

She wanted to call out to Xu Qi’an, to shake him awake, but was afraid it would do him harm, so all she could do was cry.

Biaobiao sobbed, “Father won’t let him be an official any more, and he still risked his life. Wei Yuan’s lifelong reputation is ruined in an instant. If he wakes up and finds out, how heartbroken he’ll be.

“How could Father be so ruthless? I may not like Wei Yuan, but I know he accomplished truly great things.”

“Duke- Duke Wei…”

As Biaobiao wept, suddenly a hoarse voice sounded behind her.

Biaobiao was overjoyed. Huaiqing and Chu Caiwei also stepped forward, approaching the bedside. They saw Xu Qi’an’s face was pale, his lips dry and cracked, but his eyes were now open.

“Oh, you’re finally awake!”

Chu Caiwei cried out in delight. “I’ll get you some nourishing pills.”

Her face beamed with joy as she hurried out of the room.

Xu Qi’an gazed at the two princesses, each with her own unique beauty. After a brief silence, he asked, “Am I at the Sitianjian?”

Biaobiao nodded hurriedly, “Mm-hmm!”

Her long eyelashes were wet, and her fair cheeks were streaked with tears.

Xu Qi’an smiled at her, then breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that Li Miaozhen had managed to bring him back.

*Although I managed to cling to life, it was still far too risky. I must have been hovering at death’s door for quite a while,* he thought.

It was no easy task to kill Nurhaci amidst tens of thousands of soldiers. First, he had to break through the army, then kill a dual-system, fourth-rank expert at the peak of his cultivation. That alone was beyond any ordinary fourth-rank expert.

What was more, Nurhaci practised both warlock and martial systems, and possessed many means of control. His self-destructive ‘One Blade from Heaven and Earth’ might not even have worked.

That was why he needed Li Miaozhen’s golden core for protection.

Finally, the strategy of using Confucian magic was also crucial. He used Laws followed Commandments, which allowed him to reach a temporary peak state at a much smaller cost than “my spirit is ten times stronger”.

Back then, he had almost lost his soul for good. Fortunately, as the favoured child of fortune, his fate would not let him die, and he happened to have a beautiful Heaven Sect girl by his side.

This time, clearly, he had not died on the spot. Otherwise, when he opened his eyes, he would not have seen Biaobiao and Huaiqing, but a midwife and his next-life’s father.

Before long, Chu Caiwei returned with a wooden tray filled with bottles and jars, her steps light.

“It’s good that you’re awake. Since you could wake up, it means the two forces destroying your vitality have completely vanished. With your physique as a fourth-rank, you’ll recover in two or three days.”

Chu Caiwei looked delighted. While Xu Ningyan was gravely injured in bed, even dried fish tasted bland to her. She was listless every day and could only manage two bowls of rice per meal. She had even lost weight.

Now that Xu Ningyan was awake, she could enjoy her food again and no longer had to worry about him.

With Chu Caiwei’s guidance, he took a few pills and soon felt a warm sensation in his abdomen. The blocked qi began to flow again in his meridians, and his complexion looked much healthier.

He was no longer hungry, either.

He drank the warm water that Biaobiao handed him and, under her “service”, sat up in bed, leaning against the headboard with a soft pillow behind him.

“I just heard Her Highness Lin’an mention Duke Wei…”

Lin’an immediately glanced at Huaiqing, her face full of hesitation.

After a moment’s thought, Huaiqing said quietly, “His Majesty is unwilling to grant Duke Wei a posthumous title. Even if he does, it will likely be a negative one.”

Wrapped up in worry for Xu Qi’an, Biaobiao did not even notice that her elder sister Huaiqing referred to their father as “His Majesty”.

A negative posthumous title was one with a derogatory meaning.

To ministers of this era, a posthumous title was the final judgment on a life’s merit and character.

A negative posthumous title would mean Wei Yuan’s entire life would be branded as that of a villain, to be reviled in the annals of history.

Huaiqing explained to Xu Qi’an what had happened in recent days in detail.

“I see. Unexpected, but understandable,” Xu Qi’an said calmly, before falling silent.

After a long time, he said, “Duke Wei died in Mount Jing City. That’s a good thing, better than dying at the hands of his own people. But if he hadn’t died, those petty villains wouldn’t have dared touch him.

“When you think about it, his life was full of hardship. He was originally from Yuzhou. When he was young, his family was slaughtered by the Church of the Warlock God. He went to the capital to seek help from family friends, but because he fell in love with their daughter and tried to elope, he was castrated. He watched his beloved marry another, and had to guard her side himself. For a man, that must be the greatest humiliation.

“He had no children, no family. In the end, even this happened to him. It shouldn’t have been like this…”

Xu Qi’an’s eyes reddened, and he forced a smile. “Huaiqing, please tell Chu Yuanzhen all about Zhende’s case and what happened to Duke Wei. Ask if he’s willing to return to the capital before tomorrow.”

He looked at Lin’an, holding her small hand and squeezing it gently. “Your Highness, help me grind some ink.”

“Oh!”

Lin’an had listened the whole time, half-understanding, but she understood clearly that he was now deeply saddened.

Xu Qi’an lifted the covers and got up, then sat at the table and began to write a letter.

After a while, he finished, put the letter in an envelope, and looked at Chu Caiwei. “Is Miaozhen still in the Stargazing Tower?”

*Miaozhen…* Biaobiao frowned slightly, thinking that this address was too intimate, and did not sound pleasant to her.

“Yeah. I’ll go and call her,” Chu Caiwei said, and left at once.

Li Miaozhen was meditating in her room. On hearing that Xu Qi’an had woken, she was overjoyed and hurried over.

She pushed open the door and found herself face to face with two stunningly beautiful princesses.

Lady Flying Swallow restrained her happiness, glanced calmly at Xu Qi’an by the table, and nodded. “It’s good that you’re awake. Why did you want to see me?”

Xu Qi’an handed her the letter, his voice slightly hoarse:

“Please deliver this letter to the old ancestor of the Wulin Alliance. He’s behind the stone gate on the rear mountain, guarded by the Quanrong.

“When you go, make sure you hand it to him personally. You must not entrust it to anyone else, including the current alliance leader Cao Qingyang. Remember, it must go straight into the old alliance leader’s hands. Give my name, and Cao Qingyang will take you to see him.”

“Can I read it?” The Heaven Sect Holy Maiden asked straightforwardly.

*What do you think?* Xu Qi’an shook his head. “Don’t read it.”

“Alright.”

Li Miaozhen nodded and left the room.

Xu Qi’an then looked at the two princesses, supporting himself on the edge of the table as he stood up weakly. “Your Highnesses, please wait a moment. I’m going to see the Jianzheng.”
