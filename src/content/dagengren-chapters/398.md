# 398. Earth Book Fragment Holder -- Xu Qi'an

Jianzhou, Yue Clan Manor.

Daoist Bailian, a woman of about forty with a round face and a curvaceous figure, wore a black Daoist robe. Her dark hair was coiled into a bun, secured with a simple ebony hairpin, exuding both elegance and maturity.

Usually gentle and affable, with a perpetual smile, Bailian now bore a solemn expression as she walked silently through the outer perimeters of the manor.

A dozen disciples followed behind her, clearing debris as they attempted to reestablish the formation.

The area had just endured a bombardment—cannonballs rained down like falling meteors, leaving behind massive craters. The shockwaves ripped apart the stone slabs paving the ground, toppling houses and trees.

One Heaven and Earth Society disciple was unfortunately struck by a cannon, and was obliterated, leaving no remains, while two others were gravely wounded.

Since fleeing the Earth Sect, these disciples—who had retained their sanity and resisted falling into demonic corruption—renamed themselves the Heaven and Earth Society.

But more critically, the formation Daoist Leader Jinlian had laid within the manor had been torn open, creating a breach that could no longer repel the incoming enemies—including those weak but numerous jianghu folk.

Scattered jianghu cultivators were always a troublesome force. Their sheer numbers, devious methods, and relentless pursuit of resources made them formidable.

Without a powerful patron, they could not afford to pass up any opportunity to rise.

“Senior Uncle Bailian…”[^1]

A young disciple clad in a light blue Daoist robe ran up to her, eyes brimming with tears. He choked out, “Brother Ling Zhen… he, he…”

Before he could finish, he broke down in sobs.

Ling Zhen had been among the severely injured. His wounds were too grave—he had not survived. And since he had never cultivated a Yin Spirit, his death was absolute, no different from that of an ordinary mortal.

Behind Bailian, the eyes of the dozen disciples reddened.

After the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader succumbed to demonic corruption, most disciples had followed suit, transforming into demonic entities. Only thirty-six of them had managed to retain their sanity. Every loss was an irreparable blow.

Now, only thirty-four orthodox Earth Sect disciples remained.

“He will accompany us in another form,” the graceful woman sighed.

“Senior Uncle Bailian, didn’t you say that Daoist Jinlian had summoned the holders of the Earth Book fragments for aid? Where are they? Why aren’t they here yet?”

A female disciple, tears streaking her face, asked in a trembling voice.

The other disciples turned their gazes towards her as well, hope flickering faintly in their eyes.

Bailian had emphasized time and again that the holders of the Earth Book fragments were all peerless talents, unmatched in ability.

Surely, they would help safeguard the lotus seeds and see them through this crisis.

“They’ll come, they’ll come…”

Bailian repeatedly reassured them. She kept her true worries hidden—she had not expected the bombardment at all.

According to Daoist Leader Jinlian’s plan, the entire Yue Clan Manor was a formation. If each Earth Book fragment holder guarded a key position, they could leverage the formation’s power to hold back the enemies until the lotus seeds matured.

Once the lotus seeds fully matured, Daoist Jinlian would recover some of his strength, and they would no longer need to defend the manor to the death. They could fight while retreating, ultimately making a successful escape.

“Our priority now is to repair the formation and seal this breach,” Bailian instructed.

The disciples fell silent and resumed their work—clearing rubble, restoring the damaged formation.

Watching their weary yet determined backs, the graceful woman furrowed her brows and let out a quiet sigh.

Truthfully, even she had no idea who the Earth Book holders were or whether they could actually save them.

“Meow…”

At that moment, several orange cats darted out from the bushes, watching the disciples with silent curiosity.

These cats had been brought back by Daoist Jinlian and had been living at the manor for some time. They roamed the area freely but never left, as if they had already made this place their home.

Bailian couldn’t understand how a single trip outside had turned Daoist Jinlian into a cat lover. But the female disciples adored them, often playing with them in their spare time.

Seeing the cats, Bailian chuckled softly.

“Senior Uncle Bailian, is repairing the formation even worth it? Even if we fix it, the next barrage will destroy everything again…”

A young disciple threw down the materials in his hands in frustration, his eyes reddened with grief and rage.

“We are not Arcanists from Sitianjian! We cannot carve a formation strong enough to resist cannon fire.

“How are we supposed to hold the lotus seeds? Against the demonic Daoists of the Earth Sect, against the Wulin Alliance, against the imperial forces that suddenly appeared—what chance do we have?!”

His despair spread like wildfire. The other disciples stopped working, silently looking at Bailian.

The graceful yet resolute Daoist nun stiffened. She realized that her disciples were on the verge of breaking.

For days, jianghu cultivators had flooded the nearby town, gathering just a few miles away.

Among them were the Wulin Alliance, the corrupted Earth Sect Daoists, and an imperial force equipped with enchanted artillery.

The Yue Clan Manor had sent disciples to infiltrate the town in disguise, posing as martial artists to gather intelligence.

And because of that, they knew just how powerful their enemies were.

Days of fear and worry had festered in their hearts. The bombardment had simply been the spark that ignited their despair.

“Do not worry. We still have the holders of the Earth Book fragments. We are not alone—”

Before she could finish, a young female disciple suddenly interrupted.

The girl crouched on the ground, crying out loudly, “There are no Earth Book holders, are there, Master?

“If there really were reinforcements, if there really were Earth Book holders, then why do you know nothing about them?

“You’ve never told us anything about them—because you were lying to us!”

Bailian frowned slightly, scanning the faces of her disciples.

They were all looking at her.

Their eyes were filled not just with doubt, but with despair.

*So they were thinking this all along…* Bailian’s pupils sharpened. She snapped coldly:

“Even if there are no Earth Book holders, does that mean you cannot fight? The Earth Sect has always upheld virtue and justice. Have our disciples ever feared death?”

The disciples fell silent.

After a moment, a young disciple shook his head and let out a bitter laugh:

“Senior Uncle Bailian, we are not afraid to die. What we fear is dying for nothing.

“At this point, there are only twenty-four of us left. If we all perish here for the Nine-Coloured Lotus, what then? Is that truly what you and Daoist Jinlian want?”

Another disciple clenched his fists, tears glistening in his eyes. “If all our brothers and sisters die in this manor, even if we preserve the lotus, what good will it do? Our lineage will be extinguished.”

The female disciple who had protested earlier sobbed uncontrollably, crying out, “Master, let’s retreat… Please, speak to Daoist Jinlian. Let’s leave, alright?”

Bailian was not angry—only filled with sorrow. Once, these young ones had been spirited and fearless, the future pillars of the Earth Sect. But after their Daoist Leader succumbed to demonic corruption, they had spent their days on the run, watching their fellow disciples and elders fall to darkness, their former kin turn their blades against them.

After years of fleeing, they had become frightened, broken souls.

Their will was being gradually worn down, their courage slowly eroded. They desperately needed a victory to restore their confidence and rebuild their faith.

Suddenly, Bailian’s ears twitched as she caught a faint sound in the wind. Instinctively, she looked up and saw a streak of sword light roaring toward them.

Sword flight?

Bailian’s heart tensed. Sword flight was a technique exclusive to the Daoist sects, practiced by all three branches—Heaven, Human, and Earth. At this critical moment, the arrival of a sword-flying expert was more likely to indicate an Earth Sect demon daoist.

The young disciples around her immediately went on high alert, summoning their own artifacts. If a fight became inevitable, they would not fear death.

The figure on the flying sword seemed to sense being locked onto by over a dozen qi signatures. Unhurried, they reached into their robes and pulled out a small jade mirror, holding it up for all to see.

The young disciples remained tense, unrecognizing of the item, but Bailian’s pupils contracted slightly—she had identified it. It was a fragment of the Earth Book, the supreme treasure of the Earth Sect.

"It’s... it’s the holder of an Earth Book fragment…!" Bailian exclaimed in surprise and delight. At the same time, she pressed her hand down, signaling the disciples not to act rashly and mistakenly harm an ally.

*An Earth Book holder… had arrived?*

The disciples' expressions varied between surprise, confusion, and excitement. There really was a holder of an Earth Book fragment.

Though Senior Uncle Bailian had repeatedly assured them of incoming reinforcements, she had never revealed the identity of the fragment holder, no matter how much they pressed.

As time passed, while they outwardly said nothing, doubt had taken root in their hearts.

And now, at their lowest moment, the Earth Book holder had truly appeared.

The flying sword landed at the edge of the ruins, and two beautiful figures leaped down gracefully. The one in the lead wore Daoist robes, possessing an exquisite oval face, bright red lips, dazzling eyes, and skin as fair as snow. The arch of her brows carried a hint of sharpness, exuding heroic spirit.

The other young woman bore the features of the Southern Marches—delicate and breathtakingly beautiful, with a lively air about her. Her deep blue eyes shimmered like the ocean, vibrant and full of spirit.

However, her tanned skin and lithe, agile figure made her resemble a wild young leopard from the jungle.

"Li Miaozhen, the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect…"

"It’s Senior Sister Miaozhen? It’s really her?"

"That’s great! Senior Sister Miaozhen is the Earth Book holder of our Earth Sect?"

The disciples recognized Li Miaozhen. Though the three Daoist branches had distinct philosophies, the Heaven and Human Sects were particularly at odds. However, they were not completely estranged.

The disciples of the three sects would occasionally visit one another. Though Heaven and Human Sect meetings often ended in discord, the shared Daoist lineage maintained a delicate connection between them.

It wasn’t an absolute severance.

Not long ago, the Conflict of Heaven and Man between Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen had stirred up great commotion. The disciples of Heaven and Earth Society, despite their seclusion, had heard all about it.

Li Miaozhen performed a Daoist salute, smiling with composed elegance. "Greetings, senior and junior brothers and sisters."

The young disciples of Heaven and Earth Society returned the gesture before turning their attention to Lina.

Understanding their curiosity, Li Miaozhen introduced her. "She is from the Strength Gu Tribe of the Southern Marches."

The group immediately greeted Lina, and the Southern Marches girl bowed in return.

"A- are there only two of you?" A young disciple asked cautiously.

If there were only two reinforcements, it wouldn’t make much of a difference to the situation. Although Li Miaozhen, as a Rank Four expert, was an outstanding rising star, the current crisis was dire, with formidable foes all around.

"They’ll be here soon." Li Miaozhen smiled.

*They…?* The disciples of Heaven and Earth Society perked up. This meant there were more reinforcements. Their anticipation for the other Earth Book holders grew.

As for the Southern Marches girl, her strength remained unclear, but Li Miaozhen was already a well-known figure—surely the others wouldn’t be lacking.

As they pondered, another sword rider approached, circling once over the Yue Clan Manor before descending swiftly toward them.

Two men stood atop the sword. The first, clad in azure robes, had a refined yet strikingly handsome face, with a strand of white hair falling over his forehead.

Behind him stood a burly middle-aged monk with ordinary features and a serene aura, displaying no apparent distinctiveness.

"Chu Yuanzhen, an honorary disciple of the Human Sect. Fellow Earth Sect brothers should be familiar with him." Li Miaozhen introduced with a smile.

"Chu Yuanzhen?"

A delicate female disciple gasped.

Before the Conflict of Heaven and Man, Chu Yuanzhen’s fame had been limited to the capital. But after his duel with Li Miaozhen, the Human Sect’s honorary disciple had quickly risen to prominence.

His past achievements were soon unearthed—zhuangyuan of Yuanjing’s twenty-seventh year, who resigned the following year to pursue the martial path. After years of obscurity, he had rapidly ascended and was lauded by Wei Yuan as the capital’s number one swordsman.

A man of legend.

*The Daoist Leader had actually brought the brightest talents of the Heaven and Human Sects into Heaven and Earth Society…* Daoist Bailian was elated. Li Miaozhen was destined for a high position within the Heaven Sect.

*Could her joining the Heaven and Earth Society be a directive from the Heaven Sect? Did they also see the Earth Sect’s mass corruption as damaging to the Daoist name and decide to intervene?*

*Likewise, did the Human Sect’s Daoist Leader, Luo Yuheng, hold the same belief?*

Daoist Bailian saw beyond what ordinary disciples could.

"Our Heaven and Earth Society is facing a grave crisis. I deeply appreciate the four of you for traveling so far to aid us—we will never forget this debt." Bailian stepped forward and bowed solemnly.

After a pause, she continued, "The current situation is dire. Even just among the Wulin Alliance, their fourth rank experts outnumber us. Not to mention the corrupted demon daoists and opportunistic rogue cultivators.

"Do what you can, but don’t push yourselves too hard. If necessary, we will abandon the Nine-Coloured Lotus."

*She clearly doubts our ability to turn the tide…* Chu Yuanzhen picked up on Daoist Bailian’s implicit meaning. Though it carried an undertone of underestimation, it was born from genuine concern.

Chu Yuanzhen chuckled. "There’s one more. He’s stronger than both Miaozhen and me. And, in the jianghu, those with any reputation will have to give him some face."

Li Miaozhen glanced around impatiently. "Why isn’t he here yet?"

Hengyuan shook his head. "Perhaps he’s still on the way."

*Who were they talking about? Someone stronger than Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen, and able to command respect across the jianghu—just what kind of figure could that be…?* The disciples exchanged looks, their anticipation rising.

With the presence of Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen, expectations soared.

"Daoist Jinlian, it’s been a long time. And you still haven’t changed this habit of yours."

A sudden laugh rang out behind them. Turning to look, they saw a young man in black combat attire, his long hair tied in a high ponytail, a slender blade strapped to his back. He was crouching in front of an orange cat, waving his hand repeatedly.

The cat, startled, arched its back and bared its teeth at him.

"Daoist, your act is really convincing…" he laughed heartily.

"T-That’s not Daoist Jinlian. It’s just a stray cat," a female disciple whispered hesitantly.

The young man with the high ponytail turned back, surprised. "Really?"

He had a strikingly handsome face, with well-proportioned lips, a high nose bridge, and deep, bright eyes. His features were sharply defined, exuding a strong masculine presence.

At that moment, a collective jolt ran through the minds of the Heaven and Earth Society disciples.

*Xu—Xu Qi’an?!*

*The Great Feng Silver Gong, Xu Qi’an!*

The disciples residing in Yue Clan Manor were no strangers to this young man, who had risen like a comet, creating one legend after another.

He truly entered Yue Clan Manor’s intelligence network after the Buddhist contest concluded, when the imperial court issued official reports, proclaiming to the world the deeds that cemented Xu Qi’an’s legendary status across the Great Feng.

Shortly after, the disciples responsible for gathering external intelligence returned with a detailed dossier on him.

Imprisoned, yet single-handedly unraveling the tax silver case and saving his family; investigating the Sangpo case by imperial decree, uncovering the long-buried murder of the Pingyang Princess, and toppling numerous court officials as a result; later dispatched to Yunzhou, where he stood alone against the rebel forces when the diplomatic envoy was imperiled…

Upon his return to the capital, he first solved the Palace Concubine Fu case, then bested the Buddhists, winning the grand contest—a man whose life was a string of legends.

Many male disciples recalled that during that period, their senior and junior sisters in the manor frequently discussed this man in private, claiming that out of the countless young heroes in the jianghu, none could compare to a single finger of Xu Qi’an.

And that wasn’t all. Just over half a month ago, an imperial self-reproach edict was posted in Jianzhou City, shaking the entire jianghu.

The man on the dragon throne, after reigning for thirty-seven years, had issued his first self-reproach edict, its contents shocking beyond words.

When the disciples of Yue Clan Manor inquired further, they learned that the capital had been embroiled in a massive case—King Huai’s massacre of an entire city, the emperor’s complicity, and the entire court’s officials choosing to remain silent, bowing to imperial authority rather than seeking justice for the 380,000 innocent lives lost.

It was Xu Qi’an!

Storming the imperial palace, capturing National Dukes, denouncing the court in the execution ground—one blade cutting through the darkness and revealing the light of justice, yet severing his own future in the process.

Every single female disciple in Yue Clan Manor admired that legendary Silver Gong.

Never in their wildest dreams did they expect that the very man they had long revered was not only a holder of an Earth Book fragment but also a member of Heaven and Earth Society—one of their own…

This realization was more inspiring than any grand speech.

The young female disciples, overwhelmed with excitement, blushed deeply, their eyes sparkling as if they might scream and rush forward at any moment.

Li Miaozhen, keeping a composed expression, swept her gaze across the young Daoist nuns, noting the admiration and fervor in their eyes. She frowned slightly, displeased.

Her discontent, of course, stemmed from not wanting to see the female disciples of the Earth Sect fall into the pit that was Xu Qi’an. The man was a notorious womaniser, far from an upstanding gentleman. What else could it be?

"Ahem!"

Daoist Jinlian materialized like a ghost, standing beside the orange cat, stroking his beard with a smile that did not extend to his eyes.

"Sir Xu, please do not jest. How could this poor daoist possibly be a cat?"

*Damn, Daoist, your expression is kind of scary…* Xu Qi’an tactfully changed the subject. "Daoist, we’ve arrived. How much longer until the lotus seeds mature?"

He then surveyed the surroundings and asked, "Did you summon us here via the Earth Book because of this situation?"

Daoist Jinlian nodded, glancing at the scene of devastation with a helpless sigh.

"Your emperor of the Great Feng is quite interested in the Nine-Coloured Lotus as well. Not only did he send a group of mysterious experts, but they also brought enchanted cannons. They bombarded the manor at dawn, destroying the formations I had set up."

He sighed again. "Originally, I planned for you all to cooperate with my formations to defend the manor and maximize our advantage, making it possible to triumph despite being outnumbered. But now…"

Before Xu Qi’an and the others could respond, a voice suddenly echoed through the ruins.

"You call such a crude thing a formation?"

The voice was laced with undisguised disdain and scorn.

The disciples of Heaven and Earth Society were instantly enraged, scanning their surroundings and shouting, "Who dares speak in such a cowardly manner, hiding in the shadows?"

"Ahh…"

A deep, ethereal sigh resonated from all directions, omnipresent.

"If heaven birthed not I, Yang Qianhuan, then the Great Feng will be a night that never ends…"

This voice seemed to come from an ancient era, carrying the weight of endless years and profound history, echoing in the ears of all present.

"D-Dare I ask, who is the esteemed senior?"

If heaven birthed not I, Yang Qianhuan, then the Great Feng will be a night that never ends… What domineering words, what unparalleled arrogance. The elegant and beautiful Daoist Bailian was taken aback. Besides the Earth Book holders, had Daoist Jinlian also invited an unparalleled expert?

The gathered disciples, too, restrained their artifacts, glancing around uneasily in search of the mysterious "senior." Even Senior Uncle Bailian had addressed him with respect—how could they dare to offend him with rash words?

"There…!" A female disciple noticed him and whispered.

In the distance stood a figure in white, his back turned to them. Hands clasped behind him, his robe billowed in the wind, strands of hair fluttering—his presence ethereal, like an exiled immortal.

"This is the renowned arcanist of the capital, Yang Qianhuan—Senior Yang." Xu Qi’an quickly introduced.

Daoist Bailian stepped forward and respectfully saluted. "Many thanks for coming to our aid, Senior Yang. Did you become acquainted with Senior Brother Jinlian in the capital?"

As she spoke, Daoist Bailian cast a glance at Daoist Jinlian.

So, Daoist Leader Jinlian had managed to establish a connection with the Sitianjian? The arcanists of Sitianjian, after Confucianism, were the most arrogant group, looking down on even the Daoist sects.

As expected of the Daoist Leader—his scheming had unknowingly reached such depths.

The disciples’ faces lit up with joy.

Yang Qianhuan snorted. "Who is Jinlian?"

*Uh…* Daoist Bailian was momentarily stunned. "You don’t know Senior Brother Jinlian?"

Yang Qianhuan stood with hands behind his back, his tone indifferent. "Why should I know him?"

Bailian asked curiously, "Then why have you come?"

The disciples, too, fixated their gazes on Yang Qianhuan’s back.

Yang Qianhuan replied coolly, "Were it not for Xu Qi’an’s request, I would not bother with such trivial affairs."

*Enough, enough, Senior Yang, you’re laying it on too thick…* Xu Qi’an silently facepalmed.

*So it was Sir Xu who invited him? That made sense—after all, he had represented the Sitianjian in the Buddhist duel. He must have a connection with them…* Daoist Bailian turned to Xu Qi’an and solemnly bowed, her voice gentle.

"Sir Xu’s chivalrous reputation is well-earned. The Heaven and Earth Society will never forget this great kindness."

The disciples also realized that the white-clad senior was someone Xu Qi’an had invited. Instantly, their gazes toward Xu Qi’an became even more filled with gratitude and recognition.

The female disciples’ eyes sparkled. They felt that Young Master Xu perfectly matched the heroic figure they had imagined—no discrepancies at all.

Their admiration for him only deepened.

*Senior Yang, please maintain this level of pretentiousness…* Xu Qi’an seized the moment. "Senior Yang, why not demonstrate your skills and repair or improve the formations protecting Yue Clan Manor?"

At once, all eyes, including those of Jinlian, Bailian, and the entire Heaven and Earth Society, turned expectantly to Yang Qianhuan.

…Yang Qianhuan realized he had been placed on a pedestal and had no way to step down. If he refused, his carefully crafted image as a reclusive master would be shattered.

"Fine…" He responded succinctly, then added, "Everyone, leave this place. Do not approach."

The graceful Daoist Bailian smiled. "Of course. We would not dare to intrude upon Senior Yang’s secret techniques."

*He just doesn’t want them to see his face while working on the formations…* Xu Qi’an mentally ridiculed.

…

Deep within the manor, by the cold pond.

"This is the Nine-Coloured Lotus?"

Lina's eyes reflected the shimmering multicoloured glow as she sighed in admiration. "It's so beautiful."

Li Miaozhen pressed her lips together, sharing the same yearning that was unique to women. Since ancient times, women had always had a weakness for flowers—especially beautiful ones.

"It has indeed reached maturity," Xu Qi’an commented.

He couldn't help but think of the princess consort kept in that secluded courtyard—the reincarnation of the Flower God from nine hundred years ago. If she were here, she would surely be breathtaking beyond words.

Chu Yuanzhen and Hengyuan remained calm. The former was devoted only to his sword, while the latter had a heart unshaken by worldly distractions.

Daoist Jinlian said, "This morning’s bombardment was merely a probe. They, too, fear destroying the lotus seeds at this crucial moment. Heh, by tomorrow at dusk, the lotus seeds will fully mature. I estimate that today will be when they shed all pretenses and launch a full-scale attack on the manor."

"Tell us about the enemy," Li Miaozhen said as she sat cross-legged by the pond. "Know yourself and your enemy, and you will always be victorious."

Daoist Jinlian pondered for a moment before nodding. "Three factions have their eyes on the Nine-Coloured Lotus. First are the Earth Sect’s demon daoists. I won’t even mention Daoist Leader Heilian’s avatar. Aside from him, the Earth Sect has nine elders, each named after a color—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Azure, Blue, Purple, Gold, and White."

He turned to the middle-aged Daoist nun with fair skin and a round face, introducing her. "This is Elder Bailian, White Lotus."

Daoist Bailian, exuding the mature charm of an experienced woman, smiled and gave a Daoist salute.

Daoist Jinlian continued, "I am Elder Jinlian, Gold Lotus. As for the others, Purple Lotus Elder Zilian perished at the hands of Yang Yan. Yang Yan was a peak Rank Four and a martial artist, so it wasn’t an unfair defeat.

"However, Purple Lotus was the weakest of the elders. Red, Orange, and Yellow are all peak Rank Four experts. Green, Azure, and Blue are slightly weaker, but still far stronger than ordinary Rank Four experts."

Li Miaozhen muttered, "I’m at the bottom of Rank Four…"

She had only stepped into Rank Four three or four months ago. Her foundation was still shallow, far from comparable to veteran or peak Rank Four experts.

Lina frowned, her deep blue eyes flashing with confusion. She counted on her fingers before suddenly realizing something. "Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Azure, Blue, Purple, Gold, White… Daoist Jinlian, aren't you and Daoist Bailian actually at the bottom?"

Daoist Bailian paused, glancing at Daoist Jinlian as if to say: _What’s with this girl? Calling us out right to our faces?_

Daoist Jinlian slightly shook his head: _You’re overthinking it._

"Ahem!"

Clearing his throat, he redirected the conversation. "The Wulin Alliance has gathered its affiliated sects and factions. Most of the sect leaders and masters are Fourth Rank, varying in strength. I haven’t had much contact with them, so I can’t gauge their exact power.

"But the real threat is the Wulin Alliance’s leader, Cao Qingyang. He is number three on the martial league. Rumor has it that he has already stepped one foot into Rank Three. In the past few centuries, he has been the one in the Great Feng jianghu with the most promise of reaching third rank.”

Chu Yuanzhen mused, "How strong is he exactly?"

A mere claim of ‘one foot into Rank Three’ was too vague to determine his actual combat strength.

Daoist Jinlian analysed, "Even two Yang Yans wouldn’t be able to defeat him."

*So, it would take three Yang Yans to match or barely overpower him…* Chu Yuanzhen’s expression grew heavy.

_Since when did my former superior become a unit of combat measurement…?_ Xu Qi’an thought to himself, using humor to ease the tension.

"How many troops has the imperial court sent?" Li Miaozhen asked.

"Not troops, but a group of mysterious experts. They wear black robes and masks—around twenty of them. They also brought enchanted cannons and are currently stationed in a small town ten miles away," Daoist Jinlian explained.

"the Zhenbei King’s covert agents?!"

_So the remnants of the Zhenbei King’s forces have been absorbed by Emperor Yuanjing…_ Xu Qi’an and Li Miaozhen exchanged glances.

"So they are the Zhenbei King’s spies," Daoist Jinlian muttered in realization.

The enemy had too many experts. Even disregarding the others, just the sheer number of Rank Four martial artists was overwhelming. Even Lina, normally carefree, felt the growing pressure.

Xu Qi’an stood at the edge of the pond, his gaze locked onto the Nine-Coloured Lotus. He suddenly asked,

"Daoist, this lotus must be incredibly important to you—important enough that, no matter the cost, you must protect it."

Li Miaozhen and the others froze, turning their gazes toward him. Chu Yuanzhen was the first to grasp the deeper meaning behind his words. Li Miaozhen followed, then Hengyuan.

Lina… did not pass the intelligence check.

_I remember Daoist Jinlian once mentioned that he was gravely injured while stealing the Nine-Coloured Lotus from the Daoist Leader after he succumbed to demonic corruption. The lotus must have far greater significance than I initially thought; otherwise, Daoist Jinlian wouldn’t have risked his life to steal it…_ Chu Yuanzhen recalled this crucial detail.

*Though the Nine-Coloured Lotus is a rare treasure, under such dire circumstances, the rational choice would have been to abandon it and preserve their strength. Yet, Daoist Jinlian is determined to fight head-on…* Li Miaozhen glanced at Xu Qi’an. _As expected of you!_

Hengyuan shared the same thoughts.

"Indeed, the Nine-Coloured Lotus is crucial. It is the key to cleansing my sect of its corruption and cannot be lost," Daoist Jinlian admitted, though he did not elaborate further.

_Daoist, my quote is going up…_ Xu Qi’an barely held back from blurting it out.

At that moment, a disciple rushed over, shouting anxiously, "Daoist! A group of jianghu cultivators has taken advantage of the broken formations and invaded! There are a lot of them!"

Daoist Jinlian turned to Xu Qi’an and Li Miaozhen. "I’ll have to trouble you two with this matter."
