# 403. To the death

_"Boom!"_

_"Crack..."_

The moment the people inside the room vanished, several figures burst through the windows and walls.

They included two black-robed figures wearing golden masks and three middle-aged Daoists, each with a different-colored lotus embroidered on their chests—blue, green, and azure.

The black-robed man wearing a golden mask, a heaven-class spy codenamed Tianji — “Heaven’s Secrets”, scanned the empty room and said grimly, "It must have been teleportation. We didn’t even notice his disguise."

They had been monitoring everyone entering the inn from nearby. With their level of perception, they should have been able to see through disguises like human-skin masks even from a distance.

The other golden-masked black-robed figure spoke, her voice cold and sharp. "Yang Qianhuan was here too?"

"Hmm," Tianji nodded. "Xu Qi’an has always had a good relationship with the Arcanists of the Sitianjian. This isn’t surprising."

The female spy scoffed. "He wants to divide us and take us down one by one?"

The Earth Sect’s Daoist Qinglian let out a mocking laugh. "Idiotic."

The female spy, codenamed Tianshu — “Heaven’s axle”, gave him a sidelong glance and said, "A fourth rank Arcanist’s teleportation has a maximum range of about thirty miles—not too far. The only uncertainty is which direction they teleported to."

Tianji pondered for a moment before saying, "We can’t wait any longer. We’ll split up and track them. Hm… Teleportation can be interrupted. He must have caught us off guard this time, but with those two powerful attendants of his, they won’t be able to do it again. Don’t chase too far—if you don’t sense any fluctuations in qi, it means you’ve gone the wrong way. Turn back immediately."

At that moment, outside the inn, multiple factions had arrived—Earth Sect disciples in feathered Daoist robes, scattered jianghu warriors who had secretly allied together, King Huai’s spies, and members of the Wulin Alliance who had been drawn in by the commotion.

Over a hundred people had gathered outside the inn, flooding the streets and alleyways.

This was a premeditated ambush. After the alliance was formed in Three Immortals Inn during the day, the white-robed young master had revealed his plan.

The spies and Earth Sect Daoists had believed it was worth attempting. And sure enough, their prey had walked into the trap.

What they hadn’t accounted for was that Yue Clan Manor had a fourth rank Arcanist hidden among them.

The five Rank Four experts rushed out of the inn. Tianji swept his gaze across the crowd and said, "I’ll take the west. The rest of you—"

He suddenly fell silent and turned toward the street ahead. Heavy footsteps echoed through the air, each step causing a faint tremor in the ground.

All eyes turned in that direction. A young girl was charging toward them, holding — holding aloft a cannon?

"Heeeyah!"

She used her running momentum to hurl the cannon with all her might.

The steel monster spun through the air, cutting through the wind as it hurtled toward the crowd.

Instinctively, everyone scattered, ducking and diving out of the way.

Tianji strode forward, tearing off his cloak. With a flick of his wrist, waves of qi surged out like a tide, striking the cannon repeatedly, neutralising its momentum.

He reached out and caught the cannon, then casually tossed it aside. It landed with a resounding “boom”.

"You go ahead—I’ll deal with this Strength Gu Tribe brat." Tianji snorted.

"This little girl is quite the beauty. Don’t kill her—leave her for me to play with," Daoist Lanlian sneered lecherously.

Tianji frowned slightly, displeased by the Earth Sect’s constant malice, and said indifferently, "I don’t go easy on my enemies."

Daoist Lanlian scoffed and led his disciples toward the main street.

"Amitabha!"

A burly monk blocked their path.

At the same time, two sword lights streaked through the air—Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen descended on their flying swords, intercepting the remaining three Rank Fours.

"So it really was a setup. I underestimated you," Tianji said coldly.

"Enough talk. Last time in Chuzhou, you got away too quickly," Li Miaozhen snapped.

The female spy Tianshu narrowed her eyes and said icily, "Li Miaozhen, we were just looking for you to settle accounts."

Then she smirked. "Did you think this was all we had prepared?"

Chu Yuanzhen smiled faintly. "The same words apply to you."

…

The town was teeming with experts, especially around the inn, which had long been completely occupied by jianghu warriors.

The moment battle erupted, the warriors in the inn fled, while those staying farther away—along with other sects of the Wulin Alliance—rushed to the scene.

"What’s going on?" Miss Rongrong pushed open the door of her room and found the elders already gathered in the courtyard.

On the rooftop, Tower Master Xiao Yuenu stood, gazing toward the inn.

"A fight broke out at the inn. Judging by the fluctuations in qi, it’s fourth rank level," she replied.

Snapping out of her thoughts, she looked down at her disciples and said solemnly, "Evacuate the townspeople immediately. If they resist, use force."

"Yes Ma’am!"

The disciples and elders of Wanhua Tower responded in unison.

"Tower Master, who’s involved in the conflict?" Rongrong asked crisply.

Then, she noticed Xiao Yuenu’s expression shift into something complicated.

"Xu Qi’an has launched an attack," she said slowly.

"What?!"

Gasps filled the courtyard.

_That’s exactly his style…_ Rongrong’s head snapped toward the inn in disbelief.

…

Outside the town, three figures skimmed low over the ground on flying swords.

They wore matching Daoist robes, each embroidered with a lotus of a different color—one with a red lotus, one with an orange lotus, and one with a yellow lotus.

The Red Lotus Honglian and Orange Lotus Chenglian Daoists had graying hair, clearly advanced in age. The Yellow Lotus Daoist Huanglian, in contrast, was middle-aged, visibly younger than his two companions.

"There’s a qi fluctuation to the south…"

Huanglian sensed for a moment before adjusting his flying sword and taking the lead.

Apart from their Daoist Leader, who was always on high alert after the mysterious powerhouse appeared in Chu Prefecture, all the Earth Sect's Lotus Daoists had gathered in the town.

Li Miaozhen and the others had intercepted several Rank Fours at the inn, but they couldn’t stop everyone.

The three Lotus Daoists had been positioned as the “reserve force”, prepared for any unforeseen circumstances. Now, the time had come for them to act.

Though the Lotus Daoists had embraced the path of demonic cultivation, often struggling to control their own wicked desires, their brains didn’t rot along with them.

"Heh, what an utterly brainless brute. Just killing one of his men was enough to send him storming into our trap." Chenglian sneered, his malicious expression brimming with disdain.

"Martial artists are just martial artists—so crude it's almost pitiful."

"Jinlian’s greatest mistake was inviting a mere martial artist to assist him," Honglian said indifferently. "Of all the great factions, only our Earth Sect’s demonic path is eternal."

If they could kill even a few of the younger elites, or at least severely injure them, then tomorrow, Jinlian wouldn’t be able to protect the lotus seeds.

Even if Jinlian, in desperation, chose to destroy the lotus seeds, that would be regrettable. But ultimately, the greatest loss would still be his own.

Soon, the three Daoists spotted the battlefield.

It was a middle-aged swordsman with a neatly trimmed beard, and a burly man with an iron gauntlet, his muscular chest bare.

The moment they noticed the three Lotus Daoists, the two men stopped fighting in perfect sync. Then, they grinned.

"We've been waiting for you."

The faces of the three Daoists stiffened in unison.

…

Thirty li outside the town, atop a gently sloping hill, five figures appeared simultaneously.

Qiu Qian glanced around in alarm, scanning the area. Once he confirmed their surroundings, he let out a relieved sigh and chuckled.

"Honestly, I thought you’d teleport us straight into Yue Clan Manor. That would’ve been truly dangerous. You caught me off guard this time, but you won’t be able to teleport us again. Should I call you smart or stupid?"

Suddenly, he burst into laughter, his shoulders shaking with arrogance. "I think you’re quite smart—you knew how to curry favor with me by delivering yourself right to your death."

Xu Qi’an slowly drew his black-gold sabre. "To kill a mere fish like you, Senior Brother Yang and I are more than enough."

Li Miaozhen and the others were still occupied in town. Sending them to the manor was meaningless.

First, the Nine-Colored Lotus couldn’t withstand intense qi fluctuations. Despite being a supreme treasure, its power did not lie in defensive capabilities.

Second, the white-robed young master’s two attendants were exceptionally strong. If they fought in the manor, it would inevitably involve the Heaven and Earth Society disciples—though they would have to fight sooner or later anyway.

Lastly, Yang Qianhuan had laid down multiple layers of defensive formations. It was like defending a fortress—if the enemy wanted to climb the walls, they’d have to pay in blood.

_Why would we willingly put the enemy on top of the wall?_

Yang Qianhuan let out a disdainful "Heh" and shook his head. "I will not sully my hands. A lowly insect like him is unworthy of my efforts."

Qiu Qian’s brow twitched. A surge of fury rose within him—he loathed this white-robed Arcanist’s tone and arrogance.

"If your goal was to make me angry, you’ve succeeded," Qiu Qian sneered.

"Who asked?" Yang Qianhuan replied flatly.

"You don’t even dare to show your real face. Afraid of my revenge?" Qiu Qian fixed his gaze on the back of Yang Qianhuan’s head.

Yang Qianhuan merely let out another "Heh."

"……" Qiu Qian’s face twitched. He growled, "Left Guardian, Right Guardian—kill him."

The silent Right Guardian vanished, and reappeared right behind Yang Qianhuan. He threw a devastating punch.

His fist pierced through Yang Qianhuan’s body—but struck nothing but an afterimage.

The white-robed Arcanist had reappeared in the distance, his tone as irritating as ever.

"A crude martial artist. Dealing with you is like toying with foolish rats. No, not even rats—at least a cornered rat will bite. You’re nothing but insects."

"Kill him!" Qiu Qian roared.

_Yang Qianhuan really knows how to provoke people…_ Even Xu Qi’an found his words grating.

*I didn’t even see him bend his knees to gather force—he just appeared behind Yang Qianhuan instantly. That’s the wonder of fifth rank Transforming Force—perfect control over the body’s strength. I never understood before why Yang Yan and the others always seemed to flicker in and out of sight when they fought. Now I do.*

Yang Qianhuan leisurely pulled a metal box from his robes, opened it, and a battallion of cannons and ballistae appeared beside him, forming a defensive circle around him.

At the same time, dozens of muskets appeared, floating in the air.

Each piece of weaponry was inscribed with formations, their power at least ten times greater than ordinary firearms.

An array formation emerged beneath Yang Qianhuan’s feet, linking him to the floating weapons.

Now, they moved with him—teleporting whenever he did.

"You crude martial artists. Let me show you the greatness and terror of an Arcanist."

He snapped his fingers.

The ballistae, cannon muzzles, and rifle barrels all aligned directly at the cloaked Right Guardian.

_"Boom! Boom! Boom!"_

_"Bang! Bang! Bang!"_

_"Crack! Crack! Crack!"_

A barrage of fire erupted.

Even with a Bronze Skin and Iron Bones physique, the Right Guardian dared not take on such an overwhelming barrage of firepower. Using his explosive speed as a martial artist, he zigzagged around Yang Qianhuan, trying to find an opening for a side attack.

But Yang Qianhuan, with his mastery of teleportation, was even faster. He always adjusted his position in advance, realigning his cannons and ballistae, forcing the Right Guardian to abandon each charge and keep circling.

Arrows embedded into the ground, cannon blasts tore the earth apart, sending dirt and debris flying, while explosions of fire and thunder shook the battlefield.

Yang Qianhuan’s metal box was like an endless arsenal, continuously replenishing ammunition and bolts.

Then, just as the Right Guardian seemed cornered, he suddenly disappeared, only to reappear right behind Yang Qianhuan, a mere three feet away.

For a peak Rank Four martial artist, this distance was enough to heavily wound, or even kill, someone of the same rank from another system.

It should have been effortless.

But all he struck was an afterimage.

_That was close—almost flipped the boat…_ Yang Qianhuan reappeared dozens of meters away, a thin layer of cold sweat forming on his back, though his expression remained completely composed.

"You’re using a teleportation artifact against me? You’re trying to fight an Arcanist using Arcanist techniques? Should I call you clever or stupid? No, I think you’re quite clever—because you’ve successfully given me the pleasure of crushing you with superior intelligence."

_Senior Brother Yang is actually quite capable as an Arcanist. I was worried for nothing—he's completely in control..._ Xu Qi’an slowly nodded, feeling reassured.

He was infected by Yang Qianhuan’s unwavering confidence.

No longer paying attention to Yang Qianhuan’s battle, he hefted his sabre and walked toward Qiu Qian and the Left Guardian. "Now, it’s our turn."

Qiu Qian smirked and stepped forward. "Left Guardian, hold the line for me. I’ll deal with this little bastard myself."

The Left Guardian frowned, habitually advising, "Young Master, your life is invaluable. You should not take such risks. The safest approach is for us to kill him together.

"In a fight to the death, there’s no need for bravado."

Xu Qi’an nodded. "Come at me together. Otherwise, with just you, little insect, I can take on ten of you."

His tone was calm, his expression indifferent, as if stating an irrefutable fact.

Qiu Qian sneered. "I’ve practiced martial arts tirelessly since childhood. I’ve never slacked off, and I consider myself unmatched among my peers. In the Great Feng, people sing praises of you, Xu Qi’an, calling you a genius on par with the Zhenbei King.

"But I know that you only got to where you are because of that thing’s blessing and a series of lucky encounters. In truth, you’re nothing."

He strode forward, extending his right palm.

The Left Guardian quickly opened a black wooden case, from which a small sword flew out, rapidly expanding into a long sword as clear as autumn waters.

The blade was so transparent it seemed to absorb the moonlight, its edge and spine coated in a faint, water-like glow.

_So he does know about my fortune, and he resents it deeply…_ Xu Qi’an’s blood boiled. He couldn’t wait to cut this man down and summon his soul for answers.

Both figures vanished at the same time.

The difference was that where Xu Qi’an had stood, the ground suddenly cracked under two deep footprints, while Qiu Qian left no trace at all.

_"Clang!"_

Sparks erupted in midair.

Their figures appeared only after the clash—blade and sword pressing against each other.

"Your sabre was forged by the Jianzheng himself, but my Moonshadow is no less powerful," Qiu Qian sneered.

Then, he suddenly exerted force, pushing Xu Qi’an backward. The moment the pressure lifted, his sword erupted into motion.

Dozens of sword slashes flashed at the same time, aiming at Xu Qi’an’s chest, limbs, and throat—

A cascade of dazzling sparks burst forth.

_Fifth rank?_

Xu Qi’an furrowed his brows as he felt faint stinging pain where the sword had struck.

It confirmed that his opponent’s weapon was indeed no lesser than his own Black Gold sabre.

"I told you—without that fortune blessing you, you’re nothing but trash. Today, I will break you, sever your limbs, and turn you into a human stick. Not just that—I will take everything from you."

As he uttered the last words, Qiu Qian’s afterimage dissolved, his real body appearing at Xu Qi’an’s side in the middle of a perfect execution strike.

The instinctive danger sense of a martial artist kicked in, giving Xu Qi’an a premonition of the incoming attack. He reacted instantly, bringing his Black Gold sabre to block.

_"Clang!"_

More sparks flew as their weapons collided again—but this time, Qiu Qian’s expression suddenly stiffened, his pupils briefly dilating in confusion.

The Heart Sword!

The earlier strike had been just a test—Qiu Qian was not fourth rank and had not grasped “Intent”. This meant Xu Qi’an’s Heart Sword could effectively shake his primordial spirit.

Seizing the moment, Xu Qi’an followed up with a deafening Lion’s Roar, sending another shockwave through Qiu Qian’s spirit.

At the same time, he gathered all his qi and slashed at Qiu Qian’s head.

There was no time to unleash the one blade from heaven and earth—he had to kill this arrogant bastard before his guardian could react.
