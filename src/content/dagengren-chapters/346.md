# 346. Conversation in the Night

The deck descended into an eerie silence.

The officials of the three judicial departments and the guards were as quiet as cicadas in winter, not daring to provoke Xu Qi’an. Especially the constable from the Ministry of Law, who had just accused Xu Qi’an of harbouring delusions of autocracy.

Now, his cheeks burned with embarrassment. He finally understood the anger and helplessness of the Minister of Law toward this audacious child. He hated Xu Qi’an to the bone but could do nothing about him.

Of course, the one who suffered the greatest humiliation was Chu Xianglong. As the deputy general of the Zhenbei King, he wielded real power on the borderlands. Even in the capital, he rarely had to defer to others.

Not even the most powerful officials of the court intimidated him. After all, his life and career were controlled by the Zhenbei King, and no one else could truly deal with him. Over time, this nurtured his arrogance and brazenness—until now, when he was utterly defeated under Xu Qi’an’s command.

While struggling to suppress his resentment and anger, Chu Xianglong tried to convince himself to focus on the bigger picture. But he no longer had the face to remain on deck. After casting a deep, resentful look at Xu Qi’an, he left without a word.

He could feel the mocking gazes of the others boring into him, making it impossible to stay any longer.

Both on the deck and within the ship, the gazes directed at Xu Qi’an subtly shifted. Where once there had been scrutiny and a sense of watching the drama unfold, there was now respect and awe.

The position of a Silver Gong wasn’t particularly high; there were many in the envoy whose official ranks surpassed his. However, the authority Xu Qi’an wielded and the imperial decree he carried as the principal investigator made him unquestionably deserving of his role as lead official.

Anyone tempted to feign compliance or leverage their rank would now think twice, Chu Xianglong’s humiliation serving as a cautionary tale.

The princess consort remained blocked by her maids and couldn’t see the expressions on everyone’s faces. However, the change in tone was enough for her to grasp the situation.

At first glance, his actions seemed domineering and rash, giving the impression of youthful impulsiveness. But in truth, they were well-calculated. He had anticipated the Imperial Guards' support. No, that wasn’t right—she had been misled by appearances. Xu Qi’an’s ability to suppress Chu Xianglong stemmed from acting in a manner aligned with justice. Thus, he could stand tall and act with dignity. As the saying goes, "Those who gain the Way have many allies; those who lose it have few."

The consort had to admit that this was a man of great charisma and decisiveness, albeit one who was far too lecherous.

With Chu Xianglong’s capitulation and retreat, the commotion came to an end.

Silver Gong Xu reassured the guards before heading toward the cabin. The maids blocking the entrance immediately stepped aside, their gazes tinged with apprehension.

As he passed the elderly maid, Xu Qi’an winked at her. She responded with a look of disdain, turning her face away with visible contempt.

*Truly a lecher...* the princess consort thought to herself.

In her current appearance, she was far from beautiful, her features plain and unremarkable. Yet even so, this shameless and licentious Xu Qi’an had the audacity to flirt.

Entering the cabin, Xu Qi’an ascended to the second floor and knocked on Yang Yan’s door.

“Come in,” came the calm reply from Yang Yan, who had refrained from participating in the dispute from the beginning.

Xu Qi’an pushed the door open to find Yang Yan sitting cross-legged on the bed, with two pairs of boots neatly arranged at its foot.

Yang Yan’s meticulousness was evident, though it was distinct from the OCD of Brother Chun.

Closing the door, Xu Qi’an walked over to the table, poured himself a cup of water, and drained it in one gulp before speaking in a low voice. “What’s the story with those women?”

“Chu Xianglong is escorting the princess consort to the Northern Territories. To avoid drawing attention, they’ve blended into the envoy. His Majesty and Duke Wei were informed, but it was only a verbal acknowledgment—there’s no formal documentation,” Yang Yan explained.

*So it really is the consort...* Xu Qi’an frowned. His suspicions were correct; the woman Chu Xianglong was protecting was indeed the Zhenbei King’s consort. That was precisely why he had only intimidated Chu Xianglong rather than truly expelling him.

“Why would the consort’s journey to the Northern Territories require such secrecy?” Xu Qi’an asked.

Yang Yan shook his head.

*There’s definitely something suspicious here...* Xu Qi’an lowered his voice. “Boss, tell me about this princess consort. She seems mysterious.”

Yang Yan frowned slightly. This question clearly posed a challenge for him. For someone who saw the pursuit of martial prowess as life’s ultimate goal, gossip held no appeal whatsoever.

“I don’t know much. I only know that after the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the consort was bestowed upon the Zhenbei King by His Majesty. For the next twenty years, she never left the capital.”

*I already know that, and I even remember the poem describing her...* Xu Qi’an realized he wouldn’t be getting any juicy details and felt a pang of disappointment.

“You’ve offended Chu Xianglong this time. Once we reach the Northern Territories, you can expect him to make things difficult for you. On the bright side, you’ve firmly established your authority. No one will dare challenge you for the rest of the journey,” Yang Yan continued. “As for the officials from the three judicial departments, they can’t be trusted. They lack enthusiasm for the case.”

*That’s obvious. Without personal risk, they’ll investigate; but at the first sign of danger, they’ll shrink back. After all, failure in their duties only leads to punishment, which is preferable to losing their lives...* Xu Qi’an nodded. “I understand. That’s just human nature.”

Yang Yan offered no further advice. He nodded, then looked at Xu Qi’an. “Anything else? If not, leave. Don’t disturb my cultivation.”

*Boss, you’re no fun at all. You’re like those code monkeys from my previous life who, when faced with a woman undressing, would shout: ‘404!’*

Half-joking and half-lampooning, Xu Qi’an left the room.

…

That evening, after supper, beneath the azure night sky, Xu Qi’an sat on the deck chatting with Chen Xiao and a group of Imperial Guards, spinning tales and exchanging banter.

Xu Qi’an regaled them with stories of how he had solved the tax silver case, the Sangpo case, the Pingyang Princess affair, and more. The guards listened in awe, genuinely impressed, regarding Xu Qi’an as nothing short of a legend.

As members of the Imperial Guard stationed in the capital, they had often heard of these cases but knew none of the details. Now, they were finally learning how Silver Gong Xu had unraveled them.

For instance, in the tax silver case, Xu Ningyan—then just a constable of Changle County—had remained calm even when thrown into turmoil. He had addressed the prefect with poise:

“Do you wish to solve the case?”

The prefect replied, “Of course.”

Xu Ningyan had said simply, “Bring me the files.”

The files were presented, and after just one glance, he had deciphered the puzzle that had stymied the Nightwatchers and the prefecture officials alike.

Or take the Sangpo case—a tangled and storied affair destined to be etched in history. Neither the Ministry of Law nor the constables of the prefecture had been able to make headway, lost in confusion. Yet Xu Qi’an—then only a Bronze Gong—had boldly declared with his imperial token in hand:

“What the Ministry of Law cannot solve, I, Xu Qi’an, shall handle. What they dare not do, I shall undertake.”

The incompetents of the Ministry of Law had been so shamed they could only bow their heads.

*Silver Gong Xu is incredible…* The guards’ admiration for him grew ever deeper.

Xu Qi’an took a swig from his flask and, with a sweeping glance at the lean faces before him, said proudly, “But all that pales in comparison to my greatest achievement—the Yunzhou case.”

He leaned forward, voice imbued with gravitas. “That day, the rebel army of Yunzhou stormed the Provincial Administration Office. The Governor and his colleagues were on the verge of death. Alone, with just my blade, I stood before eight thousand rebels. Not one passed me.

“I fought for an hour straight, broke dozens of blades, and was riddled with arrows, but still, not a single rebel breached the gates.”

“Eight thousand?” Chen Xiao, a centurion, paused, scratching his head. “I heard it was ten thousand.”

“I heard fifteen thousand.”

“No, no,” another soldier chimed in. “My brother in the guards said it was twenty thousand!”

The soldiers began to debate the numbers.

*Uh… this exaggeration is getting out of hand…* Xu Qi’an coughed, drawing their attention. “No, no, those are just rumours. The real number was eight thousand.”

Eight thousand felt like a reasonable figure to Xu Qi’an; anything more would be excessive. Even he sometimes wondered how many rebels he had truly faced that day.

“Ah, so it was eight thousand rebels.”

The guards nodded in unison, firmly convinced of this “truth”—after all, it had come straight from Silver Gong Xu himself.

As the conversation wound down, it was time for the guards to stretch their legs. Xu Qi’an clapped his hands and said, “Tomorrow we’ll reach Jianzhou. From there, it’s just a short journey north to the Jianzhou border. We’ll rest a day at the Jianzhou waystation to replenish supplies. I’ll give you half a day’s leave tomorrow.”

*Sir Xu is so generous…* The soldiers beamed as they filed below deck.

The once lively deck quickly grew quiet, taking on a chill beneath the frost-like moonlight. Its glow touched the ship, the river, and the faces of the few who remained.

“Liar!”

Xu Qi’an, flask still in hand, turned to see someone beside him hurling the accusation.

He smirked shamelessly. “You’re just jealous of my excellence. How do you know I’m lying? You weren’t in Yunzhou.”

The old auntie snorted, sharp-tongued as ever. “How do you know I was talking about Yunzhou?”

Xu Qi’an was momentarily at a loss, then grumbled, “Do you have anything better to do? If not, scram.”

She snapped back, “I won’t. It’s not your ship.”

Having been seasick these past days, her complexion was pallid, with dark circles under her eyes—a far cry from her usual poise. She had taken to coming up for fresh air at night, often overhearing Xu Qi’an and the guards chatting and only daring to step out after they dispersed.

Xu Qi’an ignored her, and she ignored him. One gazed at the shimmering river, the other at the bright moon above.

When silent, there was a quiet beauty to her, like a crabapple flower blooming alone under moonlight. The light softened her plain features, while shadows from her lashes deepened her gaze, making it as vast as the sea or as pure as a polished onyx.

Xu Qi’an took another sip of wine and shifted his gaze from her to the heavens. He sighed and declared, “I’m struck by poetic inspiration. Consider yourself fortunate—I’ll grace you with a verse. You can use it to dazzle others in the future.”

She scoffed, feigning disdain, though her ears perked up.

As much as she wanted to mock this aggravating man, she couldn’t bring herself to disparage his poetry, renowned throughout the capital’s literary circles. Any comment would only make her appear foolish.

She waited patiently, but when no poem came, she turned her head to see him watching her with a teasing glint in his eyes. She huffed in anger and quickly looked away.

Finally, his voice drifted to her ears, half sigh, half recitation:

“Today’s people cannot see the ancient moon, yet today’s moon shone on ancient people.”

*Today’s people cannot see the ancient moon, yet today’s moon shone on ancient people…* She blinked, her eyes widening as she repeated the lines under her breath, the words resonating within her. A spark of admiration lit her face.

“I finally understand why the scholars in the capital are so enamoured with your poetry,” she murmured.

*They don’t admire me—I don’t create poetry; I just regurgitate it…* Xu Qi’an smiled and replied, “You flatter me. Poetry is innate. I’ve always felt my mind brimming with immortal verses, ready to flow at a moment’s notice.”

This time, the prickly woman didn’t argue or retort. Instead, she pressed, “What’s the next line?”

*I don’t remember the rest…* Xu Qi’an spread his hands. “That’s all there is. No more.”

She ground her teeth. “I finally understand why so many people can’t stand you.”

Once again, silence reigned.

The old auntie leaned against the railing, gazing at the gently rippling river. This posture inevitably caused her hips to lift slightly, and beneath her thin spring clothing, the round contours of her figure were distinctly visible.

“Large, round, but I can’t tell if it’s a peach or a full moon…” Xu Qi’an instinctively evaluated in his mind before averting his gaze.

He couldn’t keep staring; it would make him seem lecherous.

“I heard you’re heading to the Northern Frontier to investigate the Blood Runs Three` Thousand Miles case?” she suddenly asked.

“Mm.” Xu Qi’an nodded curtly.

“What kind of case is it?” she continued.

“I’m not sure yet, but I suspect it’s about the barbarian tribes invading the border, committing arson and massacres, slaughtering thousands of miles, while Zhenbei King remains holed up in his city,” Xu Qi’an replied with his conjecture.

“Oh!”

She nodded and remarked, “If that’s the case, aren’t you afraid of offending Zhenbei King?”

“Of course I am.”

Xu Qi’an sighed. “If the case hadn’t been assigned to me, I would’ve just turned a blind eye and minded my own business. But it landed on my lap. Maybe it’s fate, and if it’s fate, I have to look into it.”

She said nothing more, squinting her eyes and enjoying the cool breeze from the river.

Xu Qi’an’s eyes glinted with mischief as he grinned. “Last year, on a trip to Yunzhou, I encountered something strange on the river.”

Her interest piqued instantly, and she tilted her head slightly.

“During the journey, a soldier came to the deck at night. Just like you now, he leaned on the railing and stared at the water. And then… and then…”

Xu Qi’an fixed his gaze on the river, his expression turning into one of horror.

She stared nervously at the river, fully engrossed.

“Then, a water ghost leapt out of the river!” Xu Qi’an declared gravely.

“N- nonsense…”

Her face paled as fear flickered in her eyes. Yet, she tried to maintain her composure. “You’re just trying to scare me.”

_Splash!_

Suddenly, a sound came from the water, splashing droplets everywhere.

She screamed and fell on her bottom, hugging her head in fright.

“Ha ha ha ha!”

Xu Qi’an burst into laughter, clutching his stomach as he pointed at her disheveled state. “Just a wine jar, and you’re scared stiff.”

The old auntie silently stood, her face icy with anger. Without saying a word, she turned and left.

_Is she mad?_ Xu Qi’an watched her retreating figure and called after her, “Hey, come back! Let’s chat some more, Auntie.”

…

At dawn, the government ship docked at the port of Huangyou County. As one of the few counties in Jianzhou with a port, Huangyou County’s economy was relatively developed.

The region was known for producing a translucent, yellow gem that resembled butter, aptly named Butter Jade.

The ship was scheduled to dock for a day. Xu Qi’an sent men ashore to procure supplies, dividing the imperial guards into two shifts—one to stay aboard, the other to explore the city. The two shifts would swap at noon.

*With some free time, I’ll head to the city after lunch, find a goulan, and bring some Nightwatcher colleagues along for fun. As for Yang Yan, let him stay aboard…*

As these thoughts ran through his head, Xu Qi’an suddenly heard the sound of retching from a corner of the deck.

Turning his head, he saw a familiar roundness—unclear if it was a peach or a full moon. The old aunt was hunched over the ship’s railing, vomiting repeatedly.

“Auntie, are you pregnant?” Xu Qi’an teased, pulling out a handkerchief and offering it to her.

She ignored him, using her own embroidered handkerchief to wipe her mouth. Her complexion was pale, her eyes bloodshot, as if she hadn’t slept all night.

“I noticed you didn’t look well yesterday. What’s wrong?” Xu Qi’an asked.

The old aunt glared at him, swaying her hips as she returned to her cabin.

She had spent the night too terrified to sleep, haunted by thoughts of fluttering bed curtains concealing ghostly eyes, hands creeping out from under the bed, or a disembodied head hanging outside her paper window…

Huddled under her blanket, too scared to sleep, she had occasionally peeked out to check her room, which only added to her exhaustion.

With the ship’s rocking and accumulated fatigue, her body finally gave in—her head throbbed, she felt nauseous, and she was utterly miserable.

_All because of that scoundrel!_

_Fine, ignore me if you want, but don’t blame me for enjoying the goulan without you…_ Xu Qi’an muttered to himself as he gathered his companions and disembarked.
