# 335. Question

Luo Yuheng froze, her beautiful eyes lighting up with a brilliant gleam. She looked at Chu Yuanzhen, pursed her lips, and said, “Xu Qi’an interfered in the Conflict of Heaven and Man... and defeated you and Li Miaozhen?”

Chu Yuanzhen nodded and gave a wry smile. “I don’t know why he acted so suddenly.”

In truth, he harboured a faint suspicion—it was Daoist Jinlian who subtly incited him, likely to avoid a life-and-death clash between members of the Heaven and Earth Society. However, this theory was something he could not share with Luo Yuheng.

“Explain in detail. How did he defeat you?” Luo Yuheng glanced at him briefly before casting her gaze toward the colorful flowers in the courtyard.

Chu Yuanzhen noticed that the National Teacher seemed to brighten in an instant, like the blooming flowers in the courtyard. The oppressive mood she carried earlier had lifted entirely.

“In fact, his victory over me and Li Miaozhen was thanks to external assistance. He possesses a Confucian tome containing many spells. But swords and artefacts are also external tools. A loss is a loss,” Chu Yuanzhen said with a magnanimous tone.

Luo Yuheng pondered aloud, “Confucian techniques alone shouldn’t have been enough to defeat both you and Li Miaozhen.”

Her tone was resolute.

Hearing this, Chu Yuanzhen’s expression turned strange. He gazed at Luo Yuheng’s peerless features and said in a low voice, “This is precisely what I wish to consult the National Teacher about…”

Pausing briefly, he continued in a tone of disbelief, “Xu Qi’an has advanced his Vajra Divine Art to the Minor Accomplishment stage. Without unsheathing my sword, I couldn’t break through his defences.

“But, National Teacher, he has only practiced the Vajra art for about a month. How could he have progressed to such a level?”

This wasn’t something that could be explained by simply calling him a “prodigy.” After much deliberation, Chu Yuanzhen thought back to the time Arhat Du'e claimed Xu Qi’an was a Buddha’s Son. Perhaps there was another layer of meaning to that declaration.

Luo Yuheng chuckled softly. “Not long ago, a cat came to see me, asking for an Azure Pill, saying it could delay the Conflict of Heaven and Man.”

*A cat? A cat demon? No, that didn’t make sense. The yao race couldn’t enter the capital, let alone Lingbao Temple… A being capable of entering Lingbao Temple in feline form and discussing the Conflict of Heaven and Man with the National Teacher was either an old friend of hers or a fellow Daoist of some renown...*

Chu Yuanzhen’s sharp mind immediately pinpointed a suspect: Daoist Jinlian.

From this, everything began to make sense. Xu Qi’an’s sudden interference in the Conflict of Heaven and Man was clearly incited by Daoist Jinlian.

Chu Yuanzhen knew the efficacy of the Azure Pill. He couldn’t help but recall how, during the battle, Xu Qi’an smugly remarked that both he and Li Miaozhen had helped temper his body...

Everything clicked into place. Daoist Jinlian had struck a deal with the National Teacher: he would help delay the Conflict of Heaven and Man, and in return, she would pay a certain price.

That price wasn’t just the Azure Pill—it had been given to Xu Qi’an. Daoist Jinlian likely had other motives as well.

Thus, Xu Qi’an’s rapid advancement in his Vajra Divine Art must have been due to the Azure Pill.

*Hearing that Xu Qi’an had defeated both him and Li Miaozhen, the National Teacher’s surprise wasn’t feigned... Hmm, it seems she wasn’t entirely confident in the arrangement either...* Chu Yuanzhen cupped his hands and said, “Li Miaozhen won’t challenge the Conflict of Heaven and Man again until she breaks through Xu Qi’an’s Vajra Divine Art. National Teacher, you can be rest assured.”

Luo Yuheng nodded slightly.

Seeing no need to linger, Chu Yuanzhen bid farewell and left.

Shortly after he departed, an orange tabby leaped onto the courtyard wall, its amber eyes gazing at Luo Yuheng with an inscrutable depth.

“I didn’t expect he could actually achieve this,” Luo Yuheng sighed softly.

“This only confirms my suspicions—there’s a secret hidden within his body,” the orange tabby said gravely.

“That day, after escaping from the ancient tomb, he told me that defeating the ancient corpse was thanks to a safeguard left by the Jianzheng within him. Hah, he thought I was just an ordinary Earth Sect Daoist, so I pretended to believe his nonsense.

“When I later saw how quickly his Vajra Divine Art advanced, it deepened my doubts. So, I nudged him into action to see how strong his physical body truly was.

“I didn’t expect him to request the Azure Pill outright and absorb its power so effortlessly, advancing his Vajra Divine Art to Minor Accomplishment.”

Luo Yuheng’s gaze turned serious as she looked at the orange tabby. “What’s your theory?”

The orange tabby pondered briefly before replying, “Based on my observations and the Jianzheng’s scheming, I suspect the secret within him is connected to the Buddhist sect. Don’t you think it’s strange that the Jianzheng specifically had him participate in the duel against the Buddhist sect? It’s as if he deliberately sent him into the Buddhist realm to practice the Vajra Art.”

“It’s not strange in itself, but when combined with everything else, it becomes rather suspicious,” Luo Yuheng murmured, her eyes unfocused as she stared at the still surface of the pond, lost in thought. “Could the Buddhist sect have also gotten involved?”

The orange tabby grinned mischievously. “The Jianzheng’s chess piece, the Buddhists’ Buddha son, and that peculiar fortune accompanying him… My dear junior sister, if you don’t make a decision soon, he might not agree to dual cultivation with you in the future.”

Luo Yuheng shot the orange tabby a sultry glare, her demeanor playful yet enchanting.

“You seem quite amused,” she said.

“Of course! The more secrets Xu Qi’an has, the less ordinary he is. This only increases the odds that he’ll help me slay demons in the future,” the orange tabby replied leisurely.

Luo Yuheng smirked and let out a soft “hmph.” “The gifts he’s received come with heavy costs. Senior brother, your optimism is premature.”

Hearing this, the orange tabby’s face froze, then it sighed deeply. “His life is full of tangled debts. When the time for reckoning comes, I only hope he can endure it. At that time, as his Daoist partner, you must stand by him.”

“Of course, I will—” Luo Yuheng began to respond instinctively but then realised her slip. Annoyed, she snapped, “Get out!”

…

The Imperial Palace.

The elderly eunuch dashed into the emperor’s bedchamber, his voice brimming with excitement. “Your Majesty, Your Majesty, wonderful news!”

The meditating Emperor Yuanjing opened his eyes instantly. Instead of chastising the eunuch for his lack of decorum, he sighed and remarked, “It must be that Chu Yuanzhen won, heh…”

And what if he won? At most, he has secured three moves’ worth of advantage for the National Teacher. The gap between second and first rank could not be bridged in three moves.

“No, no!” The eunuch exclaimed joyfully. “Your Majesty, the Conflict of Heaven and Man never took place. Silver Gong Xu stopped it.”

Emperor Yuanjing’s pupils constricted slightly, startled by the unexpected news. Leaning forward, he pressed, “Explain everything in detail.”

The eunuch dutifully recounted everything conveyed by the guards—Xu Qi’an’s sudden intervention, his impromptu verse, the agreement he made publicly with Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen, and the ensuing battle.

At the end, the eunuch beamed obsequiously and said, “Now, Your Majesty need not worry about the National Teacher. Ah, Silver Gong Xu is truly remarkable—he inspires such confidence.”

Just like in the Buddhist contest, and just like the numerous major cases during the official evaluation, whenever Silver Gong Xu was involved, everything seemed to resolve perfectly.

After finishing his report, the eunuch noticed Emperor Yuanjing staring blankly into the distance, lost in thought.

“Your Majesty?” the eunuch probed cautiously.

Emperor Yuanjing’s eyes flickered with renewed focus as he emerged from his reverie. Half to the eunuch and half to himself, he murmured, “We recall… even the Zhenbei King wasn’t this extraordinary in his youth…”

The eunuch immediately lowered his head, not daring to comment.

…

Somewhere else, the Gold Gongs, their minds in turmoil, returned to the Nightwatcher Constabulary. After a moment of consideration, Jiang Lyuzhong suggested, “Why don’t we all go together to see Duke Wei and inform him of this?”

Nangong Qianrou sneered, “To help Xu Qi’an claim credit, is it?”

Yang Yan, whose stoic expression seemed eternally chiseled into his face, replied coolly, “It doesn’t hurt to talk it over.”

The only thing capable of piquing this impassive man’s interest was martial arts. To Yang Yan, if the cold world had a warm harbour, it wouldn’t be the depths of desire that men yearn for, but the two words: _martial arts._

The eight Gold Gongs entered the Tower of Noble Spirit.

In the tearoom, Wei Yuan sat holding a book, with tea and snacks arranged neatly beside him. In the dazzling morning sunlight, he read leisurely.

“You’re back.”

Without lifting his head, Wei Yuan continued, “Let me guess who won. Hmm, Li Miaozhen has just advanced to the Fourth rank, her foundation is unstable. Chu Yuanzhen’s cultivation path is unconventional; the two should be evenly matched. But I heard from Xu Qi’an that Chu Yuanzhen has created a unique method for nurturing sword intent, with his three-foot blade sheathed for years. If he unsheathes it…”

As Wei Yuan mused aloud, like a strategist deducing the outcome of the Conflict of Heaven and Man, Yang Yan, struggling to hold back, wanted to interrupt and inform his foster father:

_You’ve got it all wrong. Things aren’t what you think._

But Jiang Lyuzhong and the others signaled him with their eyes or restrained him physically.

“So, I believe…” Wei Yuan, noticing their subtle gestures, paused. Seeing Yang Yan’s troubled face, he frowned and asked, “What’s the matter?”

Yang Yan immediately nodded and replied in a deep voice, “Father, Xu Qi’an won the Conflict of Heaven and Man.”

Having said that, Yang Yan felt as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. No longer would he have to watch his adoptive father’s misguided performance.

“???”

Wei Yuan rarely showed surprise, but this time, he froze, his face blank with disbelief. He then asked, astonished, “What did you say?”

“This morning at six, Xu Qi’an forcibly intervened in the Conflict of Heaven and Man. Alone, he challenged the two outstanding Daoist disciples, declaring that if they wanted to fight the Conflict, they would first have to defeat his Vajra Body…” Nangong Qianrou, knowing Yang Yan disliked long explanations, took over to recount the battle details for Wei Yuan.

“Although he relied on Confucian techniques to win against Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen, it’s undeniable that Xu Ningyan’s Vajra Body has grown strong enough to rival a Fourth rank martial artist’s physique,” Jiang Lyuzhong remarked, full of admiration.

The other Gold Gongs shared similar sentiments. Until today, their discussions of Xu Qi’an had carried a tone of condescension. But after today, Xu Qi’an, in their eyes, had ascended from a promising junior to someone who, though still slightly behind, was destined to catch up with them.

Wei Yuan remained silent for a long time. Then, recalling his earlier analysis, he offered a rare explanation: “Ah, I simply didn’t anticipate this.”

The Gold Gongs secretly found this amusing but maintained their composure, trained not to laugh easily.

Wei Yuan swept his gaze over them and said, “You’re dismissed. Leave me to my reading. I need peace.”

As the Gold Gongs turned to leave, Wei Yuan picked up his brush and swiftly wrote several notes. Summoning a clerk, he ordered, “Deliver these to the Gold Gongs.”

...

“Ha! It’s rare to see Duke Wei make a blunder—it’s strangely satisfying,” Jiang Lyuzhong chuckled as they descended the stairs.

“Blame Yang Yan! He couldn’t keep it to himself and got caught by Duke Wei,” Zhang Kaitai accused.

Even Nangong Qianrou allowed a faint smile to surface. He, too, found it oddly enjoyable to occasionally see their foster father slip up.

“Hahaha,” the Gold Gongs laughed together.

“Boring.” Yang Yan commented coolly.

Just as Jiang Lyuzhong, Yang Yan, and the others reached the bottom of the stairs, a clerk’s voice called out behind them, “Gold Gongs, please wait! Duke Wei has notes for you.”

The Gold Gongs exchanged confused looks before taking the notes. When they opened them, their expressions froze in shock.

“I have to take extra night watch shifts for a month, reason: frequently sneaking out of the Constabulary at night... But I only went to the Jiaofangsi once!” Jiang Lyuzhong exclaimed, dumbfounded.

“My pay is docked for three months, reason: I tortured a death-row prisoner to death during interrogation…” Nangong Qianrou’s lips twitched.

“I’ve been docked two months. The reason? Chu Yuanzhen, who I once defeated, now possesses strength equal to mine. Duke Wei believes I’ve grown complacent in my cultivation... But I’ve already reached the peak of the Fourth rank! Without a great opportunity, breaking into the Third rank is impossible.”

“I’ve been docked one month’s pay. And you think that’s bad? My reason is that I step out with my left foot first when exiting the door, which Duke Wei interprets as disrespect…”

The Gold Gongs simultaneously turned to look at Yang Yan. His hands were empty—no note.

“Interesting!” Yang Yan remarked indifferently.

“…” The Gold Gongs.

Back in the tearoom.

“A Vajra Body comparable to a Fourth rank martial artist… A Vajra Body comparable to a Fourth rank martial artist…” Wei Yuan tapped his fingers on the table, muttering to himself.

*Xu Qi’an, oh, Xu Qi’an.*

With a sigh, Wei Yuan stood and, with his hands behind his back, walked out of the tearoom. “Prepare the carriage. I must visit the Sitianjian.”

...

Xu Manor.

When Xu Qi’an woke, it was well past lunchtime. As he opened his eyes, a flood of pain filled his mind, causing him to groan.

“You’re awake.”

Susu sat by the bed, smiling as she looked at him.

Xu Qi’an nodded and, clutching his head, sat up. “I didn’t sleep long, did I? Ah… My head feels like it’s splitting open. But the aftereffects of Confucian magic aren’t as bad as I expected.”

Hearing this, Susu sneered, “Do you even realise you nearly died again?”

_I nearly died again? Why do I keep dying without knowing it myself?_ Xu Qi’an looked at the ghost maiden with a blank expression.

“Strictly speaking, your soul left your body. If it hadn’t returned within seven days, you’d have been truly dead,” Susu said, wrinkling her nose. “It was my master who retrieved your soul. She repaid evil with virtue—so magnanimous! And look at you—she treats you as a friend, and you stab her in the back. Hmph, despicable.”

Xu Qi’an reached out and poked Susu hard in the chest. With a soft _pop,_ the paper-thin form tore.

Susu gasped in shock, clutching her chest as she ran out crying, “Master! Xu Ningyan broke my chest! Fix it for me!”

A few minutes later, Xu Lingyin bounded in, holding a half-eaten chicken leg. She approached the bed and offered it to Xu Qi’an, saying, “Big Brother, eat this chicken leg.”

“Where did this come from?” Xu Qi’an asked, slightly disgusted. “It’s covered in your saliva.”

“I saved it at lunchtime.”

The Little Pea hopped in place and said loudly, “Eat it, and you’ll get better! My master said so.”

As she spoke, she frowned and explained earnestly, “But I really wanted to eat it, so I secretly took a bite. Just pretend you didn’t notice, okay?”

When Xu Qi’an didn’t respond, she repeated even louder, “Okay?!”

Xu Qi'an finally took the chicken leg and started chomping on it. Little Pea stood by the bedside, watching with wide, eager eyes, swallowing her saliva.

When Li Miaozhen entered the room with her ghostly maid, she saw the pair sitting by the bed, taking turns biting into the chicken leg. She froze for a moment, her cold expression softening ever so slightly.

She had finally changed out of her Daoist robe, wearing a light pink cross-collar long dress. A matching satin belt cinched her slender waist, and the intricate cloud patterns on her sleeves exuded elegance. Her posture was upright, and her slim figure radiated the charm of a well-bred young maiden.

But her overly sharp aura disrupted the image.

Xu Qi'an thought she would look better in light armor or uniforms like camouflage or police attire—something that would highlight her sharp and capable nature.

The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect sat at the round table, her face stern and icy as she said, "I need a reason."

_A reason? Does she really need one?_ Xu Qi'an's mind raced through a line from Stephen Chow's movies, but he dared not utter it aloud for fear of being beaten to death by Li Miaozhen.

"Daoist Jinlian asked me for help and offered an Azure Pill as payment. I had no reason to refuse," Xu Qi'an explained.

"You knew the Conflict of Heaven and Man was inevitable. Why did you insist on getting involved? Is the Azure Pill more important than your life?" Li Miaozhen asked angrily.

_You don’t understand. I carry too many secrets. Strength is my only leverage…_ Xu Qi'an smiled and said, "If the Heaven Sect ordered you to kill me, would you?"

"I wouldn’t," Li Miaozhen replied without hesitation. She didn't spout any nonsense about how hard it was to disobey her sect but instead told him seriously, "But if I can’t beat you, the elders in the sect will act. Believe me, they won’t kill you out of malice, but when they kill, they do it without any conscience.

"And it’s not just killing you. If necessary, they wouldn’t blink at razing a city to the ground. Of course, they wouldn’t stoop to such a thing lightly."

_Fuck me, the Heaven Sect sounds scarier than an evil cult. At least evil cults know they’re doing bad things or have some twisted justification for it. The Heaven Sect, on the other hand, is utterly emotionless…_ Xu Qi'an mused and then asked, "Will you become like that one day?"

Li Miaozhen was startled. In his weary eyes, she saw genuine concern, untainted by any ulterior motive.

They silently stared at each other for a few seconds before she nodded. "I will."

Xu Qi'an gave a bitter smile. "That’s a truly saddening thought."

The room fell into a quarter-hour-long silence, with neither of them speaking. Meanwhile, Xu Lingyin lay in her big brother's arms, deeply engrossed in sucking on the chicken leg bone.

"I'll help you manage things with the sect. If it truly comes to that, surrender in time. Our Heaven Sect never holds grudges," Li Miaozhen said finally.

_Because it's not worth remembering, is it…_ Xu Qi'an nodded. "Alright."

After Li Miaozhen left, Xu Qi'an gently patted Xu Lingyin on the head and said softly, "Help your big brother fetch Lina. I have something to ask her."

"Okay!"

Little Pea hopped off the bed, clutching the chicken bone, and waddled off, her little plump body swaying as she went.

Before long, Lina, the Southern Marches girl, came in with a light spring in her step. Her vibrant energy filled the room as her perpetually smiling eyes curved, and she greeted him with a cheerful, "What’s up?"

She spoke in her thick Southern Marches accent.

"Lina, you've been staying at my house for a while now. Is there anything you're unhappy with?" Xu Qi'an asked with a kind smile.

Lina tilted her head and thought for a moment before saying, "Nope."

The food here is way better than in the Southern Marches. Even the vegetarian dishes taste so fresh and delicious. The streets are so wide, the houses so big, and the beds so comfortable… Honestly, Lina didn’t even want to go back to the Southern Marches. As long as this family didn’t kick her out, she could stay forever.

"As long as you're satisfied. We people of the Great Feng are very hospitable," Xu Qi'an said. After a pause, he looked into Lina's eyes and continued, "There's something I’ve been meaning to ask you. How did you know I was the one who picked up the silver? What else do you know? Who told you?"
