# 377. Return to the Capital

“Knock, knock…”

The sound of knuckles against the door echoed twice. Inside, there was no response. Xu Qi’an tilted his head slightly, listening closely, and caught the faint and even rhythm of someone’s breathing.

*The sun’s already shining on your arse, and you’re still sleeping. How carefree can this woman be?* Xu Qi’an muttered to himself, placing his palm against the door. With a gentle push of his qi, the latch clicked open.

Stepping into the room, he found it neat and tidy, though the windows were shut tight. On the round table, four teacups were overturned, save for one, which still held some leftover tea.

Draped over the screen directly facing the door were a light skirt, robes, and a pale pink *dudou* embroidered with plum blossoms.

She must have bathed early last night, then fallen straight to bed, leaving her clothes and intimate garments unattended.

*This is the personal lingerie of the most beautiful woman in the Great Feng. In my era, something like this would’ve fetched a fortune online... not in silver taels, but in yuan…* Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly as he scanned the room. He didn’t see the earth book fragment, but his connection to the treasure guided him to its hiding place—it had been wedged under a table leg to keep it steady.

*Suddenly I want to teach her what a firm hand really is...* Xu Qi’an retrieved the fragment, tucking it safely into his robes.

This woman had no sense of its value. This little jade mirror housed all of Xu Qi’an’s life savings!

Turning to look at the bed, he saw her sleeping soundly on her side. Her posture was graceful, even demure—befitting a princess consort.

But when she wakes up… that’s another story entirely.

Time ticked by. The faint trickle of water from the water clock accompanied the scene. Occasionally, the woman on the bed would murmur softly, shift restlessly, or frown as though resisting some unpleasant dream. Her legs would kick out in defiance, as if warding off an unseen foe.

She was not sleeping peacefully.

By the time the clock struck nine. she let out a faint moan and slowly opened her eyes.

A moment later, Xu Qi’an watched as her body stiffened in shock. Gradually, she relaxed. He sipped from a teacup and greeted her with a faint smile, “You’re awake?”

Upon seeing him, a flicker of joy flashed in her eyes, but she quickly masked it with an air of nonchalance as she propped herself up.

“You’ve come back,” she said, feigning indifference. “Ah, I see—you’ve finally realised, haven’t you? The Zhenbei King is Rank Three, the most powerful person in all of the Great Feng. It’s wise of you to avoid unnecessary risks.”

Her tone softened slightly as she continued, “Leave this matter to the court. There’s no need for you to act recklessly.”

She had tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep. Of course, her restlessness had nothing to do with worrying about whether Xu Qi’an would die at the Zhenbei King’s hands...

Xu Qi’an replied flatly, “The Zhenbei King is dead.”

The princess consort froze, as if turned to stone.

“I… I don’t believe you…” Her gaze locked onto Xu Qi’an with unyielding intensity.

“This isn’t something to joke about,” Xu Qi’an said irritably. “A king’s death is no trivial matter. Why would I lie to you about this?”

Her blank stare lingered for a long moment. Her lips quivered as she asked, “Is… is it true?”

Xu Qi’an nodded.

He watched as her long lashes trembled, and a single tear slipped free, followed by another, and then more, cascading down her cheeks like pearls from a broken string.

She wept for her freedom.

Xu Qi’an thought to himself that they weren’t close enough for this level of emotional display. So, he simply observed, letting the Great Feng’s most beautiful woman cry her heart out.

Once her tears subsided, Xu Qi’an offered a curt summary, “You’re free now. The world is vast—go wherever you please. You’re like Mundo.”

Between sniffles, she wiped her tears and asked, “Who’s Mundo?”

Such a pointless question wasn’t worth answering, so Xu Qi’an ignored her.

While they ate breakfast, the princess consort—having regained her composure—lowered her voice conspiratorially, “Was it you who killed him?”

Xu Qi’an shook his head. “How strong is the Zhenbei King? I can’t beat him. A mysterious expert appeared and struck him down. The members of the delegation can vouch for this. You’ll find out the truth eventually.”

The princess consort let out an “oh” of understanding. She didn’t really believe Xu Qi’an was capable of such a feat. She was an intelligent, rational woman, not one of those naive girls in the capital who blindly worshipped Silver Gong Xu.

The Zhenbei King, ruthless and arrogant as he was, possessed undeniable strength—a level far beyond the current Xu Qi’an.

She nibbled on a scallion pancake, her oily fingers gleaming. Her bright eyes lingered on Xu Qi’an’s head. “Your hair... it’s grown back?”

“I always had hair.”

“You didn’t.”

“I did.”

“You—”

She was silenced by a flick of his chopsticks to her hand. Wisely, she changed her tune, “You did.”

Thanks to Shenshu’s immense power, Xu Qi’an’s hair had finally regrown. A Rank Three martial artist could regenerate limbs, hair was trivial in comparison.

This was a small joy for Xu Qi’an. An even greater joy was that he’d kept his baldness a secret by wearing a fur hat. No one had seen the awkward regrowth stage.

*I’ll still need to wear it for a while longer. When the appropriate time has passed, then I’ll remove it… Then, I’ll once again be the long-haired, carefree young man.* Xu Qi’an thought happily.

After breakfast, he sat at the dressing table. The mirror reflected his restored visage—sword-like brows, starry eyes, a straight nose, thin lips, and sharply defined features exuding masculine strength.

He was a stark contrast to the gentle and refined Xu Erlang or the delicate beauty of Nangong Qianrou.

The princess consort, sitting on the bed and swinging her feet, watched him tie his hair. “What about me?” she asked. “What should I do now?”

Xu Qi’an, tying his topknot with an air of indifference, replied, “I told you—go wherever you want.”

Realising he had no intention of involving himself further, she huffed and said, “Lend me another ten taels of silver. I’ll return to the Mu family in Jiangnan. Once I have money, I’ll repay you.”

“Clink.”

Xu Qi’an placed a silver ingot on the table.

*Such decisiveness...* The princess consort bit her lip, pocketed the silver, and silently packed her few belongings, including some dirty intimate garments. Slinging a small bundle over her shoulder, she declared, “I’m leaving.”

“Off you go,” Xu Qi’an replied with a nod.

She gave him a long, lingering look, then abruptly turned and fled the room.

Exiting the inn, she walked alone towards the city gates, weaving through bustling crowds, noisy markets, and long streets. This wasn’t a large city; soon enough, she reached the gates.

But as she stood before the broad entrance, she hesitated. It didn’t feel like the path to freedom. The world outside was vast and treacherous, its people cunning and unpredictable.

She’d been sent to the palace at thirteen, a pawn traded by her family for wealth and status. She had spent years in the imperial harem, only to be gifted to Zhenbei King, where she lived another twenty years in captivity.

She longed for freedom, for a life unbound. Yet now that it was within her grasp, she realised she had no means to survive outside.

Like a canary in a gilded cage, decades of comfort had left her incapable of taking flight.

Returning to her “maiden home” wasn’t an option either. It would only mean being sold again—no, more likely, she’d be sent back to the palace the moment she arrived.

She stood frozen at the gates, unsure and adrift. Gradually, the light in her eyes dimmed, replaced by a deep emptiness.

The princess consort lowered her head, staring at her feet. Her frail shoulders hunched, her figure shrinking into itself. Alone, she stood there—a small, lost girl with nowhere to go.

At this moment, a man's sigh came from behind, "Little Auntie, I've thought about it, and decided I must take you with me."

The princess consort, sulking, did not turn around.

Xu Qi’an walked to her, crouched down, and remained silent.

Hearing his words, the princess consort shot a glare at his back. Her lips curved into a faint smile as she stretched out her arms and leapt onto his back.

Once out of the city, Xu Qi’an carried her as he sprinted down the official road. At that moment, he couldn’t help but miss his beloved little mare.

“I’m quite troublesome, you know,” the princess consort murmured softly into his ear.

Her warm breath brushed against Xu Qi’an’s earlobe, making him furrow his brows. The earlobe was one of Freeloader Xu’s sensitive zones—a secret only Fuxiang knew.

*You’re at least self-aware…* Xu Qi’an asked, “Does Emperor Yuanjing know about this look of yours?”

The princess consort shook her head. “But he knows I have an artefact that changes my appearance. I’ve snuck out several times; he surely knows about that. But he’s never seen this form of mine.”

She pondered for a moment and added, “The guards in the king’s manor have seen me like this.”

Xu Qi’an didn’t reply, lost in thought.

*Even though the Zhenbei King is dead, the princess consort is still a wanted figure. Emperor Yuanjing would never turn a blind eye to her, even if the entire delegation believed that she had been abducted by the barbarians,*

*Those maids know that I was the last to find them. Of course, they don’t know I defeated the barbarian warriors and rescued the princess consort. But the mere fact they survived and returned safely to the capital is suspicious in itself.*

*Although it cannot serve as evidence that I rescued the princess consort, as long as there’s doubt, Emperor Yuanjing will certainly investigate. He wouldn’t even bother to be discreet—he’d investigate openly.*

*So, the princess consort cannot return to my manor but can be hidden outside the capital.*

*With a population of three million in the capital, it’s impossible to search every household. Besides, there’s no evidence pointing to me bringing her back to the city.*

*The best plan is to hide her outside the capital, not too far from my manor but not too close either.*

After considering the details, Xu Qi’an nodded in satisfaction, feeling confident in his plan.

Then, inevitably, a sense of confusion swept over him. *Why am I going to such lengths for an older auntie? When did I fall under her spell?*

Xu Qi’an did not head towards Chuzhou City but instead planned to rendezvous with Zheng Xinghuai and take him there.

Now that Chuzhou City lay in ruins, as Chuzhou’s Chief Minister, Zheng Xinghuai needed to handle the aftermath and be informed that Zhenbei King had perished, allowing him to stop hiding.

On the way, Xu Qi’an deliberately asked Daoist Jinlian to shield their Heaven and Earth Society communication while he privately messaged Li Miaozhen to ask her location.

Unsurprisingly, he was met with a torrent of anger from the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect, before she informed him about Zhenbei King’s demise afterward.

Xu Qi’an feigned great shock, exclaiming in disbelief. He performed the perfect act of a “shocked clique” member, adhering to its core values.

This left Li Miaozhen feeling slightly smug, reducing her anger at being stood up.

Subsequently, Xu Qi’an asked her to leave Chuzhou City under the pretext of “meeting Silver Gong Xu on his way,” and to join them at the valley.

By midday, Xu Qi’an reached the valley. After bidding farewell to Zheng Xinghuai the previous day, he had found an inn in a nearby county town to house the princess consort, as it wasn’t far.

…

Inside a cave, a bonfire blazed. Li Han and Zhao Jin, two brothers-in-arms, roasted game—wild chicken, hare, and fresh fish.

The tall and lean Shentu Baili sat cross-legged, meditating with closed eyes.

The burly Wei Youlong cleaned a large blade, his deep voice rumbling, “I wonder how Silver Gong Xu and Lady Flying Swallow are faring. If Que Yongxiu and the Zhenbei King discover any clues, it could mean certain death. Should they fall into trouble, it’s likely we’ll be implicated too.”

Tang Youshen, a spear-wielding soldier from the army, swept his sharp gaze towards the cave entrance before closing his eyes and resting, cradling his long spear.

Zheng Xinghuai waved his hand, his voice calm yet certain, “That won’t happen. Even if they find nothing, neither the Zhenbei King nor Que Yongxiu will catch on to them.”

A beautiful young woman asked, “Lord Zheng, why are you so confident?”

Zheng Xinghuai replied, “Lady Flying Swallow roams the Jianghu, renowned for meddling in others’ affairs. To achieve such fame and remain unharmed, she cannot be reckless. As for Silver Gong Xu, solving one major case might be luck, but his consistent success proves his capability.”

The group nodded slowly in agreement.

Both Lady Flying Swallow and Silver Gong Xu were reassuring figures—natural leaders who instilled confidence, leaving no room for fear or worry when they took charge.

Suddenly, Shentu Baili’s eyes snapped open, his voice low and urgent, “Someone’s coming.”

Li Han and Zhao Jin instinctively dropped their game and grabbed their weapons, rushing out of the cave with the others.

A man and a woman approached.

The man, masculine and handsome, exuded an extraordinary aura—it was none other than Silver Gong Xu Qi’an. As for the woman, one glance was enough to dismiss her. Her gait was awkward and uncoordinated, trailing behind Xu Qi’an with laboured breaths. She was plain and utterly ordinary.

Zheng Xinghuai stepped forward to greet them, cupping his hands, “Silver Gong Xu.”

The martial artists behind him looked puzzled. Silver Gong Xu had vowed the previous night to investigate Chuzhou City, yet here he was today. The distance to Chuzhou City was hundreds of li—hardly enough time for a round trip.

Without wasting words, Xu Qi’an cut straight to the point, “I’ve received word—the Zhenbei King has fallen in Chuzhou City. I’m here to take you all there.”

A bolt from the blue!

Zheng Xinghuai’s expression froze instantly. His eyes widened, and his jaw slackened, making Xu Qi’an understand what really was the true essence of a “shocked clique” member.

The martial artists exchanged silent glances, all sharing the same incredulous thought.

“Could… could the information be wrong…” Zheng Xinghuai took a few steps forward, his face a mix of hope and disbelief, unwilling to accept or reject the news.

Shentu Baili and the others remained silent, quietly agreeing with their lord’s assessment.

*It’s absolutely true—I killed Zhenbei King with my own hands…* Xu Qi’an smiled and nodded. “No mistake, it’s true.”

*Thump, thump, thump…* Zheng Xinghuai could hear his own frantic, pounding heartbeat.

“Lady Flying Swallow will arrive shortly. She knows what transpired,” Xu Qi’an deflected, shifting the burden to her.

The group returned to the cave, their hearts aflutter with anticipation.

The princess consort sat obediently next to Xu Qi’an, nibbling on a chicken leg. As the most beautiful woman in the Great Feng, she worked hard to play the part of an insignificant nobody.

During their journey, she had learned of Zheng Xinghuai’s identity from Xu Qi’an and understood that his family had perished in the massacre.

Although she and the Zhenbei King shared no affection, their official bond as husband and wife left her feeling guilty towards Sir Zheng.

Half an hour later, Li Miaozhen arrived at the valley. Descending gracefully from her flying sword, she landed lightly at the entrance.

She surveyed the group waiting at the cave’s entrance, nodding slightly. Her gaze lingered momentarily on the plain-looking princess consort.

“Lady Flying Swallow, Silver Gong Xu said… said… the Zhenbei King has fallen in Chuzhou City?”

Zheng Xinghuai stepped forward hurriedly, staring intently at her.

Li Miaozhen gave an affirmative reply: “Yes, his corpse is still in Chuzhou City.”

She then briefly recounted the battle in Chuzhou.

After listening, the Provincial Administrator Zheng nodded slowly. His bloodshot eyes swept over the group as he murmured, “This official... this official wishes to be alone for a moment.”

He clasped his hands in salute, turned around, and walked back into the cave.

A few seconds later, the sound of heart-wrenching sobs came from within.

Xu Qi’an sighed softly, only to hear Li Miaozhen’s voice transmission in his ear: “Who is she?”

“A pitiful soul,” he replied via voice transmission. “I do have something to ask of you. The case of ‘Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles’ has been settled, and you need not concern yourself with the aftermath. Can you take her back to the capital for me? Do not draw attention to yourselves; it would be best to rest at an inn first and wait for my return.”

Li Miaozhen gave no reply, only scrutinising the princess consort for a moment before curling her lips and transmitting, “A pitiful soul, so she needs to be taken to the capital and settled? This woman certainly has a childbearing physique, but since when have you become so desperate?”

*Miaozhen, I say this without intending offence, but if she takes off her bracelet, she could confidently proclaim: “All of you here are rubbish!”*

Noticing a trace of displeasure in Li Miaozhen’s tone, Xu Qi’an chose not to respond further and merely clasped his hands in a silent gesture.

He then turned to the princess consort and whispered, “She is a relative of my concubine’s family. You can trust her. Follow her back to the capital and heed her arrangements.”

The princess consort furrowed her brows slightly at these words. This was the first she had heard of Xu Qi’an having a concubine, but given his status and position—and considering he was a frequent visitor to the Jiaofangsi—was it not perfectly normal for him to have a concubine?

“Alright,” she responded coldly with a slight nod.

…

Three days later, after travelling day and night without rest, Provincial Administrator Zheng finally returned to Chuzhou City after more than a month in hiding.

Zheng Xinghuai, his hair now salt-and-pepper white, climbed step by step to the city wall. Before him, the once-flourishing Chuzhou City had been reduced to ruins, with remnants of destruction everywhere and the land scarred beyond recognition.

The northern city wall had collapsed halfway, and the western city gate had been smashed to pieces.

Over twenty thousand soldiers were scattered throughout the city, each occupied with their duties. Some were scavenging for grain, rice, and other food supplies. Despite the extensive damage to the city, goods stored in cellars remained intact, and even within the collapsed ruins, valuable materials could be unearthed.

Others were constructing temporary shelters to serve as barracks, providing lodging for their brigade. 

Some soldiers were repairing the city walls.

Still others were burying the dead—comrades, city residents, and even barbarian and Yao corpses.

These operations had been proceeding in an orderly manner for three days.

“This will surely be recorded in the annals of history, serving as a warning to future generations. At the same time, the crimes of the Zhenbei King will be documented to ensure his eternal infamy.”

Censor Liu appeared beside him. From Li Miaozhen, the delegation had already learned of Zheng Xinghuai’s miraculous survival, understanding that the person they had encountered in the city before was an imposter—likely the work of that rank three Warlock, for it would have been impossible to deceive a fourth rank such as Yang Yan otherwise.

“Do you truly believe the court will convict the Zhenbei King of his crimes?” Provincial Administrator Zheng asked in a low voice.

“Victory must be fought for,” Censor Liu replied, enunciating each word clearly.

At this moment, Xu Qi’an, Yang Yan, Chief Constable Chen, and others ascended the city wall. Leading the team, Silver Gong Xu declared in a sombre tone, “Afterwards, we shall return to the capital to ensure the Zhenbei King is held accountable and bring this case to its conclusion.

“But before that, I imagine Provincial Administrator Zheng would wish to pour a few cups of humble wine in honour of the fallen souls in this city.”

Centurion Chen Xiao stepped forward, carrying a wine jug in his hand.

Taking the jug, Provincial Administrator Zheng once again gazed at the city below. Before offering libations, he wanted to spend some time reminiscing about the first half of his life.

...

Zheng Xinghuai was born in Zhangzhou, one of the two major breadbaskets of the Great Feng, but his family was impoverished during his youth. He and his widowed mother relied on her meagre earnings from washing clothes and embroidery for wealthier families to scrape by.

As a boy, Zheng Xinghuai most eagerly anticipated the autumn harvest, when he could gather leftover grain from the fields.

With a basketful of grain, he and his widowed mother could enjoy three days of porridge. But they could not gather too much, for fear of a beating.

After the autumn harvest, the harshest times were in winter. Every winter, his hands and feet would crack from the cold, while his mother, even in the freezing weather, would wash clothes in icy rivers for a few copper coins.

It was through these small labours that his mother managed to save enough for his tuition, enough silver to send him to the National Academy.

At the age of sixteen, Zheng Xinghuai entered the National Academy and studied arduously for ten years. In the nineteenth year of Yuanjing, he passed the imperial examination as a second-rank scholar.

Without delay, he rushed home to share the joyous news with his mother, to bring her to live with him in the capital, and to make her proud, silencing those who had once sneered at them.

But what awaited him was a modest grave.

His mother had passed away many years ago, never telling him, with relatives writing letters in her stead. That hardworking, humble woman who had toiled for a lifetime did not want to distract her son from his studies.

Zheng Xinghuai knelt at his mother’s grave for a day and a night.

His official career was not smooth. His rigid principles and refusal to compromise offended the then-Prime Minister, leading to his demotion to Chuzhou in the northern frontier as an eighth-rank county magistrate.

Initially, Zheng Xinghuai did not care for Chuzhou. The northern frontier was bitterly cold, and its people were fierce and unruly. Even so, he exhausted his savings to bribe connections in hopes of transferring back to the capital.

Until one year, when the barbarian cavalry raided, plundering for miles.

In the aftermath, Zheng Xinghuai was dispatched to inspect the situation and console the people. Walking along the paths between the fields, he saw crops trampled by iron hooves. On the main roads, he saw corpses devoured, leaving only mangled remains. In the mountains, he found survivors, their faces marked by poverty and hardship.

He thought of his mother, who had passed away many years ago.

Later, when the Prime Minister retired, Zheng’s classmates and friends in court manoeuvred to bring him back to the capital.

But by then, Zheng Xinghuai no longer wished to leave Chuzhou. He had poured all his energy and dedication into this land.

He worked tirelessly, often over sleepless nights as he handled official matters. It was as though, through his efforts, he could somehow make up for the regrets he felt towards his late mother.

Time flew by, and eighteen years passed in the blink of an eye. Most of his life had been devoted to Chuzhou, and now he found himself alone and desolate.

“Fame and fortune are but ashes in the wind...” Overcome with sorrow, Zheng Xinghuai wept.

The wine poured forth, raising a small cloud of dust.

...

No one spoke for a long time. Once Zheng Xinghuai’s emotions calmed, the Deputy Minister of the High Court cleared his throat and said:

“Que Yongxiu has fled in disgrace, and the Zhenbei King has been executed, but their crimes have yet to be proclaimed to the world. Provincial Administrator Zheng is a key witness and must return to the capital with us. However, given the current state of Chuzhou City and the northern frontier, someone must stay to oversee the situation...”

Imperial Censor Liu frowned and reasoned, “The massacre of 380,000 residents in Chuzhou City makes the aftermath straightforward to deal with; settling the twenty thousand soldiers is the main priority.

“As for the other prefectures and counties, they can remain as they are; no special arrangements are necessary. As for the barbarians and Yao clans, after this great battle, they have been utterly terrified. They fear that mysterious expert and will not dare to invade the borderlands for the foreseeable future—perhaps not for many years.”

Zheng Xinghuai pondered for a moment, then turned to Yang Yan. "Scholars do not command troops. I am skilled at managing civil affairs but am an outsider when it comes to leading soldiers. Gold Gong Yang, you are the highest-ranked here in cultivation and have experience in commanding troops. You are capable of both management and maintaining discipline among the soldiers."

Yang Yan nodded slightly and said indifferently, "Understood."

*Boss is essentially an upgraded version of Zhu Guangxiao—silent, hardworking, and utterly dependable…* Xu Qi’an refrained from speaking throughout the discussion.

This was because everything he wanted to say had already been covered by the civil officials.

"By the way," he suddenly remembered something. "The corpse of the Zhenbei King must be brought back to the capital. He is the central figure in this case. Even in death, he must return to the capital."

"Naturally," Provincial Administrator Zheng nodded.

The Zhenbei King’s corpse had to be returned to the capital, no matter what.

This case was far from over; killing the Zhenbei King was just the beginning. Properly defining the case and bringing it to a conclusion was the true final step.

Seeing that the discussion had concluded, Yang Yan turned to Xu Qi’an and said in a deep voice, "Come with me."

*Boss, your stern demeanour and commanding tone remind me of my headteacher from secondary school…* Xu Qi’an obediently followed.

The two walked along the city walls until they had put some distance between themselves and the others. Yang Yan then stopped, turned around, and said:

"When the Zhenbei King performed the sacrificial ritual on the city’s populace, I saw their souls being drawn into the ground. It seemed as though there was another formation beneath the earth. Yet, when I later dug deep into the ground, I found nothing."

*Souls being drawn underground? What sort of sorcery is this? Wasn’t the Zhenbei King slaughtering the city to refine blood pills?* Xu Qi’an’s first thought upon hearing this was:

*Miaozhen, I need you!*

When it came to matters involving souls, the best course of action was to consult Li Miaozhen. If she wasn’t skilled enough, no matter—there was always that wily Daoist Jinlian.

Yang Yan stared at him and asked, "Do you have any leads?"

*Ah, the benefit of having connections is becoming clear. I really need to expand my metaphorical fishpond. Oh, and I haven’t yet given the butter jade-carved miniature sword to that military woman…* Xu Qi’an’s thoughts wandered briefly before he replied in a steady voice:

"Boss, please wait a moment. I need to go to the latrine."

Yang Yan was aware that Xu Qi’an possessed a fragment of the Earth Book. After all, it was he who had single-handedly taken down the Daoist Zilian.

Descending from the city wall, Xu Qi’an found a secluded corner and took out his fragment of the Earth Book. Assuming the identity of Number Three, he sent a message:

【Daoist Jinlian, I need to speak with you privately.】

Late at night, the rest of the Heaven and Earth Society felt rather irked upon seeing this message.

Lately, that nun Li Miaozhen had been demanding to exclude everyone from her conversations every three days. Now Number Three was following suit.

A few seconds later, Daoist Jinlian responded:

【What is it?】

【THREE: Where’s Miaozhen? Miaozhen can join the discussion.】

… Daoist Jinlian sighed and replied:

【Miaozhen, you may respond.】

【TWO: What’s the matter? Speak up if you have something to say, or hold your peace if not.】

*What’s with the temper?* Xu Qi’an messaged back:

【You seem upset. What’s wrong?】

Li Miaozhen:

【Hah, it’s that woman again. She’s practically treating me like a maid. If someone didn’t know better, they’d think she was the princess consort. The sheer audacity of her entitlement is infuriating.】

*Are you, like Zhong Li, also a Master of Prophecy?* Xu Qi’an consoled the holy maiden:

【Don’t take it to heart. She’s just used to that kind of treatment.】

The princess consort, foolish as she might be, likely wasn’t doing it on purpose. She had spent half her life as a princess consort, surrounded by luxury and served by maids. Habits like that didn’t just change overnight.

Unless Li Miaozhen disciplined her constantly, as Xu Qi’an had done.

Li Miaozhen:【Get to the point, or stop bothering me during my meditation.】

*Still clearly angry… I’d better pacify her.* Xu Qi’an messaged:

【I don’t think you need to work so hard. With the talent of our Lady Flying Swallow, devoting just part of your energy to cultivation is enough to outshine your peers.】

Li Miaozhen replied:【Hmph, I think you’re lying to me.】

Her mood seemed to improve slightly.

Xu Qi’an:【What do you think, Daoist Jinlian?】

Daoist Jinlian:【I think neither of you respect me.】

The chat fell silent, like a noisy classroom suddenly silenced by the arrival of the headteacher. Xu Qi’an and Li Miaozhen dared not continue their idle chatter. The former quickly shifted the topic and explained the situation:

【It’s like this: when the Zhenbei King sacrificed the citizens of Chuzhou, Yang Yan witnessed their souls being drawn underground. Yet, no trace of anything was found later.】

Li Miaozhen asked:

【Were there any remnants of a formation?】

*Yang Yan hadn’t mentioned it, so there likely weren’t any...* Xu Qi’an replied:【None.】

Li Miaozhen fell silent.

After a pause, Daoist Jinlian messaged:

【From what Miaozhen described a few days ago, the key players involved were the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect and the Church of the Warlock God. Hah, both are masters of the soul domain. A formation would be optional for them.

【Hmm, while the Daoist schools and the Church of the Warlock God refine and cultivate ghosts, they wouldn’t typically collect so many souls. Unless they were trying to refine a soul pill.】

*Ah, an elder is truly a treasure. Daoist Jinlian’s experience is invaluable…* Xu Qi’an asked:

【A Soul pill? What are those, and what are they used for?】

Daoist Jinlian replied:

【They have numerous uses: enhancing one’s primordial spirit, serving as alchemical ingredients, forging artefacts, repairing incomplete souls, nurturing spirit weapons, and so on. Perhaps the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader needed soul pills. Additionally, the resentment and malice generated by a city’s massacre—this kind of great evil in the world—is a tonic for him.】

*So the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader cooperated with the Zhenbei King to obtain a soul pill?* Xu Qi’an nodded in understanding.

【THREE: In that case, will he continue massacring cities? The Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect is of the Second Rank.】

Xu Qi’an asked worriedly.

【NINE: Heh, he wouldn’t dare. He’s on the verge of his heavenly tribulation. In… his current state, he wouldn’t dare to provoke it. So you needn’t worry about him slaughtering lives again—unless he has a death wish.】

Xu Qi’an immediately felt reassured.

Ending the transmission, he returned to the city wall.

Yang Yan looked over at once.

Xu Qi’an pondered and said, "I just remembered—the souls might have been refined into a soul pill. That was likely the reward for the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader in his collaboration with the Zhenbei King."

*A Soul pill…* the "greatest evil" that the Daoist Leader referred to? Yang Yan slowly nodded.

He had been present during the event. Though far away, he had heard it clearly.

*Next came the matter of defining the Chuzhou massacre case, ensuring that the Zhenbei King and Que Yongxiu bore their due sins. This would undoubtedly encounter resistance…* Yang Yan said:

"If anything arises, consult Duke Wei. Heed his advice and refrain from acting recklessly. Understand?"

After a pause, he added in a low voice, "If Duke Wei believes the matter cannot be opposed, do not insist on your way."

Xu Qi’an looked at him silently.

...

Early May, the onset of summer.

An official ship from Chuzhou cut through the waves, steadily entering the boundaries of the capital before finally docking at the city’s pier.

The members of the delegation stood on the deck, gazing at the bustling, lively pier with emotions surging within them.

When they had set out for Chuzhou, it had been late spring. Now, upon their return to the capital, it was early summer.

The events of this journey were enough to be recounted as tales of a lifetime for ordinary people.

As they breathed sighs of relief, a flame of resolve burned in their eyes.

They were bringing a momentous piece of news back to the capital.

The Great Feng will never have a Zhenbei King again.
