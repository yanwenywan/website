# 394. The fruiting of the lotus draws near

*Li Miaozhen is back? Or is it just the cleaning staff knocking?*

The princess consort hurriedly wiped away her tears, cleared her throat, and tried to sound calm. “Who is it?”

A familiar, rich voice came from outside the door, deliberately lowered. “It’s me. Open the door.”

The princess consort shot up from her seat. Her plain face flooded with uncontrollable joy and excitement, her beautiful eyes lighting up—but she quickly sat back down, turning her back to the door.

“Who are you? I don’t know you. Why should I open the door for you?”

“I’m your wild man from the shores of Daming Lake,” Xu Qi’an knocked on the door.

The princess consort spat in annoyance, her willow brows arching sharply. She scolded, “I don’t know you. Stop bothering me. Otherwise, I’ll call the innkeeper to throw you out.”

A scene from a play she had watched earlier that morning suddenly surfaced in her mind. In the play, the scholar didn’t win over the wealthy lady’s heart right away. There was a scene where the lady said, “If you truly care for me, wait outside the courtyard until the third watch. If I see you through my window, I will believe you.”

The scholar did exactly that, and so the lady believed in his sincerity.

The princess consort decided to test him. “If you’re sincere, then stand at the door until the third watch. If you do, I will believe you.”

After saying this, she eagerly anticipated his reaction.

Of course, she wouldn’t admit that she had any ambiguous relationship with him. It was simply that he had promised to take care of her. She thought he was certainly a lecher, but he was also a true hero.

So, she chose to believe him.

She and Xu Qi’an were innocent. They were not like the lovers in the play who secretly pledged themselves to each other.

These past few days, she had told herself countless times that their relationship was built on the unshakable honour of Jianghu heroes, not on anything improper between a man and a woman.

Only by believing this could she convince herself to accept his help. After all, she was a married woman. Her nominal husband had only just passed away—if she ran away with another man so soon, how scandalous would that be?

“Are you mental?!”

The voice outside the door cursed unceremoniously. “Are you opening the door or not?”

The princess consort huffed, “No.”

He simply said, “Since you like staying at the inn, then stay. I’ll come by regularly to pay your rent. I won’t bother you anymore. Farewell.”

Her shoulders twitched slightly, and she instinctively wanted to turn around—but she held back.

She waited in silence for a moment and found that there was really no more sound outside the door.

Finally, she couldn’t resist looking back.

The corridor outside was empty.

Her heart sank. A nameless fear surged through her. She quickly got up, strode to the door, flung it open, and looked around.

The corridor was deserted.

Panic-stricken, she ran through the long corridor, lifted her skirt, and hurried down the stairs, chasing after him.

Then, outside the inn, on the street, she saw a man standing there.

His features were gentle, plain, and unremarkable.

He smiled at her, eyes squinting. “Let’s go.”

For some reason, upon seeing him, the princess consort let go of all her pretence, abandoned all her grievances and anger, and chose to follow him.

…

Xu Qi’an bought a small courtyard house—not too close, but not too far from Xu Manor. It faced south, with two side rooms to the east and west.

“This house is a property I purchased under a false name. No one will trace it back to me. And in my current appearance, no one recognises me. You can live here in peace.”

Xu Qi’an took out a key, unlocked the courtyard door, and said, “From now on, you’ll be living here alone. Your identity is sensitive, so I can’t hire maids or attendants for you.

“You’ll have to learn to handle many things yourself—washing clothes, cooking, sweeping the courtyard. Of course, I’ll leave you some silver. If the chores are too much, you can hire people. But if you can manage by yourself, try to do so.

“The security in the inner city is excellent. In the daytime, there’s nothing to worry about. At night, there are Nightwatchers and Yudao Guards patrolling. You can live here without concern.”

The princess consort took the key he handed her, gripping it in her small hand without responding.

Xu Qi’an hesitated, then said, “How about I come over every couple of days to stay?”

The princess consort was startled. She instinctively shielded her chest and backed away several steps.

*I didn’t mean I was going to sleep with you…* Xu Qi’an’s mouth twitched as he explained, “I can stay in the east wing. Or the west wing.”

The princess consort fell silent.

She neither agreed nor refused. This house was his property. If he insisted on staying with her, what could a weak woman like her do?

She entered the house and took a stroll around. She found that everything was fully stocked—pots, bowls, bedding, and furniture, all brand new.

Even the wardrobe contained a few sets of clothing that weren’t exactly new but weren’t old either.

“Whose clothes are these?” she asked in a slightly coquettish tone, in a surprisingly good mood.

“They belonged to my Auntie. I figured you two have a similar build, so they should fit.” Xu Qi’an’s voice came from outside.

“You want me to wear someone else’s old clothes?” The princess consort was incredulous.

Xu Qi’an leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, and teased, “There’s fine silk in the chest under the bed. You can make yourself a few new outfits.”

The princess consort was momentarily speechless, her brows drooping. “I don’t want to…”

*You still have a lot to learn. If that canary in a golden cage wants to fly free, it must first learn independence.* Xu Qi’an steeled himself and ignored her little sulk, then beckoned to her.

“Go draw a bucket of water from the well. Let me see your strength.”

Intrigued, the princess consort followed him outside. She reached the well and tried to draw water but quickly shook her head. “It’s too heavy. I can’t lift it.”

Xu Qi’an switched her to a smaller wooden bucket—about half a basin’s worth of water. Even Xu Lingyin could lift this much.

Sure enough, the princess consort managed to lift it.

“Ah, the bucket fell into the well.” Her hand slipped, and the bucket, along with the rope, plopped into the water. She looked at Xu Qi’an innocently.

“Why are you looking at me like you’re the victim?”

“How was I supposed to know it would fall in?”

“That just means you don’t realise your own mistake. Or, you’re trying to act pitiful with innocent eyes to gain my forgiveness.”

“I—I wasn’t acting pitiful!” The princess consort stomped her foot. “Then what do I do now?”

“This is when you need a man.” Xu Qi’an opened his palm, manipulated his qi, and drew the bucket back up.

*Need a man…* The princess consort huffed indignantly. “I’m a widow now. I don’t have a man.”

This was not a topic worth delving into—at least, not between them. Xu Qi’an smoothly changed the subject. “There are books in the study. You can read them to pass the time.”

Before she could refuse, he added, “Don’t worry, they’re all light novels and storybooks.”

The princess consort nodded slightly. “Then I’m interested.”

Reading could wait. She went inside, brought out a large wooden basin, fetched some water from the well, and took out the clothes belonging to Xu Qi’an’s Auntie, tossing them into the basin.

Awkwardly, she started scrubbing the clothes.

Xu Qi’an sat on the well’s edge, chewing on a blade of grass, watching as the former princess consort of Zhenbei King—once the most beautiful woman in Great Feng—sat on a small stool, earnestly washing clothes.

Her sleeves were rolled up, revealing two pale, delicate arms. The Bodhi prayer beads concealed her devastatingly beautiful face, but her natural grace was captivating even in fleeting moments.

Her beauty was not limited to her appearance.

“When do you plan to leave the capital?” Mu Nanzhi asked nonchalantly.

“How did you know I was leaving?” Xu Qi’an countered.

"I haven’t spent much time with him, but I know a little about his character—arrogant and conceited, he would never tolerate you. The only reason he hasn't retaliated yet is that the time isn’t right. If you think he’ll just let it go, you’ll end up suffering a miserable fate."

Mu Nanzhi brushed aside her fringe and snorted twice. "And he’s lecherous too. When I first entered the palace, the moment he laid eyes on me, he was completely dazed. It was then that I realised—even the emperor is no different from an ordinary man."

*That’s because you’re just too beautiful, Princess Consort. Not only did the emperor want to claim your beauty, but even the Rain God wanted to as well…* Xu Qi’an muttered inwardly.

"Can you take me with you when you leave the capital?" she probed cautiously.

"No." Xu Qi’an replied irritably.

Mu Nanzhi let out an "Oh," lowered her head, and continued scrubbing clothes. Xu Qi’an tilted his head back, staring at the azure sky in a daze—only to get splashed in the face with dirty, soapy water.

The culprit clutched her stomach, laughing uncontrollably.

Xu Qi’an glared at her viciously, but she wasn’t the least bit afraid. Hands on her hips, she lifted her chin in defiance.

Unknowingly, dusk arrived. Xu Qi’an and the Princess Consort worked together to prepare a meal that was barely edible.

After dinner, he tested the waters: "It’s curfew… I, uh, I won’t be leaving tonight?"

The Princess Consort didn’t answer, focusing on clearing the dishes.

"Eh?" Xu Qi’an called out.

"Stay if you want, why ask me? I’m just a weak woman, how could I possibly chase you out?" she snapped back.

Her expression perfectly conveyed helpless resignation.

…

Jianzhou. A manor nestled against mountains and water, with pavilions, bridges, and flowing streams.

The lofts were exquisitely built, with rock gardens, flowering trees, and lush greenery adding to the picturesque scenery.

In the manor’s inner courtyard, a pool exuded a chilling mist. From within the pool, a nine-coloured flower bud grew—red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, violet, gold, and white...

Under the night sky, Daoist Jinlian strolled to the poolside. His daoist robe was faded from frequent washing, his hair a mix of black and white, slightly dishevelled. His gaze was gentle yet bright as he silently observed the flower bud in the pool.

This manor once belonged to a wealthy merchant of Jianzhou. Years ago, when the merchant fell on hard times and was pursued by bandits, he was saved by a Daoist of the Earth Sect. In gratitude, he gifted this manor to the Daoist.

Since then, the manor had become a secret base for the Earth Sect’s benevolent faction—and the headquarters of the Heaven and Earth Society.

The manor housed thirty-six Earth Sect Daoists. Apart from Jinlian, there was also a Daoist Bailian, a Rank Four expert. The remaining disciples varied in cultivation levels.

Daoist Jinlian led these disciples in retreating here, lying low while secretly strengthening their forces. They swapped their daoist robes for servant garb, took up farming tools, and outwardly played the role of mere manor workers—while in truth, they bore the weight of their sect’s survival.

He had carefully chosen this place as their stronghold. Jianzhou was the martial arts stronghold of Great Feng, the only province with a recognised "wulin alliance leader."

The other twelve provinces had numerous sects and gangs, scattered like loose sand. But Jianzhou’s entire martial world functioned as a unified whole.

The organisation that ruled Jianzhou’s jianghu was none other than the Wulin Alliance.

Even the local government had to treat the Wulin Alliance with respect, and the imperial court acknowledged its standing. Of course, the Wulin Alliance was not an outlaw sect that defied authority.

On the contrary, its existence greatly stabilised Jianzhou’s jianghu, ensuring that "jianghu matters are settled within the jianghu."

Daoist Jinlian chose this as his base precisely because of its structured order and the presence of a powerful martial organisation that could restrain the influence of the Earth Sect’s demon Daoists.

At that moment, the pool water suddenly began to boil. Bubbles gurgled up, and misty cold air rose like drifting smoke.

The nine-coloured flower bud came alive. One by one, the colours—red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, violet, gold, and white—lit up in succession, glowing like a rhythmic breath.

After dozens of pulses, the flower bud shuddered, releasing a brilliant pillar of light hundreds of metres high, illuminating the night sky. Even those dozens of miles away only had to look up to see the resplendent glow.

"Whenever the Nine-Coloured Golden Lotus nears maturity, it will emit such light. There's no concealing it."

At that moment, a gentle woman clad in a plain long dress, styled as a married lady, walked gracefully to Daoist Jinlian’s side. She stood beside him, gazing at the slowly fading radiance in the night sky.

"Heilian will surely notice. There's no hiding it. Sect Master, have you found suitable allies?" she asked worriedly.

Daoist Jinlian chuckled and asked in return, "Who do you think is a suitable ally?"

The woman, whose daoist title was Bailian, softly replied, "Naturally, the Daoist Leader of the Human Sect—Luo Yuheng."

Daoist Jinlian shook his head. "She’s afraid of Heilian’s karmic fire and will not oppose him. The Nine-Coloured Lotus alone is not worth her risking her life. And I currently lack anything that would truly tempt her."

*Unless I offer Xu Qi’an to her bed…* Daoist Jinlian thought mockingly. However, Luo Yuheng was extremely selective about her dual cultivation partner. She was still observing Xu Qi’an and had yet to make a decision.

Bailian pondered for a moment. Seeing her sect master’s composed expression, as if he had things well in hand, she raised an elegant brow.

"Are you thinking of mobilising the Heaven and Earth Society? But didn’t you say that until they had fully matured and we had absolute confidence in eliminating Heilian, you wouldn’t expose their identities?"

"Their growth has far exceeded my expectations," Daoist Jinlian explained.

"Who are ‘they’?" Bailian blinked curiously.

"You’ll know once they arrive in Jianzhou," Daoist Jinlian said with a mysterious smile.

…

A distant immortal mountain, an ancient daoist temple.

Within a quiet chamber, an oil lamp flickered on a wooden desk. Silhouettes sat cross-legged around the flame, their faces half-bathed in its orange glow, half shrouded in shadow.

The fire cast their twisted, claw-like shadows on the walls, dancing like eerie spectres.

"The Nine-Coloured Lotus Seed is about to mature…"

A deep voice echoed from the void, reverberating in the silent chamber.

The figures around the candle whispered among themselves.

"Kill them all, take back the Nine-Coloured Lotus Seed."

"Capture Bailian and drain her essence."

"I’ve desired her body for many years now…"

"It’s been ages since we last slaughtered. I can’t wait to feast on human blood…"

"Jianzhou has the Wulin Alliance, which is a hassle. But that only makes it more interesting, hehe…"

Their words dripped with depravity, their voices as chilling as demons conspiring in the dark.

The deep voice from the void spoke again: "It could also be a trap. That mysterious expert in Chuzhou was Jinlian’s ally, waiting for me to walk into his net."

The murmurs instantly ceased. The shadows around the flame seemed to grow cautious, restraining their madness.

The deep voice continued, "Spread the news. The Wulin Alliance will be interested. The lotus seed will mature in half a month—surely, experts from other provinces will come."

Then, it let out a sinister cackle.

"That includes the Emperor of the Great Feng."

…

In the eastern wing, Xu Qi’an blew out the candle and lay down, ready to sleep.

Suddenly, that familiar lurch struck him—someone was communicating via the Earth Book fragment.

He immediately sat up, relit the candle, and took out the fragment to check the message:

【NINE: Everyone, in half a month, the Nine-Coloured Lotus Seed will mature. Are you ready?】
