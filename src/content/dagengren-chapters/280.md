# 280. A Poem

Following the Yulin Guard to Dexin Pavilion, Xu Qi'an was informed that Princess Huaiqing had just finished her sword practice and was currently bathing, so he had to wait outside.

*Heh, did she hear I was coming and deliberately decided to take a bath…* Xu Qi'an's thoughts ran wild.

After waiting outside Dexin Pavilion for about half an hour, a young maid in a pale yellow palace gown stepped over the threshold and softly said, "Sir Xu, Her Highness will see you now."

Upon entering the elegant courtyard, he saw Princess Huaiqing in the reception hall. Having just bathed, her exquisitely beautiful face was tinged with a light flush, and her eyes sparkled brightly.

There was a new, softer allure about her, less of the lofty coldness she usually exuded.

It was like a jade statue of a beauty had suddenly come to life.

*This is what true feminine charm looks like,* Xu Qi'an thought. *Keeping up the icy, noble princess act every day isn't cute at all…* He cupped his hands in greeting: "Your humble servant greets Your Highness."

Huaiqing motioned for the maid to serve tea, her voice as clear and cold as ever, "What brings you here, Sir Xu?"

"My cousin has just passed the metropolitan exam, but he hails from Cloud Deer Academy. I am concerned for his future prospects," Xu Qi'an earnestly explained. "Does Your Highness have any wise counsel?"

If there's a problem I can’t figure out, asking a clever person is the best course of action. *One must learn to use every tool at their disposal. If the princess has no ideas, I’ll ask Wei Yuan.*

Huaiqing’s gaze flickered, and she sipped her tea thoughtfully. She immediately grasped Xu Qi'an’s meaning—he didn’t want his cousin to be branded as part of the Eunuch Clique.

Clever people never put all their eggs in one basket.

*Xu Ningyan may be a martial artist, but he’s incredibly sharp…* Huaiqing smiled faintly. "You’ve been to Qingzhou—how well do you know the situation there?"

"The governance is clear, and Ziyang Jushi has managed Qingzhou meticulously…”

As he spoke, Xu Qi'an suddenly understood Huaiqing’s point. With Ziyang Jushi holding supreme authority in Qingzhou, any Cloud Deer Academy scholar sent there would have ample room to showcase their talents without fear of being suppressed.

"Qingzhou is a safe haven Ziyang Jushi has carved out for his Confucian scholars," the Princess explained without further pretence.

*But I only have this one precious little brother. I don't want to send him off to a faraway place like Qingzhou…* Xu Qi'an sighed inwardly. "I understand, Your Highness."

*Fine, I'll have him stay in the capital for now and figure something out later. Who knows, maybe he'll find his own backer.*

"By the way, does Your Highness enjoy reading novels?" Xu Qi'an’s true intent finally emerged.

"I’ve never been interested in such things."

The princess’s haughty tone was akin to a top scholar saying: *Web novels? Hah, I don’t read that kind of thing!*

"I happened to come across an interesting book. If Your Highness ever has some free time, perhaps you might find it enjoyable… But please, keep it secret." Xu Qi'an pulled out _Domineering Lady Empress Falls for Me_ and placed it on the table.

Huaiqing didn't even glance at it, offering only a polite nod.

After Xu Qi'an left, Huaiqing was about to instruct the maid to put the novel away, but as her eyes fell on the cover, she suddenly froze.

_Domineering Lady Empress Falls for Me_… Lady Empress?!

*Such a scandalous title…* Huaiqing’s interest was piqued, and since she had nothing pressing to do, she figured a brief glance wouldn't hurt.

She sat down again, opening the outrageously titled novel.

The story told of a scholar who, by accident, ended up in the demon realm. Though brilliant and full of literary talent, the demons intended to eat him, preparing to fry him in oil.

At that moment, the Empress appeared—the only well-read figure in the demon realm, known for her vast intelligence and knowledge. She saved the scholar and kept him in her harem, where they exchanged poems and discussed the classics.

Throughout, the Empress maintained a cold and domineering attitude, though deep down, she cared for the scholar. Her favourite phrase was: "You’re playing with fire."

Huaiqing had never encountered such an amusing novel before. It lacked any real depth or intellectual value, utterly unlike the complex, abstruse works she usually preferred.

Yet somehow, this simple, day-to-day story carried a strange charm.

Huaiqing found herself compelled to see how the Empress’s “public shows of dominance” would play out next.

Yes, public shows of dominance—that was it.

Despite her cold and ruthless façade, the Empress harboured a tender heart. The scholar, on the other hand, doted on her, always considerate of her feelings. He would even get jealous when she drank with the demon generals.

Before she knew it, dusk had fallen—she’d been reading for over two hours.

Huaiqing also realized another benefit of this novel: it required no brainpower.

It was pure entertainment.

When she finished, however, a wave of anger surged within her. *What was I doing?*

*Reading a book devoid of intellectual nourishment for two whole hours?! Wasn't that just a waste of life? How could I squander my time on something so frivolous and vapid?*

She felt a deep sense of guilt.

"Just a trivial read…" Huaiqing muttered dismissively, tossing the book aside as she got up to leave the reception hall. But a few minutes later, she returned, tucked the book into her sleeve, and took it with her.

It definitely wasn’t because she planned to review it again before bed, but rather because such a book could not be seen by others. It was like a secret novel for the boudoir—unfit for public view.

…

At the same time, in Shaoyin Pavilion, Lin’an was fully engrossed in *Great Sage of Love*.

"So… this is what romance between men and women is like… Ah, how could running dog give me such a book?"

Lin'an rolled around on her bed, her face flushed red. Reading the 5,000-word scene where Zixia Celestial and Long Aotian shared an intimate moment, she blushed furiously, muttering, "How awful, how terrible…"

Yet she read every word, carefully visualizing the entire scene in her mind.

She felt her body heat up, her legs occasionally rubbing against each other. Her round, tender face blushed like a ripe apple, and her alluring peach blossom eyes—already captivating—grew hazy with a soft, seductive mist.

But the bedroom activities were only a part of the story. At its core, it was the tale of Zixia Celestial and Long Aotian’s love.

The first two-thirds were sweet and tender, but the last third… a knife to the heart.

When Long Aotian was skinned alive, his bones pulled out, and he was condemned to be reincarnated as a beast forever, while Zixia Celestial was imprisoned in the Palace of Eternal Cold, Lin’an realized her pillow was soaked with tears.

Sniffling, she grumbled, "Why isn’t there any more? Running dog, why isn’t there any more?"

After venting her frustration, she summoned her maids and said, "Prepare hot water, we wish to bathe."

"Now? But it’s almost time for dinner…" the maid asked, confused.

Lin'an's cheeks flushed even deeper. "Do what we say!"

Soon, the water was heated, and the maids prepared the bath. Lin'an slipped her delicate body into the warm water, which was scattered with flower petals, her smooth shoulders and elegant collarbones peeking above the surface.

"Tell me," she suddenly asked, "among the guards at my side, who do you think is the most handsome, the most talented, and the most loyal to me?"

"They’re all very loyal, Your Highness. As for who’s the most talented or interesting, I’m not sure… But if it doesn’t have to be a guard, I think I have someone in mind."

"Who?!" Lin'an immediately perked up.

"Sir Xu, of course! Sir Xu is handsome, talented, and always makes you laugh. He’s not a guard, but you’ve recruited him as a close confidant. And though he’s a Nightwatcher, not a scholar, he could still be considered a sort of protector, right?"

Lin’an bit her lip and gently stirred the petals. The water rippled, casting a blurry reflection of her face—delicate, rosy, and shy.

…

The Imperial City, Wang Manor!

Golden-red sunset streamed through the latticed windows of Prime Minister Wang’s study. The fifty-something Wang Zhenwen finished reviewing his dossiers and swept them aside into a corner.

He then laid out a piece of paper, pressed it with a paperweight, and picked up a brush to begin writing... At that moment, the eldest daughter Miss Wang entered, carrying a bowl of goji and ginseng soup.

Wang Zhenwen ignored her and, riding the surge of inspiration swelling in his chest, began to write.

_"Clear wine in golden goblets, ten thousand cash a cup,_     
_Delicacies on jade platters, a myriad silver more...."_

*"Oh, the road is hard! The road is hard!*     
*Crossroads abound; which to choose?,*    
*When the winds are high and the waves are tall,*     
_I’ll hoist my sails over the ocean blue."_

Miss Wang placed the soup down and leaned over to take a look. She couldn't move her gaze for a long time, murmuring, “Father, you’ve penned a masterpiece destined for the ages.

"When this poem is published, it will surely shake the court."

As a literature enthusiast, her appreciation skills were still sharp. Miss Wang was utterly captivated by the grandeur of this poem.

Wang Zhenwen shook his head, took a sip of the ginseng soup, and exhaled contentedly. “This was not written by me. It was composed by the new _huiyuan_. Didn’t you visit the examination halls today? Didn’t you see him?

"They say he’s quite the striking figure, a rare handsome young man."

"I didn't meet him. I was just mingling in the crowd," Miss Wang denied quickly, her eyes flickering toward the desk.

"When I reinstated poetry into the civil examinations years ago, it took no small effort. The opposition was fierce," Wang Zhenwen tapped the paper with his fingers, his smile broad. "Now that such a fine work has emerged, I can finally hold my head high. It’s a vindication for the scholars of the world, and for our ancestors. We didn’t let the treasure of poetry fade into oblivion."

After the publishing of the Plum List, Xu Xinnian’s poem *Ode to the Difficult Road* quickly spread among the examiners, who praised it with enthusiasm, calling it stirring and inspiring. In a few more days, after it had time to percolate, this poem would be sung and celebrated throughout the capital.

"I heard that this huiyuan is a scholar of the Cloud Deer Academy," Miss Wang said "offhandedly."

Wang Zhenwen paused for a moment, then sighed. "What a pity."

The civil servants of the court were dismissive of the scholars from the Cloud Deer Academy. As the head of the civil officials, the Prime Minister could not relent on this stance.

The more talented Xu Xinnian was, the more wary Wang Zhenwen became—and the less likely he would make use of him.

"Dad!"

As Miss Wang helped gather the memorials, she said, "I would like to host a literary gathering at our residence and invite some of the well-known scholars of the capital. Under your name, of course."

The organizer of a literary gathering must be someone of high status and reputation, something Miss Wang didn’t have on her own. However, she had organized many gatherings in the past, all under Wang Zhenwen’s name.

With the spring exams just over, it was the perfect time to hold such an event.

Wang Zhenwen nodded. "Very well."

…

Qingyun Mountain, Cloud Deer Academy.

As the last rays of sunlight lingered, a rider sped down the main road, raising clouds of dust.

The horse stopped at the foot of the mountain, and a student in a scholar's robe leapt off, holding a list in his hand, and sprinted toward the peak.

"Good news, good news!"

He shouted as he ran, soon reaching the academy.

Along the way, several students heard the commotion and came out to ask what was going on, but the messenger ignored them all, heading straight for Great Scholar Zhang Shen's study.

Hearing the noise, Zhang Shen was already waiting outside, his face composed as he watched the approaching student.

"A scholar must maintain a calm mind. Neither great joy nor great sorrow should sway one’s heart."

After this gentle reminder, Zhang Shen smiled. "Judging by your excitement, I assume all our students passed the exams."

"Sir, not only did they pass," the student exclaimed, "Xu Xinnian placed first as the huiyuan."

Zhang Shen thought he had misheard and asked sternly, "The huiyuan?!"

The student nodded emphatically. "The huiyuan, it’s true! I have the names of the academy's students from the Plum List—Xu Xinnian is at the top, without a doubt."

Zhang Shen snatched the list and looked it over. He saw the list of candidates, with their academies and backgrounds, ranked in order.

At the top: Xu Cijiu, first place, huiyuan.

Zhang Shen stared at the list for a long moment, then suddenly let out a loud cry: "Dean, Chen Tai, Li Mubai... My student got the huiyuan, my student got the huiyuan!"

The messenger was dumbfounded.

Soon enough, Dean Zhao Shou and two other Great Scholars, Li Mubai and Chen Tai, arrived on the scene, appearing at Zhang Shen’s study by sheer force of bullshit will, despite the distance.

The elderly, scruffy Dean Zhao Shou was the first to ask, "Is it true? Which student placed first?"

"Xu Cijiu!" Zhang Shen declared proudly.

Zhao Shou frowned, pondering for a moment, then remembered. "Ah, the student who’s never lost an argument?"

"...This shows his eloquence is unmatched," Zhang Shen replied.

"Congratulations, congratulations!" Li Mubai and Chen Tai, though genuinely pleased, couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy.

It was only natural for all the scholars at Cloud Deer Academy to celebrate when one of their own became the huiyuan, and the teachers would be no exception. In fact, they might even dance and drink the night away.

Yet their envy lingered, as Xu Cijiu was Zhang Shen’s student.

Zhao Shou frowned again. "In theory, he shouldn’t have won first place. What kind of essay did Xu Cijiu write?"

Based on previous exams, there was certainly cheating going on this year. As a scholar from the Cloud Deer Academy, Xu Cijiu wouldn’t have had the chance to cheat.

Yet to think he won purely by merit seemed a bit far-fetched.

Zhang Shen, having calmed down somewhat, admitted, "Xu Cijiu's essays were excellent, but to call them extraordinary might be an overstatement."

Yet how could a merely “excellent” essay have won over two of the three examiners?

Just moments ago, when the student brought the news, even Zhang Shen had doubted it.

Li Mubai, noticing the messenger still present, waved him over and asked, "What other news from the capital?"

It was a casual question, but the messenger quickly nodded. "There is indeed more, sir. After copying the Plum List, I found Xu Xinnian's achievement rather unusual, so I invited one of the examiners for a meal.

"The ‘meal cost’ came to fifteen taels, which I’ll be expensing from the academy."

The Great Scholars nodded approvingly. Cloud Deer Academy students were resourceful and capable, not rigid or overly conservative.

The messenger continued and took out a slip of paper from his robe. "The examiner said that Xu Xinnian composed a poem during the third session, which deeply impressed the Grand Scholar of the Eastern Pavilion. The other examiners were also convinced, and since his previous exam scores were outstanding, that’s how he became the huiyuan."

"A poem?"

The Great Scholars exchanged glances.
