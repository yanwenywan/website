# 418. Truth or Dare

Tianji and Tianshu exchanged a glance and knelt down together. "Your Majesty, forgive us. We failed to seize the lotus seed."

The smile on Emperor Yuanjing’s face gradually disappeared, darkening as he slowly said,

"Twenty cannons, twenty-six top experts, and you two fourth ranks, working together with the Daoists of the Earth Sect. We shall give you a chance to explain yourselves. If there was truly some unavoidable reason, We may pardon you."

Tianji turned his head to glance at his companion and said in a low voice, "Your Majesty, this time Jianzhou was in turmoil. Besides us and the Earth Sect, almost the entire Wulin Alliance dispatched their top experts to fight over the lotus seed."

Emperor Yuanjing’s expression remained blank. "So, you were defeated by the Wulin Alliance?"

Tianji felt a chill and hurriedly said, "Not the Wulin Alliance. It was the faction of Earth Sect Daoists who were hiding the Nine-Coloured Lotus. They invited some helpers—Heaven Sect’s Holy Maiden Li Miaozhen, former Silver Gong Xu Qi’an, Human Sect’s honorary disciple Chu Yuanzhen, the Sitianjian’s Yang Qianhuan, a monk, and a little girl from the Strength Gu Tribe of the Southern Marches…"

Tianshu, who remained silent, keenly sensed that when His Majesty heard the name "Xu Qi’an," his breath quickened slightly.

She didn’t dare lift her head to peek at the emperor’s face, but she could easily guess that his expression was definitely not looking good.

Emperor Yuanjing’s expression was more than just bad—it was as dark as a stormy sea. The veins on his forehead bulged slightly as he struggled to contain his anger.

"Who would have thought… A once insignificant nobody has now become a dog that knows how to bite."

Emperor Yuanjing’s cold laugh squeezed out from between his teeth. "We just issued a self-reproach edict, thinking to settle accounts with him once the storm passed. The Xu family’s entire clan is in the capital. Let’s see how We’ll deal with him."

After a pause, he said, "Continue."

Tianji reported everything he had witnessed in full detail, including the conflict between that mysterious young master and Xu Qi’an. Naturally, his interpretation was that the mysterious young master was a direct heir of some faction who, jealous of Xu Qi’an’s reputation, deliberately targeted him to build his own fame.

It made sense.

"How did Xu Qi’an end up mixed up with the Earth Sect Daoists?" Emperor Yuanjing suddenly asked.

"Your servant has not yet had the chance to investigate." Tianji replied. Seeing that Emperor Yuanjing had fallen silent again, he skipped over this topic and continued.

Emperor Yuanjing listened quietly until Tianji mentioned that Xu Qi’an had thrown out a protective talisman and shouted, "Master, save me!"—and that the National Teacher had really descended in golden light to rescue him.

The old emperor’s expression suddenly changed.

"How did the National Teacher get involved? How could he summon her? Why would the National Teacher respond to his call…"

Emperor Yuanjing paced back and forth in the imperial study, his expression shifting between ferocity and gloom.

*The National Teacher—why would she respond to Xu Qi’an’s plea for help? When did they become connected?*

A difficult-to-describe emotion surged up from his heart. Emperor Yuanjing’s face suddenly twisted, and an impulse flashed through his mind, to immediately eliminate Xu Qi’an, to beat to death this vicious dog who knew how to bite.

Forget the self-reproach edict, forget the ministers’ opinions, forget how the world would see it…

It wasn’t because he feared Xu Qi’an’s growth rate. Emperor Yuanjing had seen many gifted prodigies before—wasn’t Chu Yuanzhen one as well? He didn’t even bother to pay attention to him.

It was because Xu Qi’an had called for the National Teacher’s help—and the National Teacher had answered!

"Prepare the carriage to Lingbao Temple!" Emperor Yuanjing said, word by word.

…

The Tower of Noble Spirit.

Xu Qi’an was dressed in azure silk robes embroidered with pale blue swirling cloud patterns. His sash jingled with decorative jade pendants, and his hair was tied with a hollowed-out gold crown. He wore cloud-patterned boots.

At first glance, he looked more regal than a prince. His tall figure, handsome features, and deep-set eyes, combined with the playful charm in his brows, created a unique aura—part aristocratic young master, part roguish street youth.

Wei Yuan gazed at the young man sitting across from him, looking somewhat dazed. He smiled and said, "I’ve grown used to seeing you in Nightwatcher uniform. Seeing you like this is rather refreshing."

"My sister made it for me—stitched every thread by hand."

Xu Qi’an cradled his teacup, recalling the obsessed expression on Xu Lingyue’s face at the time, and smiled. "Duke Wei, if I were to use this look to woo Princess Huaiqing, do you think I’d have a chance?"

Wei Yuan looked at him calmly, his deep eyes showing the passage of countless years. "That’s not how you usually talk. Out with it—what’s on your mind?"

"When investigating the Consort Fu case, I learned from the Imperial Uncle that Duke Wei and the Empress were childhood sweethearts. If I were to marry Huaiqing, Duke Wei, you’d surely treat me like a son-in-law, wouldn’t you?"

Xu Qi’an chuckled. "Duke Wei has treated me exceedingly well—your kindness is as deep as a mountain. No blood ties, yet you’ve nurtured me so carefully—all because of those Three Trials of the Heart…"

Wei Yuan’s expression remained warm. "It seems you gained something extra on this trip to Jianzhou."

Xu Qi’an put down his cup, pulled out three dice from his sleeve, and placed them on the table. He said softly,

"In my hometown… well, back when I was working as a constable in Changle County, I learned a drinking game from some street thugs. It’s called Truth or Dare.

"We roll the dice. Whoever gets the lowest score must either answer a question or drink a cup of wine. I’d like to play this with Duke Wei—but no drinking, just truth-telling."

He gazed calmly at the man in green robes. "If Duke Wei is unwilling, then I’ll leave immediately—and never bother you again."

This time, there was no smile on Wei Yuan’s face. He stared at Xu Qi’an for a long, long time.

"Are you certain?"

"Yes."

Wei Yuan nodded, raised his hand hidden in his sleeve, and gestured for him to proceed.

Xu Qi’an let out a breath of relief but couldn’t stop his heart from racing.

He picked up his teacup, shook it slightly, and rolled the three dice inside. The dice clinked as they spun and settled under the overturned cup.

Lifting the cup—triple sixes!

*Knew it! With my fortune, I’m unbeatable with dice—especially since the jade pendant the Jianzheng gave me cracked and my fortune is leaking out…* Xu Qi’an thought smugly.

Wei Yuan picked up his teacup, shook it briefly, and overturned it on the table. Without hesitation, he lifted it:

Two, five, six.

Wei Yuan smiled warmly. "What do you want to ask?"

Xu Qi’an hesitated and then said, "What exactly is the relationship between you and the Empress?"

This wasn’t mere gossip. Wei Yuan and the Empress’s relationship determined the depth of any rift between Wei Yuan and Emperor Yuanjing.

Moreover, Consort Chen—Lin’an’s birth mother—was a plant placed by the mysterious Arcanist. If the Empress and Wei Yuan were truly close, the mysterious Arcanist might try to manipulate the Empress to frame Wei Yuan.

Finally, Xu Qi’an’s lsp instincts told him that Wei Yuan and the Empress’s relationship wasn’t simple.

"You know quite a bit."

Wei Yuan’s gentle expression faded. His weathered, time-worn eyes sharpened as he stared at Xu Qi’an for a moment before saying,

"I’ll tell you about my relationship with the Empress someday—but not now. Heh, you never said it had to be right now."

*That’s a cheap loophole to exploit…* Xu Qi’an nodded. "Alright."

Wei Yuan’s words were essentially an indirect admission that his relationship with the Empress was not ordinary—which counted as an answer in its own right.

In the second round, Xu Qi’an rolled 666, while Wei Yuan rolled a 551.

Xu Qi’an lowered his gaze to the dice in front of Wei Yuan, paused briefly, and then slowly raised his eyes to look at him.

"Duke Wei, do you know what secret was hidden behind the Battle of Shanhai Pass?"

Wei Yuan said calmly, "If you mean the theft of Great Feng’s fortune, then yes—I know."

*He really knows about the theft of Great Feng’s fortune…* Just as shock surged through Xu Qi’an’s heart, he forcibly suppressed it, keeping his expression calm and composed.

Wei Yuan’s gaze lowered slightly.

"Every time war breaks out, it shakes a nation’s fortune. If the war is won, the nation’s fortune grows; if it’s lost, the nation’s fortune is diminished.

"The larger the scale of the conflict, the greater the disturbance to the nation’s fortune.

"In the middle ages of the Great Zhou, when the vassal princes rebelled and the rebel forces reached the Zhou capital, the historical records say that public morale wavered and the scholar-official class was gripped with fear and anxiety.

"Although the rebellion was eventually quelled, it became the turning point in Great Zhou’s decline.

"The Battle of Shanhai Pass involved multiple nations and factions, with over a million troops engaged in the fighting. Such a large-scale conflict is rarely seen in the historical records. The disturbance to the nation’s fortune was likely far greater than when Emperor Wuzong purged the court.

"If one wished to steal a nation’s fortune, the Battle of Shanhai Pass was the perfect opportunity. Unfortunately I only realised this afterwards."

The ‘over a million troops’ Wei Yuan referred to were true elite soldiers—not including militia and conscripts. Historical records often mention "an army of a hundred thousand marching to war" or "three hundred thousand troops dispatched"—but those numbers were inflated, including militia and logistical personnel.

The actual number of soldiers who fought on the battlefield was often less than a third of the total figure.

But in the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the forces committed by Great Feng, the Buddhist Kingdoms, the northern and southern barbarians, the Yao tribes, and the Church of the Warlock God—those who truly fought on the battlefield—exceeded a million.

*So that’s how it is, no wonder the first Jianzheng and the previous leader of the Heaven Gu Tribe plotted such a massive war. It was to shake the foundation of the Central Plains’ orthodox dynasty and steal the Great Feng’s fortune…*

Understanding dawned upon Xu Qi’an.

Although he knew that Great Feng’s fortune had been stolen during the Battle of Shanhai Pass, he had never understood the underlying mechanism.

The third round.

Xu Qi’an’s luck was off the charts—he rolled 666 once again.

But this time, when Wei Yuan lifted his teacup, he revealed… 666.

"Rare indeed!"

Wei Yuan smiled. "Why don’t we each ask a question?"

Xu Qi’an nodded in agreement and spoke first.

"Duke Wei, do you know who stole the Great Feng’s fortune—and why?"

Wei Yuan shook his head.

"Among the major systems, only Arcanists and Confucians are closely tied to fortune. The Human Sect can be counted as half a connection.

"But the ability to shift a nation’s fortune lies only with the Arcanists and Confucians.

"The highest-ranked figure in the current Confucian system is Zhao Shou, the Dean of Cloud Deer Academy. If he wished to shake the Great Feng’s fortune, he would be lacking in ability. That leaves only the Arcanists.

"Arcanists can conceal heaven’s secrets. How could I possibly know who it was? Even if I knew, I would have long since… 'forgotten.'"

Xu Qi’an took a deep breath.

"It was the first Jianzheng."

After speaking, he fixed his gaze on Wei Yuan, waiting for a visible reaction—a change in expression, a shift in demeanour.

Sure enough, Wei Yuan’s gaze suddenly darkened. His fingers, resting on the table, trembled slightly.

He stared hard at Xu Qi’an, his body involuntarily leaning forward. His tone became slightly strained. "Be clear—what do you know? What information have you uncovered?"

Xu Qi’an said, "Duke Wei, is that your question?"

Unexpectedly, Wei Yuan shook his head.

He composed himself, returning to his usual calm and unruffled manner.

Wei Yuan smiled faintly and asked, "My question is this: The sealed object beneath Sangpo Lake—is it inside you?"

A bolt form the blue.

…

Lingbao Temple

Emperor Yuanjing sat in a familiar meditation chamber, facing a flawless beauty.

Luo Yuheng was one of the most captivating women he had ever seen. No matter how his tastes shifted over the years, Luo Yuheng’s beauty always satisfied him. He never grew tired of looking at her. 

In Emperor Yuanjing’s heart, this woman—despite never agreeing to dual cultivation with him—was already his possession. What’s more, his long-cherished dream of immortality depended on her.

Therefore, any man who grew too close to Luo Yuheng was unacceptable.

She could disregard him, she could be cold and dismissive—that was fine. But if she showed favour to another man, especially a particular concern:

There would only be death for him.

Emperor Yuanjing was filled with murderous intent toward Xu Qi’an. Even though the fallout from the self-reproach edict had not yet settled, he had countless ways to target Xu Qi’an.

Would it be difficult for an emperor to kill a commoner?

Not at all.

Previously, he had ignored Xu Qi’an, allowing him to run amok—because Emperor Yuanjing had never regarded him as a threat.

His true enemies were the court ministers, the Jianzheng, and Zhao Shou.

Xu Qi’an was merely a pawn in the storm—a disposable piece.

Even now, he didn’t consider Xu Qi’an an enemy. He had simply planned to settle accounts once the chaos subsided.

But he hadn’t expected this mad dog to bite off more than he could chew.

Now, even if it cost him something—he would kill the dog.

Emperor Yuanjing gazed at the National Teacher with dark eyes and said in a low voice,

"We’ve heard from King Huai’s spies that the National Teacher intervened in the Jianzhou affair?"

The beautiful Luo Yuheng, as flawless as white jade, nodded slightly.

"Why did the National Teacher interfere?" Emperor Yuanjing pressed.

"The Nine-Coloured Lotus is a Daoist treasure. How could we allow outsiders to covet it?" Luo Yuheng’s red lips parted, her tone icy. "Why, however, did Your Majesty seek to take the lotus seed?"

Emperor Yuanjing restrained his temper and explained, "Our aptitude in Daoist cultivation is lacking. We have long struggled to form a golden core. Upon hearing that the Nine-Coloured Lotus Seed could awaken enlightenment, we sought to claim it."

Luo Yuheng nodded, appearing satisfied with the explanation.

Suddenly, Emperor Yuanjing smiled—a calm, almost casual smile.

"We heard that Xu Qi’an burned a talisman to summon the National Teacher. Heh, We have high regard for him—talented, ambitious, with a sense of justice. He’s young, though, and lacks an understanding of the greater picture.

"He still requires some years of refinement. This time, we shall strip him of his titles and demote him to commoner, this should temper his spirit well. However, We truly didn’t expect that he and the National Teacher would have such a close relationship."

Luo Yuheng’s brow furrowed. Her tone was cold. "A mere commoner—how could he have any connection to Us?"

Emperor Yuanjing’s gaze sharpened. "If that’s the case, why did the National Teacher accept his summons?"
