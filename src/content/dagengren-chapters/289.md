# 289. Borrow Someone 

*Why would such a powerful Buddhist sect choose to seal its own traitor in the Great Feng? The reason either lies in some special property of Sangpo Lake or in Shenshu himself...*

Xu Qi'an hesitated slightly before voicing his doubt.

"I am just an ordinary man, and know nothing of such secrets," Wei Yuan shook his head, indicating his lack of knowledge.

"Xu Ningyan, you're twenty this year, correct?" Wei Yuan suddenly asked.

"Yes, Duke Wei," Xu Qi'an was puzzled, feeling a strange sense of déjà vu from this line of questioning.

As expected, Wei Yuan followed up by saying, "It's about time for you to start a family."

In this world, people generally lived long lives unless afflicted by natural disasters or accidents, easily living past sixty. Seventy or eighty was not uncommon. Therefore, the marriageable age range was broad. Some girls married as early as fourteen, their bodies not yet fully developed, which led to some awkward scenes. On the other hand, some women remained unmarried into their twenties, untouched by suitors, and equally pitiful in their own way.

Xu Qi'an had seen both cases first-hand. His aunt married his uncle at sixteen, while Princess Huaiqing, already twenty-five, was still single. Reflecting on the question of lifespan, Xu Qi'an couldn’t help but wonder why the Confucian Sage passed away at 82, which seemed a bit premature for such a remarkable figure.

However, Wei Yuan was a frail little bird, and discussing such high-level matters with him felt unnecessary and pointless.

Xu Qi'an tentatively asked, "What are you suggesting, Duke Wei?"

"The Right Censor-in-Chief has a granddaughter who has also reached the age of marriage. She is quite beautiful," Wei Yuan said.

"Quite beautiful… I fear she might not be a suitable match for me," Xu Qi'an shook his head.

"The fourth daughter of the Marquis of Weihai, aged seventeen, is also looking for a husband. You're a viscount, so the match would be fitting," Wei Yuan suggested.

"Your subordinate does not wish to boast, but a mere daughter of a marquis is hardly a suitable match for me," Xu Qi'an declined once again.

"How about the niece of the Grand Commissioner of Canal Transport? I'm in need of funds, and if you marry into his family, it would solve my financial woes," Wei Yuan remarked, looking at him.

*Wait a moment, I joke about being a eunuch’s son, but you’re not actually my father! The desire for a political marriage is too obvious here...* Xu Qi'an considered for a moment and asked, "Is she beautiful?"

"Naturally, she is quite lovely," Wei Yuan replied.

Upon hearing the phrase "quite lovely," Xu Qi'an immediately hit pass, shaking his head, "To be honest, Duke Wei, I’ve saved up quite a bit of silver. My plan is to redeem the oirans from the Jiaofangsi. If my wife is merely lovely, she won’t be able to keep those beauties in line."

Wei Yuan frowned slightly, "What kind of woman do you seek, then? Or perhaps... have you already set your sights on someone?"

*Set my sights? That’s an understatement...* Xu Qi'an pondered briefly and replied, "First and foremost, she must be stunningly beautiful. Secondly, her status must be noble. Lastly, she must possess considerable talent, someone who can be both a capable lady of the house and a skilled hostess."

Wei Yuan chuckled, "Perhaps I should petition the emperor on your behalf to arrange a marriage with a princess."

Xu Qi'an was suddenly excited, "Duke Wei, are you serious?"

Wei Yuan nodded and gestured toward the door.

"What orders do you have, Duke Wei?"

"Out."

…

After being kicked out of the Tower of Noble Spirit by Wei Yuan, Xu Qi'an didn’t return to his One Blade Hall but instead made his way to the newly rebuilt Spring Breeze Hall.

Li Yuchun was about to lead Song Tingfeng, Zhu Guangxiao, and several Bronze Gongs on a patrol. The commotion caused by the Buddhist monks last night was still a hot topic, and the citizens of the capital were abuzz with discussion this morning.

Some marvelled at the power of the Buddhist monks, while others expressed outrage at the religion’s audacity, calling for the court to take action and wage war.

From nobles to commoners, everyone was talking about it.

If there were an internet in this era, millions of the Great Feng’s citizens would be shouting: *Bring me my sword!* — ready to fight the Western Region’s Buddhists with their keyboards.

To prevent troublemakers from taking advantage of the chaos or spreading rumours, the constabulary had increased their patrols.

"Yoku yoku!"

Xu Qi'an intercepted Li Yuchun and the others, returned to One Blade Hall to gather his own team of Bronze Gongs, and led a dozen men, all walking with arrogant swagger, to patrol the streets together.

After about half an hour, as they passed by a Goulan, Xu Qi'an said, "Boss, you take my men and patrol over there. I’ll take Tingfeng and Guangxiao to the other side."

Li Yuchun asked, "Why make such a confusing arrangement? You take your men, and I’ll take mine. There’s no need to mix things up like this."

Xu Qi'an thought for a moment and said, "Boss, you take the Bronze Gongs to patrol, and I’ll take my brothers to another area. That way, it won’t be confusing."

Li Yuchun considered it and found it to be much better, nodding, "Go ahead."

Watching Li Yuchun and the others walk away, Xu Qi'an led his two colleagues into the Goulan.

Familiar with the place, he secured a private room on the second floor, called for a few beautiful girls to pour wine, and the three of them began enjoying food, music, and performances, as if returning to their leisurely patrol days.

"Ningyan…" Song Tingfeng sighed, "I was once a repentant rogue, but I’m always surrounded by bad company."

*Come on, we all know you're still the same old you!* Xu Qi'an didn’t bother to tease him and instead focused on enjoying the music, opening his mouth to let the delicate girl beside him feed him a peanut.

As the saying goes, diligence is temporary, but laziness is eternal.

During the campaign to suppress the bandits in Yunzhou, the tough environment forced Song Tingfeng to practice diligently every day, but once back in the hedonistic capital, his innate laziness and desire for comfort returned.

Still, he had grown more stable and determined than before, and his cultivation had advanced significantly, which was ultimately a good thing.

_Clang!_

Suddenly, the sound of a cup smashing came from downstairs. A drunk swordsman stood up, hiccuping as he angrily cursed the crowd:

“I’ve long heard that the capital is rife with decadence. From high officials to commoners, all are lost in luxury. At first, I didn’t believe it, but in just ten days in this city, I’ve seen nothing but wine and meat and red-lanterned streets!

"In the North and South City arenas, monks are parading their power, yet no expert dares challenge them. What a disgrace!"

His companions quickly stepped forward to pull him back, throwing a few taels of silver on the table as they dragged the drunken man out of the Goulan.

The performance continued, but the conversations in the hall quickly shifted to the Buddhist delegation.

"That Buddhist sect really is brazen to the extreme. We’ve suppressed them for four hundred years, and now they dare preach in the capital. I heard some families in the North City have already converted, even going as far as donating all their wealth to build temples for the monks."

"Why doesn’t the court intervene? Are we really afraid of the Buddhists? Twenty years ago, during the Battle of Shanhai Pass, we were so much stronger."

"Perhaps the court is considering their alliance… But these days, the government is becoming more and more corrupt."

"Shh, be careful what you say."

"Forget about the commotion last night; those were spats between celestials. But hasn’t anyone challenged the young monk in the southern city who has been sitting on the stage for five days? Has our Great Feng lost all its heroes?"

Song Tingfeng put down his cup, pushed aside the woman nestled in his arms, and muttered quietly, "What a mood killer."

"Let's just enjoy ourselves and not worry about such matters. Even if the sky falls, it’s not our concern," Xu Qi'an said with a smile.

Let the grandmasters give it their all and embarrass Emperor Yuanjing even more. It would be perfect if the historians recorded something like: _In the 37th year of Yuanjing, the delegation from the Western Regions arrived in the capital. A young monk held a challenge for five days without defeat, and an old monk summoned a divine aspect to question the imperial court._

*Hehe, that would add another stain to Emperor Yuanjing’s legacy!*

At that moment, a bailiff ran past, holding a bronze gong, banging it as he went, shouting, “The Sitianjian will face off against the Buddhist monks in a duel! The Sitianjian will face off against the Buddhist monks in a duel...

"Everyone, go to the bulletin board to see the imperial announcement!"

…

When Xu Qi'an arrived at the city gates’ bulletin board with Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao, the wide square was already packed with commoners and martial artists. Soldiers guarding the gates and a few Nightwatchers were maintaining order.

Xu Qi'an took off his sabre and used its scabbard to slap away some of the more irritable, rough-mannered martial artists, helping maintain order while listening to the commoners in the front row recite the announcement.

The gist of the proclamation was simple: the delegation from the Western Regions had come a long way and was warmly welcomed by the court. After friendly negotiations, both sides had agreed to a sustainable development initiative, deepening the relationship between the two nations for mutual progress and prosperity.

Then, the Buddhist monks proposed a duel of magic with the Sitianjian as a "technical exchange," and the Sitianjian had agreed. The duel would take place tomorrow at the Grand Plaza outside the Stargazing Tower, where citizens could watch the spectacle.

"Typical government statement, full of rambling nonsense. It still doesn't explain how the duel will happen... But why is there so much fanfare? Was this Master Du’e’s request?"

As Xu Qi'an pondered, he noticed Li Yuchun approaching with his team. He must have been nearby and come over after hearing the bailiff's announcement.

"Boss!"

Xu Qi'an walked over to greet him.

Li Yuchun, seeing the orderliness of the crowd, nodded with satisfaction. "Since returning from Yunzhou, you three have finally shaken off your old laziness and become more mature and responsible."

"That just shows we’ve grown," Xu Qi'an responded with a grin.

...

By noon, under the scorching sun, a large pavilion was erected outside the Sitianjian, providing shade for the capital's nobles and officials. Over a thousand imperial guards surrounded the plaza, keeping onlookers at bay. Commoners and martial artists could only watch from the outer edges.

After lunch, the Western delegation, led by Master Du'e, left the bustling streets of the outer city and made their way to the grand plaza outside the Stargazing Tower.

Chu Caiwei stood on the edge of the Bagua platform, looking down at the approaching group of monks. Among the sea of azure kasayas, there were a few figures draped in red and yellow.

Leading them was the Arhat Du'e, a withered, dark-skinned old man.

"Teacher, the monks are here to stir up trouble," Chu Caiwei said, excitedly pulling out a piece of cake and getting ready to watch the show.

"Let them come," the Jianzheng sipped his wine and basked in the sunlight, utterly relaxed.

"Teacher, are you going to handle this personally?"

"If I take action, the Bodhisattva will have to come personally. Du'e isn’t here to challenge me directly."

"Then who will you send out?" Chu Caiwei tilted her head, analyzing the situation. "Senior Sister Zhong Li is cursed with bad luck—she’d harm herself more than the enemy.

"Senior Brother Song and I are alchemists, not fighters. Second Senior Brother isn’t even in the capital… Only Senior Brother Yang is left."

The Jianzheng sighed.

"Why the sigh, Teacher?"

"Unfortunately, your Senior Brother Yang had a mishap in his cultivation yesterday, and can’t fight."

"What?" Chu Caiwei was stunned, the cake in her mouth suddenly tasteless. She frowned, worried, "What do we do now?"

"I’m troubled too. That’s why I need you to go to the palace and ask His Majesty for a person."

…

Soon after, a woman in a yellow dress rode swiftly into the palace.

Just past noon, Emperor Yuanjing was at Lingbao Temple, studying Daoist scriptures while listening to the National Teacher explain its profound principles, but he couldn’t concentrate.

"Is Your Majesty worried about the upcoming duel?" Luo Yuheng asked softly.

Emperor Yuanjing hesitated for a moment before saying, "I have full confidence in the Jianzheng, but… the Buddhists have come prepared. If we lose this duel, what face will my Great Feng have left?"

"The arcanist system is unique, not focused on combat power. It does seem somewhat inappropriate," Luo Yuheng nodded.

Among all the systems of cultivation, the arcanist system had the weakest combat power. Its strength lay not in individual might but in its ability to enhance national strength. The reason Great Feng’s military was so formidable was partly due to its superior weaponry—war machines, cannons, and ballistae, all crafted by the Sitianjian. No other system could replicate that.

A ninth-grade physician could save lives; an eighth-grade qi-watcher, and a seventh-grade master of feng-shui could improve the land's arrangement. Even fourth-grade masters of formations specialized in creating magical devices rather than fighting.

Arcanists needed the dynasty; their fates were intertwined.

Emperor Yuanjing’s worry deepened.

"Why not ask the dean of Cloud Deer Academy to help? Among all the systems, martial artists are the strongest in terms of raw power. But if there’s one system that’s the most complete, with no weaknesses, it’s Confucianism. The Confucians can handle any situation, no matter how formidable the Buddhists are," Luo Yuheng suggested.

Yuanjing’s eyes brightened, but he quickly shook his head. "I tried to bring Dean Zhao into the court last year, but he refused."

In other words, the emperor couldn’t persuade the scholars of Cloud Deer Academy to help.

As they spoke, the elderly eunuch hurried in, bowing, "Your Majesty, a message from the palace: Chu Caiwei of the Sitianjian seeks an audience on behalf of her master."

"Let her come to Lingbao Temple," Yuanjing commanded.

The eunuch left, and Yuanjing turned to Luo Yuheng, "The Jianzheng is surely coming about the duel. Stay and advise me, National Teacher."

Though he was the emperor, Yuanjing had little expertise in the mystical arts. He needed Luo Yuheng’s guidance to make informed decisions.
