# 322. Honour a Promise

“Lingyin is a prodigy, a rare prodigy. I can’t let such an unpolished jade go to waste.”

Lina’s ocean-blue eyes fixed intently on Xu Lingyin, as if gazing upon a precious treasure.

*A prodigy?*

Xu Pingzhi exchanged glances with his nephew and shook his head. “My daughter has no talent. Her bones and tendons aren’t strong enough; she’s just got a bit of brute strength.”

When Xu Qi'an began martial arts training and Xu Xinnian dedicated himself to studying, it was Xu Pingzhi’s decision. Xu Xinnian lacked martial talent but was exceptionally intelligent, while Xu Qi'an was the opposite.

After Xu Lingyin was born, Xu Pingzhi examined her bones and, over years of observation, became certain that his youngest daughter was not only dull but also physically unsuitable for martial arts.

At the very least, she would struggle immensely with the Refining Vitality stage.

Xu Qi'an also shook his head. His eye for talent was sharper than his second uncle’s. If Xu Lingyin truly were a martial arts prodigy, he would’ve already started grooming her as the Great Feng’s rising star.

As for studying, Xu Xinnian had given up on her at age four. His assessment: “Glazed eyes, no focus—she’s got no mind for study.”

And Xu Lingyin certainly didn’t disappoint her second brother; every teacher who tried teaching her ended up questioning their life choices.

If Little Pea had any talent, it would probably be… eating?

Lina countered Second Uncle Xu’s words, saying, “But she can eat!”

*Are you messing with us?* The whole family squinted at the dark-skinned girl from the Southern Marches.

Lina, seeing the odd expressions around her, asked in surprise, “Have none of you realised she’s a prodigy?”

Xu Xinnian and the others turned their heads to look at Xu Lingyin, who was currently peeling an egg. She tapped one end of the egg on the table, pressed her little palm down on it, and rolled it with quick, confident motions until the shell fell off effortlessly.

*For her age, it was truly… prodigious.* The family couldn’t help but cover their faces.

Xu Qi'an coughed, gently reminding Lina not to joke around. “Eating might be a talent, but not one worth boasting about. What exactly would you teach her?

“How to peel an egg in three breaths? How to fit an extra bowl of rice into every meal?”

Lina’s healthy, tan skin suddenly flushed as she waved her hands in defence. “I’m not teaching her how to eat; I want to teach her shaman Gu techniques.”

Xu Pingzhi’s face changed as he looked at Xu Lingyin with wide, startled eyes. “You didn’t eat any bugs, did you?”

Xu Lingyin looked intrigued and asked, “Can you eat bugs?”

“Nonononono!” Xu Xinnian and Second Uncle Xu both waved their hands in unison.

The thought of her learning Gu techniques immediately brought to mind one question: *did Little Pea eat bugs?*

Xu Qi'an inwardly sighed, then asked with interest, “You mean she’s a natural prodigy in shaman cultivation?”

Lina nodded, then clarified, “To be precise, she’s a prodigy for the Strength Gu. Lingyin has robust bones and vigorous qi and blood. In our Strength Gu tribe, such a prodigy appears only once in decades.

“Isn’t it strange to you all? For such a little child, she eats an astonishing amount.”

*Isn’t that just because she’s a glutton?* The Xu family thought, then had a sudden realisation. By anyone else’s standards, she’d have eaten herself sick by now, yet here she was, perfectly lively.

Lina restrained her appetite and explained, “In our Strength Gu tribe, training starts in childhood. We choose a Strength Gu to swallow, allowing it to reside within.

“In the early years, the Strength Gu absorbs the host’s essence and energy. A child without a strong constitution grows frail, and because the Strength Gu shares life with its host, it won’t drain them entirely but will weaken alongside them.

“This causes innate weakness.”

She said this while gazing passionately at Xu Lingyin. “But she’s different. She could provide a perfect home for the Strength Gu, building a solid foundation from a young age. With her strong bones and natural strength, even if she doesn’t cultivate her spirit, her power already surpasses her peers. With proper training, she could soar to incredible heights.”

The family exchanged looks.

After a moment of consideration, Auntie tentatively asked, “Would she become as… strong of appetite as you?”

Lina shook her head. “No, no.”

Auntie breathed a sigh of relief, only to hear the little dark-skinned girl modestly say, “She’ll eat even more than me.”

“…”

Auntie didn’t even need to think; “Absolutely not. Husband, dear?”

Xu Pingzhi turned to his son and nephew, seeking their opinions. “What do you two think?”

Xu Qi'an commented, “Since she’s hopeless with books and lacks the foundation for martial arts, why not give it a try?”

Auntie slapped the table in irritation, feeling offended and cold. “Xu Ningyan, how could you say that? Isn’t Lingyin your little sister?”

It seemed Auntie would be able to recall her past grievances today, right now, bringing an end to any motherly affection she might have had toward her nephew.

Xu Lingyue murmured, “Mum, Big Brother isn’t wrong…”

Auntie, caught off guard, was suddenly stabbed in the back by her own daughter.

Xu Xinnian said, “Taking her as a disciple is fine, but I have a question. How long does it take for a Strength Gu practitioner to complete their training?”

Lina answered without hesitation, “As short as five years, or as long as twenty, depending on the person’s talent.”

Xu Xinnian nodded and glanced at Lingyin. “So, would you be able to stay in the capital for five, even twenty years?”

Lina’s mouth worked faster than her mind. “As long as you feed me, I could stay forever.”

“Absolutely not!” 

The Xu family responded in unison.

*…It’s just a few grains of your rice,* she thought to herself, feeling wronged by their reluctance to feed her.

In the end, Xu Pingzhi, as the head of the household, made the final decision. “Then we’ll entrust Lina with teaching my little daughter.”

Xu Xinnian and Xu Qi'an looked at each other, puzzled. Were they really going to let Lina stay in the capital for five, even twenty years?

Wouldn’t the tuition fees be prohibitively high?

To this, Xu Pingzhi chuckled. “Lingyin is just a girl. She’s not aiming to become the greatest warrior. Learning a little is enough. Even if she doesn’t fully master it, it doesn’t matter.

“You two, however, always want to reach the top in everything you do.”

Xu Xinnian and Xu Qi'an had no further arguments, thinking that their second uncle (father) had a point.

Lina patted Xu Lingyin’s head and said, “If you came with me to the Southern Marches, my father would take you on as his personal disciple. In just ten years, you’d be able to lift a mountain.”

Xu Qi'an imagined the scene: ten years later, a grown Xu Lingyin, carrying a mountain, her every step causing tremors, happily exclaiming, “Big Bwother, I’m back! I brought you a mountain. Catch!”

*A daughter of the Xu family grows up, strength enough to move mountains…* Xu Qi'an shivered at the thought.

…

On the eve before dawn, the sky was a deep indigo.

A ginger cat, moving with graceful strides, roamed the empty, silent streets until it reached the gates of Sun Manor.

It lightly leapt onto the rooftop of a street-side building, gazing around, then jumped back down, swiftly darting to the entrance of the Sun Manor.

The ginger cat’s throat rolled, revealing a round shape within, and slowly forced it out.

It was a small jade mirror. As it emerged, rather than falling, it hovered in mid-air, flashed with a radiant light, and out dropped an unconscious young noble.

The ginger cat opened its mouth wide, took the jade mirror back into its belly, raised its tail, and quickly left.

A quarter of an hour later, the yawning gatekeeper opened the main doors, and upon seeing the finely dressed young man lying on the ground, he gasped. Recognizing the young master’s face, he rushed inside, calling for help.

Soon, several servants hurried over, lifting the young noble and carrying him indoors.

Minister Sun rushed in after hearing the news, his heart pounding when he saw his son lying unconscious on the silk couch.

“Master, the young master is merely unconscious and hasn’t sustained any serious injuries,” reported the old butler by the bedside.

“What do you mean by ‘no serious injuries’?” Minister Sun raised an eyebrow.

“The young master… was lashed dozens of times, his skin torn and bruised, but thankfully, they’re all superficial wounds. With medicine applied, he’s already on the mend.” The butler lowered his head.

“Outrageous! A betrayal of their word!”

Minister Sun’s face turned ashen, a mix of pain and anger in his expression, but then, as if remembering something, his fiery anger suddenly faded.

After a moment of silence, Minister Sun sighed, “It’s good that he’s back.”

…

The Tower of Noble Spirit, in a tearoom.

“King Yu has long lost any ambition for fame and power, which is why he was willing to repay my favour. Had he been the same King Yu as before, he likely wouldn’t have agreed so easily. As for the Duke of Cao, he has joined forces with the Zhenbei King’s deputy general, scheming against my invincible vajra.

“I remember Duke Wei saying that court battles are essentially struggles over interests and that one must learn to compromise. So I agreed to their terms.”

Xu Qi’an held his teacup, sitting in the well-lit tearoom, and turned his head to look at Wei Yuan, who was basking in the sunlight and enjoying the scenery from the lookout tower.

“Not bad. You have the mental ability, but your temper makes you unfit for the court,” Wei Yuan nodded.

“It’s mostly due to your excellent guidance, Duke Wei,” Xu Qi’an replied modestly.

Wei Yuan chuckled, placing his hands on the railing, gazing at the sunny landscape. After a long pause, he asked, “You’ve been running around for the imperial examination fraud case, hardly spending any time at the Constabulary. It must have been tiring.”

“But I’ve learned a lot, too,” Xu Qi’an replied, slurping a sip of tea.

Wei Yuan laughed, “Try understand my main point.”

Freeloader Xu froze, a feeling of dread creeping in, “Tiring?”

Wei Yuan shook his head, without turning around, and said warmly, “Hardly spending any time at the Constabulary.”

“…”

Wei Yuan continued smoothly, “So, this month’s salary is forfeited.”

Xu Qi’an stared blankly at Wei Yuan’s back, his face crestfallen, “Duke Wei, I’ve already lost my salary for this month.”

“Oh, really?” Wei Yuan paused, then slowly nodded, “Then next month’s is forfeited too.”

“???”

*Did I somehow displease him…?* The clever Freeloader Xu didn’t pursue the topic, knowing it was futile to argue with a superior.

“Duke Wei, why did the Zhenbei King’s deputy return to the capital?”

“Tensions are rising in the north, and there’s a shortage of supplies. He’s here to request funds,” Wei Yuan replied.

“What kind of person is the Zhenbei King?”

“A domineering man.”

*Domineering types are often unreasonable, and as a royal king, he can ignore protocol to some extent…* Xu Qi’an thought.

After bidding farewell to Wei Yuan, he mounted his little mare, felt the weight of a bulging sack in the saddle, and trotted off toward King Huai Manor.

Now, he had to fulfill his promise to meet the Zhenbei King’s deputy.

*It’s strange, though. Chu Xianglong told me to come to the Zhenbei King’s Manor after matters were settled, which suggests he’s staying at the manor rather than his own home during his time in the capital.*

*Most likely, he’s spending most of his time at the Zhenbei King’s Manor. And since the Zhenbei King is stationed at the frontier, the manor houses only his consort, renowned as the most beautiful woman in the kingdom…*

*From the Zhenbei King’s perspective, he would never allow his lieutenant to stay under the same roof as his widowed consort.*

*Yet Chu Xianglong is doing exactly that, openly and without concealment. This implies he has the Zhenbei King’s approval.*

*Why would the Zhenbei King permit this?*

*His trust in his deputy must far surpass his trust in the consort…*

…

King Huai Manor, in the outer hall.

A woman, veiled in gauze and dressed in a resplendent palace gown, sat at a table, arranging a tea set.

In the hall, Chu Xianglong, clad in armor with a sabre at his waist, stood with a resolute gaze fixed on the consort, speaking in a low tone:

“According to the guards here, the consort has gone missing twice recently without explanation?”

The veiled woman paid him no heed, focused on her tea set with delicate, graceful movements.

“How did you elude the guards? And how did you slip past the Sitianjian arcanists? Whom have you been meeting lately, and what events have you encountered?”

“Annoying!”

The veiled woman’s brow furrowed, her voice chilly, “Are you interrogating me?”

“I wouldn’t dare!”

Chu Xianglong lowered his head, speaking calmly, “This time, I’ve returned to the capital not only to request military funds from His Majesty but also to escort the consort north, to reunite with His Highness. You should prepare.”

After a pause, he looked up, his gaze fixed on her bright, delicate eyes, “Your servant will be staying here during this period. If the consort wishes to leave, I’ll accompany you.”

The veiled woman said nothing.

At this moment, a guard entered the hall and saluted, “General Chu, Silver Gong Xu Qi’an requests an audience.”

Chu Xianglong nodded, glanced at the consort, and cupped his hands in farewell as he exited the hall.

*Xu Qi’an… what is he doing here?* The veiled woman lowered her head, her eyes sparkling with slyness, plotting something unknown.
