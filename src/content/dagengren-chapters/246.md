# 246. Daoist Jinlian: Let Xu Qi'an Deal With It

“The old servant does indeed recognise her. Xiaorou used to work at Xie Pavillion. Three years ago, when Chunfeng Palace needed more maids, I noticed that she was both pretty and quick with her hands, so I recommended her for the position…”

“When the body was pulled out, didn’t you go to take a look?” Xu Qi’an suddenly asked.

“How could I dare? This old servant is too old to handle the sight of the dead.”

“Oh. Continue telling us about this Huang Xiaorou.”

Perhaps due to her age, Nanny Rong's emotions were rather volatile. She suddenly became angry: “That ungrateful girl! If it weren’t for this old servant’s recommendation, how could she have become one of Consort Fu’s head maids? After all these years, she never even came back to visit me.

“Even those uncultured men still remember to show respect to their godfathers. Hmph, when women are heartless, nothing is more chilling.”

“Nanny, please don’t say that. You’re too old to dodge the crafty attacks of a boxer.” Xu Qi’an joked, then asked, “During the autopsy, I discovered that Huang Xiaorou had a fatal wound on her left chest. Do you know anything about that?”

Nanny Rong thought for a while, her expression one of deep recollection: “A wound… There was indeed such a thing. I think it happened the year before she was transferred to Chunfeng Palace. For some reason, she got up in the middle of the night and stabbed her own chest with a pair of scissors.

“Fortunately, the maid who shared a room with her discovered it early, called for the imperial physician, and saved her life.”

Xu Qi’an and Princess Huaiqing frowned simultaneously.

There was a flaw in Nanny Rong’s story. The scar Xu Qi’an saw reached the heart and was clearly a fatal wound. The cost of treating such an injury would have been far beyond what a maid could afford.

“As the saying goes, those who survive a great disaster are destined for good fortune. Xiaorou was lucky to escape death, and the next year she was transferred to Chunfeng Palace, no longer having to do menial tasks. She was very beautiful and had a chance of being favoured by the Emperor, you know.”

Xu Qi’an recalled Huang Xiaorou’s swollen face after her death, and his lips twitched.

Whoever saved Huang Xiaorou, one thing was clear—under such massive blood loss, she would not have had much time left. Whoever it was that saved her must have been watching her closely.

If Nanny Rong was telling the truth, then the issue must be with…

“What was the name of that maid?” Princess Huaiqing asked the question before Xu Qi’an could, adding, “The one who shared a room with Huang Xiaorou.”

“Your Highness, let me think…” Nanny Rong said, pondering for a while before she responded uncertainly, “I think her name was… He’er?”

It was obvious to Xu Qi’an that Princess Huaiqing’s pupils suddenly contracted.

*She recognises this maid named He’er…* Xu Qi’an concluded silently.

“I’ve finished my questions. Do either of Your Highnesses have anything to add?” Xu Qi’an turned to look at Princess Huaiqing and Princess Lin’an.

Lin’an shook her head cooperatively, while Huaiqing seemed lost in thought, not responding.

Just as Xu Qi’an was about to leave and proceed to the Imperial Pharmacy, Nanny Rong suddenly said, “Sir, this old servant has something to say to you.”

Saying this, she got up and walked a few steps away.

Xu Qi’an followed her. Nanny Rong gazed at the distant figures of Princess Huaiqing and the others, then looked back at Xu Qi’an with a solemn expression and said:

“Sir, there are too many secrets buried deep within the inner palace. Once you set foot in it, you’ll keep sinking deeper.”

“Nanny, you’re so simple-minded, like a firefly in the night. Your grey hair, the age spots on your face, and your large belly have all deeply impressed me.” Xu Qi’an praised her.

*Go on, tell me all your secrets.*

“Sir has such a sweet tongue. It’s only because you’re so handsome that I’m telling you this.” Nanny Rong slowly returned to her recliner and stopped speaking.

Xu Qi’an didn’t move, surprised. “That’s it?”

Nanny Rong shook her head. “This old servant knows very little. The secrets of the inner palace are not something one should know.”

*… Heh, this old woman! Wasting my time! I thought she had something significant to reveal.*

In Xu Qi’an’s mind, if Nanny Rong had called him aside, there had to be some "unspeakable secret" waiting for him.

But it turned out to be just a word of caution!

As they left the courtyard of Xie Pavillion, Xu Qi’an noticed that the vibrant red-robed Princess Lin’an was still waiting outside, but Princess Huaiqing was nowhere to be seen.

“Where is the Eldest Princess?”

Lin’an immediately looked displeased, raising her eyebrows, “It’s always Huaiqing, Huaiqing! Have you forgotten who you are? I’m standing right here, and you pretend not to see me.”

In the sunlight, her round, delicate face had a soft glow, her cheeks a rosy hue, like a piece of flawless jade without a blemish.

Her raised eyebrows and the discontent in her charming peach blossom eyes only added to her adorableness.

Even when she was angry, she was more cute than anything.

“I’m glad the Eldest Princess has left. Now we can be alone together,” Xu Qi’an said cheerfully.

Lin’an’s face turned slightly red as she glanced nervously at the nearby guards. In a low voice, she said, “Running Dog, don’t talk to me like that.”

As an unmarried princess, she wasn’t used to such sweet-talking and felt both shy and flustered whenever she heard such flirtations.

“Your Highness, you’re too modest. You’re like a light in the darkness, so radiant that even the sun can’t outshine your brilliance…” Xu Qi’an switched to a different metaphorical expression, once again using it on Princess Lin’an.

Lin’an was both delighted and embarrassed, a bit helpless as well. She didn’t know when it had started, but she gradually found herself unable to control this little Bronze Gong.

When she had first taken him from Huaiqing, he was obedient and swore to sever ties with Huaiqing, vowing to be her loyal servant.

But over time, she realised that she couldn’t keep this man in check. Although he appeared humble and respectful, whenever they were alone, she always ended up on the back foot.

And yet, somehow, she never seemed to mind this dynamic. Even in front of Huaiqing, she had always been a competitive woman.

Thinking of this, Lin’an raised her beautifully curved chin and questioned him, “Why didn’t you say that when Huaiqing was around?”

*How could I say the same thing in front of both of you…? If it were Huaiqing, I’d have to change my approach: ‘Your Highness, you’re like a pure white snow lotus blooming in the cold wind. Your peerless beauty, your long and graceful legs, and your impressive 36D chest… have all deeply moved me.’*

Xu Qi’an changed the subject, “Where did the Eldest Princess go?”

“How should we know?” Lin’an replied.

Biaobiao seemed like she wanted to roll her eyes, but mindful of her etiquette, she forced herself to hold back and said, "We should hurry to the Imperial Pharmacy; solving a case is like putting out a fire, there’s no time to waste."

Xu Qi'an looked at her and speculated, "Are you worried that Huaiqing might destroy the evidence?"

Biaobiao pretended not to hear, walking ahead with light steps, the sway of her skirt occasionally revealing the peach-like shape of her hips.

*When God spread wisdom across the earth, this princess, like Lingyin, was clever enough to use an umbrella... Dealing with her is indeed simpler and easier than dealing with Huaiqing... But she’s just so devious, it’s hard to guard against.* Xu Qi'an muttered internally as he accompanied the princess to the Imperial Pharmacy.

…

Lingbao Temple.

In a tranquil room filled with the scent of sandalwood, two women of extraordinary status were sitting across from each other, drinking tea. Sunlight filtered through the lattice windows, casting neat square patches of light on the floor. Dust motes danced in the beams.

Luo Yuheng sat on a meditation cushion backed by the character "Dao," holding a *fuchen* in one hand and a teacup in the other. She took a sip, her beautiful eyes narrowing in enjoyment, highlighting her long, thick lashes.

"Tea grown by Nanzhi is truly different from ordinary varieties. If I could drink a pot of this every day, I wouldn't want to be a celestial being," Luo Yuheng sighed.

The woman sitting opposite Daoist Luo wore a complex dark blue gown and ornate headgear, her face hidden behind a light veil. Only the contours of her cheeks were faintly visible, with just her clear, bright eyes and finely shaped eyebrows exposed.

"This tea matures every three years, and only yields three pounds. Most of it is tribute to the palace," the veiled woman said in a soft, seductive voice, rich with the magnetism of a mature woman.

She lifted her veil slightly, took a sip, and then asked, "Has anything interesting happened in the capital lately?"

Luo Yuheng sighed helplessly, "You're not interested in court struggles, but aren’t they the most thrilling and captivating? As for cases, from the tax silver case to the Sangpo case, you've heard about them several times... This is the capital, how many cases can I tell you about?"

"Hasn't Consort Fu's case yet to be concluded?" The veiled woman’s eyes curved slightly, as if smiling.

"That case is still being handled by that Bronze Gong. I don’t know the details," Luo Yuheng downed her tea in one gulp and poured herself another cup. "After all, it’s the Emperor’s family matter. If you're interested, you can ask Princess Huaiqing."

"Forget it, I don't feel like dealing with the royal family," the woman shook her head and then added, "I’ve seen that Bronze Gong twice. He's rather annoying."

"You’ve met him?" Luo Yuheng was taken aback.

The veiled woman made a sound of acknowledgment, dipped her jade-like finger in the tea, and drew a pig's head on the table, her eyes curving again as she hummed, "He took my sachet and wouldn’t return it."

Luo Yuheng nodded, following the topic, "That person is not ordinary. He is highly regarded and nurtured by Wei Yuan. Given time, another high-ranking martial artist will rise in the Great Feng, with boundless potential."

Under the veil, the woman curled her lips dismissively and said, "How high can he rise? With the Zhenbei King around, no martial artist in Great Feng can truly lift their heads. He’s just a Bronze Gong, after all."

Luo Yuheng smiled slightly. That Bronze Gong was indeed talented, and with Wei Yuan's appreciation and being chosen by the Earth Sect as a holder of the Earth Book, he was among the more outstanding heroes of the world. Still, he was just one of many exceptional individuals.

"I do admire his ability to solve cases. So many major cases, with their twists and turns, the process is quite interesting," the veiled woman said.

Luo Yuheng was about to reply when her cheeks suddenly flushed with a layer of intoxicating red. She frowned, put down her teacup, and whispered, "Nanzhi, you should leave now..."

The veiled woman looked at her, nodded slightly, stood up, and walked to the door. Just before leaving, she turned back and said helplessly, "If it becomes unbearable, just submit to Emperor Yuanjing. Or find a man; if this monthly fire continues to torment you, I’m really afraid you’ll turn into a nymphomaniac."

Luo Yuheng ignored her, her frown deepening.

The veiled woman opened the door of the tranquil room, stepped onto the eaves, and followed the stone path out of the courtyard.

"Whew…"

Luo Yuheng exhaled a scorching breath, bracing herself against the table as she stood up. When her full chest brushed against the edge, she let out an irresistibly seductive moan, her legs weakening as she nearly collapsed.

She stumbled out of the tranquil room, her exquisite face flushed, her eyes glistening with desire, irresistibly beautiful.

Splash...

Luo Yuheng leaped into the small pond in the backyard.

The icy water engulfed the mature and voluptuous body of the stunning Daoist. Moments later, there was a series of crackling sounds as a thick layer of ice formed on the pond's surface.

The chill spread to the surrounding rockery and pavilion, coating them with a thin, transparent layer of frost.

After a quarter of an hour, the ice began to melt, wisps of steam rising from the water. Then, bubbles began to churn and burst on the surface with a "pop."

Gurgle, gurgle...

More and more bubbles boiled up, the steam thickening until the entire pond seemed to be boiling.

This process continued for a full half hour. The water level dropped by several inches, and when the pond finally calmed down, warm, humid air lingered over the backyard for a long time.

Luo Yuheng emerged from the water, her hairpin dislodged, letting her dark hair cling to her fair cheeks. Her eyes were still misty, her face flushed as if intoxicated, incredibly alluring.

"Meow~"

A soft meow sounded as an orange cat gracefully leaped over the courtyard wall, its movements agile as it perched on the rockery behind Luo Yuheng.

"This evil fire will destroy your Dao foundation, Luo Yuheng. At most, you can endure for another three years," the orange cat spoke in a warm, ancient voice.

"Why has Senior Brother come?" Luo Yuheng asked, half-closing her starry eyes as she soaked in the water.

"Let me offer you some advice," the orange cat said. “The Sitianjian has a pill called the Rebirth Pill that can alleviate your symptoms. Right now, you're dealing with lust, but soon, you'll have to face greed, anger, ignorance, and hatred... It won't be easy for you.

"Sigh, of the three Daoist sects, only the Heaven Sect is free from the burdens of worldly affairs. Perhaps the Heaven Sect's philosophy is the correct one."

Luo Yuheng opened her eyes and sneered, "The Heaven Sect is heartless and merciless, assimilating with heaven and earth, devoid of joy, sorrow, love, or hate. Even if one ascends to immortality, they lose their self in the process. That is heresy."

She paused, frowning slightly. "Of course I know the Rebirth Pill can ease my symptoms, but the Jianzheng has never liked my Human Sect, and he would never give me such a pill."

The orange cat spoke unhurriedly, “Xu Qi'an has taken the Rebirth Pill, and its effects have not yet dissipated. A bowl of his vital blood could be used as a medicinal guide. Although the resulting pill would not be as potent as the Rebirth Pill, it could at least solve your immediate problem.

"He would be willing to do this small favor for a poor Daoist like me."

Luo Yuheng was silent for a moment before she retorted, "You should focus on yourself. The demonic aspect you split off has claimed most of your power. With just your remaining soul, trying to destroy the demon is nothing but wishful thinking."

The orange cat chuckled, "When the time comes, I will need my junior sister's help, of course. But by the time I am confident enough to subdue the demon, the holders of the Earth Book fragments will likely have grown strong. All you'll need to do is stand by as support."

Luo Yuheng frowned, "Senior brother should know that unless I reach the first rank, in my current state, if I get entangled in karma, it will most likely lead to my demise."

"That is why I will assist you in reaching the first rank."

Luo Yuheng turned her head sharply, her beautiful eyes burning as she stared intently at the orange cat, saying nothing.

"Why don't you practice dual cultivation with Emperor Yuanjing?" the orange cat suggested, raising a paw as if to lick it, but then stopping, reason winning over instinct.

"His fortune isn't sufficient," Luo Yuheng replied.

For the first time, she revealed why she refused to practice dual cultivation with Emperor Yuanjing.

The orange cat nodded slowly, then frowned, "So you're only using his fortune to suppress your karmic fire without going further. And after that? Surely you have a plan for the future?"

Luo Yuheng nodded, "I will wait for the new emperor to ascend."

The orange cat understood, but then hesitated, "Given the current weakened state of the Great Feng, each generation is likely to be worse than the last. None of Emperor Yuanjing's heirs has the potential to revitalise the empire, and you know this better than I do."

Luo Yuheng smiled, "Revitalisation doesn't necessarily depend on the monarch. With someone like Wei Yuan, the empire's patcher, as long as he survives the purge and controls the new emperor after Emperor Yuanjing's death, the empire will eventually recover and flourish."

"So, you plan to wait until the national strength is restored before practicing dual cultivation with the new emperor...," the orange cat mused, nodding at first but then shaking its head. "There is no rush for that. The reasons behind the Great Feng's decline are complex, with implications so vast that they are terrifying to contemplate."

Luo Yuheng frowned, "In terms of strategy, senior brother, you're no less capable than Wei Yuan."

"This Poor Daoist is just speculating; things are still unclear," the orange cat said, then added, "By the way, Li Miaozhen is coming to the capital."

"Just have Number Four deal with it. As a disciple of the Human Sect, it's his duty to handle the Heaven Sect Saintess."

"Well... They are all members of the Heaven and Earth Society. It's not good to have them kill each other."

Luo Yuheng turned her head away in a haughty gesture.

*Fine... When the time comes, I'll just push Xu Qi'an to mediate...* the orange cat thought to itself.

...

At the Imperial Pharmacy.

The elderly eunuch in charge pulled a ledger from the bookshelf and handed it to Xu Qi'an, who had come to investigate the case. His voice was sharp, "The records of the Imperial Pharmacy's expenditures are cleared every five years. If you'd come a few years later, you wouldn't have found anything."

In the side hall, Biaobiao was holding a bowl of tea, her lively eyes following the ledger.

Xu Qi'an thought she wanted to see it, so he asked, "Would Your Highness like to take a look?"

"We have no interest in such things; they give us a headache just looking at them," she said crisply.

Xu Qi'an couldn't understand how Chu Caiwei, that foolish girl, had become best friends with Huaiqing. Logically, shouldn't people with similar dispositions naturally gravitate towards each other?

Chu Caiwei clearly should have been best friends with Lin'an; the two of them would have been a much better match.

"Your Highness is incredibly wise; it's just that your talents lie in other areas," Xu Qi'an said as he opened the ledger, adding, "I have a younger sister at home who is just as clever as Your Highness, though her talents don't lie in studying."

"Where do her talents lie?"

"In memorising recipes."

"...."

This ledger recorded all the pills and medicines distributed by the Imperial Pharmacy in the thirty-second year of Emperor Yuanjing's reign.

Given Huang Xiaorou's injuries, there were only a few pills that could have saved her, so finding them should have been easy. He just needed to figure out which life-saving pills the Imperial Pharmacy had, then trace the name to find them. It should have been a simple task.

However, after searching for an entire tea session, Xu Qi'an found nothing suspicious.

"In the thirty-second year of Yuanjing, the Sitianjian and Lingbao Temple provided a total of 364 types of pills, amounting to 790 bottles. Of these, only three were top-grade pills, which were awarded by His Majesty to outer ministers in the thirty-second, thirty-third, and thirty-sixth years."

Xu Qi'an closed the ledger and looked at Lin'an, saying, "I haven’t find the pill that saved Huang Xiaorou."

Upon hearing this, the clever Lin'an pondered for a long time before suggesting, "Could the pill not have come from the Imperial Pharmacy?"

Xu Qi'an shook his head, "In the entire Great Feng, only Lingbao Temple and the Sitianjian can produce pills. So the pill must have come from one of these two places.

"Huang Xiaorou, a mere palace maid, would have surely died without someone powerful saving her. But in the harem, who could bypass the Imperial Pharmacy and obtain pills from the Sitianjian or Lingbao Temple?"

There was only one possible answer: Emperor Yuanjing!

*It couldn't have been him. The Imperial Pharmacy belongs to Emperor Yuanjing, the entire palace is his. The Imperial Pharmacy is where he draws his pills from; he has no reason to bypass it. That would be like having my salary deposited in a bank account but then opening a separate account to secretly stash some pocket money...* Xu Qi'an suddenly thought of a possibility.
