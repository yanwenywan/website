# 350. Escape Plan

Inside the tent, Yang Yan sat cross-legged on a cushion, accepting the tea handed to him by the High Court Deputy Justice. He said, “The attacker was a black river dragon,[^1] likely from the dragon tribe of the northern yao clans. A powerful one; fourth rank, I cannot beat it on the water.”

Being a man of few words, he succinctly summarised the situation, providing a comparison of his own strength to his opponent’s, before falling silent. 

Chu Xianglong’s expression changed drastically.

The mention of a fourth rank river dragon left the High Court Deputy Justice and the others visibly unsettled, a mixture of shock, fear, and worry crossing their faces.

Chief Constable Chen furrowed his brows and asked, “General Chu, do you know the background of this river dragon?”

As he spoke, he narrowed his eyes, scrutinising Chu Xianglong closely.

The others turned their gaze toward Chu Xianglong, the mounting pressure forcing him to break his silence. After a moment’s hesitation, he said in a deep voice, “A black river dragon, fourth rank... If I’m not mistaken, it’s the Lord of Tangshan.”

*So he does know the river dragon...* Xu Qi’an’s eyes flickered with thought. The ambush at Flowstone Shoals had been orchestrated by the northern yao clans. If they had made a move, what about their usual allies, the barbarian tribes?

Moreover, the princess consort’s journey to the northern border had been conducted in utmost secrecy, with the official vessel traveling at high speed. The northern yao clans shouldn’t have had the time to set up an ambush in advance.

Unless they already knew the princess was heading north.

*Our “foremost beauty of the Great Feng” truly isn’t simple. To think she warrants such an elaborate ambush deep within enemy territory... Chu Xianglong’s earlier reaction suggested he was utterly shocked by the yao clan’s involvement. This indicates even he didn’t anticipate their move...* As these thoughts raced through Xu Qi’an’s mind, countless possibilities surfaced.

Constable Chen spoke in a low voice, “Gold Gong Yang, aside from the black river dragon, were there any other enemies?”

Yang Yan shook his head. “None detected.”

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The High Court Deputy Justice, visibly more at ease, said, “If it’s just one fourth rank opponent, we don’t need to worry too much...”

Before he could finish, Xu Qi’an let out a derisive laugh and said, “The northern barbarians and yao clans are cut from the same cloth. If the yao clans have struck, can the barbarians be far behind?

“If I’m right, each major checkpoint on the road to the northern border will have experts lying in wait. Trust me, unless we abandon our carriages and supplies and take a mountain path, we’ll eventually fall into another ambush.”

In these times, there were only so many official roads, while countless winding paths existed that even horses had trouble traversing, let alone carriages carrying supplies.

In the past, highwaymen could earn a fortune simply by occupying a single stretch of official road and robbing passing merchants and travellers.

Xu Qi’an’s words made the two censors and the High Court Deputy Justice immediately look to Constable Chen. They had lost faith in Chu Xianglong and now sought Chen’s judgment as someone more trustworthy and experienced.

Chief Constable Chen nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “Sir Xu’s analysis is quite reasonable—perhaps even entirely correct. I’d go so far as to suggest that if there’s a fourth rank expert in the waters, there may be fourth rank experts at other ambush points too, or even more of them.

“It’s not beyond the combined forces of the northern barbarians and yao clans to field several fourth rank experts.”

In the jianghu, a fourth rank expert was a figure of great renown, a local hegemon. Within the imperial court, while fourth rank experts weren’t numerous, they certainly weren’t rare.

It was simple logic—if the jianghu had more fourth rank experts than the imperial court, then it certainly wouldn’t be the imperial court that ruled the world.

The northern barbarians and yao clans were effectively a northern counterpart to the imperial court.

“What... What are we going to do?”

The three civil officials were visibly panicked.

If the enemy had two fourth rank experts, their group would be in peril. If there were three, it would mean certain annihilation.

A heavy, solemn silence descended over the tent.

The three civil officials and Chief Constable Chen furrowed their brows deeply. Even with the hundred-strong Imperial Guard outside, as well as their personal escorts, they felt no sense of security.

In truth, the delegation’s defenses were already formidable: one hundred Imperial Guards, dozens of escorts, several Silver Gongs, eight Bronze Gongs, and one fourth rank Gold Gong.

With such a roster, they could travel unchallenged across the Great Feng, even to the northern or northeastern borders, without incident.

When Inspector General Zhang led his delegation to Yunzhou, the scale was similar, and the journey had been entirely uneventful.

But now, they seemed to be facing a coordinated ambush from the northern yao clans and barbarians—backed by the powers in the north.

“Why do the northern barbarians and yao clans want to assassinate the princess consort? And how did they manage to prepare an ambush in advance?” Chief Constable Chen fixed Chu Xianglong with a sharp gaze.

“That’s none of your business,” Chu Xianglong retorted coldly.

Chief Constable Chen snapped, “If we’d known in advance that the enemy was the northern barbarians and yao clans, why not dispatch the Imperial Guard to escort her? Why hide her within the delegation?”

The dire situation had pushed him to the brink of anger, leaving him unafraid of confronting Chu Xianglong’s authority.

*Indeed, if there had been any expectation of an ambush, deploying the Imperial Guard directly would have been far safer. After all, this is the Great Feng’s territory. A large contingent of the Imperial Guard escorting the princess would leave even fourth rank experts from the northern clans powerless to act.*

*After all, the Imperial Guard would certainly carry powerful weaponry, and the army itself boasted numerous experts.*

*Yet Emperor Yuanjing had opted for the princess to secretly travel with the delegation, departing the capital under cover.*

Xu Qi’an’s mind raced, arriving at a chilling conclusion: 

They were guarding against enemies within the court itself!

*Someone within the court doesn’t want the princess to reach the northern border to meet King Huai... What will happen if she does? This conspiracy runs deeper than it seems.*

*And how did the yao clans and barbarians learn of the plan and set up an ambush?*

The threads of this mystery were tangled and disorganized, leaving Xu Qi’an with a headache.

As the argument between Chu Xianglong and the three civil officials grew heated, Xu Qi’an pressed his fingers to his temples, lost in thought.

“There’s actually a simpler solution—lure the enemy in and extract information directly from their experts,” Xu Qi’an mused.

The more he considered it, the more feasible it seemed. First, his Unbreakable Vajra Body rivaled—or even surpassed—fourth rank strength. Even if he couldn’t defeat a fourth rank expert, it would be hard for one to kill him.

After all, martial artists couldn’t directly attack the soul. If it were a fourth rank Daoist, Xu Qi’an wouldn’t hesitate to flee—his soul cultivation was only at the sixth rank.

Even though his soul was stronger than most of the same rank, it couldn’t possibly contend with a fourth rank Daoist.

Second, he had the Confucian magic book, akin to a rare skill scroll in a game.

*Though I’m low levelled, I can still rely on pay-to-win mechanics.*

During the Conflict of Heaven and Man, the Confucian magic book’s abilities had offset his weaknesses, allowing him to defeat Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen.

Finally, within his body resided the monk Shenshu, his ultimate trump card.

However, Shenshu’s existence couldn’t be revealed. If he had to summon the monk, it would only be in the absence of witnesses—otherwise, killing to silence them would be inevitable...

*Saving the princess alone wouldn’t justify taking such risks.* Xu Qi’an rubbed his chin thoughtfully.

Rescuing the princess was secondary—his real goal was gathering intelligence.

*The north is the domain of the Zhenbei King. Going straight there would mean plunging headfirst into his surveillance network, with every move under his watchful eye.*

*That would leave me with two options: either abandon the investigation or clash head-on with the Zhenbei King.*

For a skilled detective with impeccable logic, it was impossible to let himself fall into such a passive position. He had to gather more clues and intelligence before arriving in the north. Only then could he formulate a plan and proceed with the investigation.

At that moment, the arguing voices ceased.

Chu Xianglong spread out a map on the ground and asked in a serious tone, “Gold Gong Yang, have you been followed on this journey?”

Yang Yan shook his head.

As a peak-rank fourth rank warrior, few could track him unnoticed. The intuition of a martial artist wasn’t just for show.

Chu Xianglong exhaled in relief and nodded. “Good, then we still have a chance. In this situation, going back is obviously not an option. We must reach Jiangzhou City as soon as possible to seek assistance from the Provincial Governor and the Jiangzhou Commander-General and mobilize the garrison troops for defense.”

The others nodded slowly.

Jiangzhou City was a provincial capital, well-stocked with troops and experts. Once inside the city, they would be safe. If the fourth-rank experts of the barbarians and demon tribes dared to attack within the city, they would be doomed to fail.

“If we can successfully reach Jiangzhou City, we can either request reinforcements from the court or directly mobilize the Jiangzhou military to escort the princess to the north,” Chu Xianglong added.

“That makes sense,” the Deputy Justice of the High Court agreed.

“In that case, we need to plan our route,” Chu Xianglong said, pointing to the map.

“The shortest way to Jiangzhou is the official road we’re currently taking, which would take only two days. But it’s also the most dangerous route. So, we’ll have to take a detour.”

Constable Chen shook his head in disagreement. “The detour is just as dangerous. Our group is too large, and we have heavy supplies and women with us, so we can’t move fast. Meanwhile, the enemy is made up of highly skilled and mobile experts. It’s only a matter of time before they locate and catch up to us.”

Chu Xianglong chuckled. “That’s why we must abandon the carriages, horses, and part of the heavy supplies. We’ll travel light and stay off the official roads, engaging them in guerrilla tactics.”

One hated to admit it, but it was a smart decision.

Though the enemy consisted of skilled experts, infiltrating deep into enemy territory for ambushes meant that they couldn’t bring an army. This would leave them undermanned and incapable of conducting large-scale searches.

At this moment, Chu Xianglong truly demonstrated the qualities of an experienced general.

Situations like this weren’t uncommon in military campaigns, especially during retreats under pursuit.

Everyone turned to Xu Qi’an.

*Not bad. To reach the position of Deputy General under the Zhenbei King, one couldn’t be mediocre.* Xu Qi’an also felt that Chu Xianglong’s plan was the best option under the circumstances.

“No objections from me,” he said flatly.

Chu Xianglong smirked, casting a challenging and disdainful glance at Xu Qi’an, as if to say: _Still too young, kid. Watch and learn._

Without further delay, the officials left the tent, gathering their men and issuing orders to prepare for a night-time march.

Chu Xianglong roused the maids and then approached the princess’s carriage. Bowing deeply, he said, “Princess consort, we have a situation.”

A few seconds later, a calm female voice came from inside the carriage. “What is it?”

“The ship was ambushed on the river and sank. We are still in danger, and the enemy will likely pursue us. I’ve decided to take the mountain roads to evade them. Please prepare to depart immediately,” Chu Xianglong said in a low voice.

The maids, rubbing their eyes as they disembarked from the carriage, gasped in alarm at the news.

An old maid, disguised among them, shrank back in fear, her face pale and her expression panicked.

The princess remained silent. After a moment, the sound of movement came from within the carriage.

The old maid hurried back into the carriage to pack food and supplies, driven by an intense survival instinct. The other maids quickly followed suit, busily preparing.

…

Abandoning part of their supplies, the group carried only food and water as they left the official road. Crossing fields, plains, and mountains, they embarked on a grueling journey.

Yang Yan led the group at the front while Xu Qi’an and the imperial guards covered the rear.

At dawn, the group stopped at the foot of a mountain to rest briefly, replenish their food, and recover their strength.

Xu Qi’an gnawed on a bland pancake, drank some water, and silently thanked himself for not bringing along his beloved mare. Otherwise, his treasured steed would have been left behind.

Soft footsteps approached. Looking back, he saw the tired face of the old maid.

She hesitated for a moment before meeting Xu Qi’an’s gaze. Gritting her teeth, she walked over and sat down beside him. In a low voice, she asked, “Will we reach the northern border safely?”

Xu Qi’an replied, “You’re a servant of the royal household. That’s a question you should be asking Chu Xianglong.”

*I don’t trust him…* she hugged her water flask, her worried gaze sweeping over the group as she whispered, “I’m scared.”

Fear had driven her to seek out Xu Qi’an. Perhaps in her heart, the one who gave her a sense of security in this envoy group wasn’t Gold Gong Yang or Chu Xianglong, who was loyal to the Zhenbei King, but the young Nightwatcher who had been teasing her along the way—the Silver Gong who had shone brightly during the buddhist contest, the man who had subdued both Heaven and Man on the Wei River.

“Are you afraid of dying?” Xu Qi’an asked, his face expressionless.

She nodded, then shook her head.

“Chu Xianglong’s plan is solid. With some luck, we’ll reach Jiangzhou safely. Once there, we’ll be secure. Besides, what do you have to fear as a mere maidservant? If things look bad, just run. Do you think a fourth rank expert would bother chasing after you?”

Xu Qi’an mocked her for her cowardice.

“I’m afraid I won’t make it to Jiangzhou…” she sighed.

After just two hours of the night march, her legs were already weak and she could hardly keep up.

“Want me to carry you?” Xu Qi’an offered.

She shook her head.

“If… if the pursuers catch up to us, will you…” She changed her wording. “Will the nightwatchers protect the princess consort?”

Her hopeful gaze sparkled like starlight, as though Xu Qi’an’s affirmation would be enough to ease her worries.

“Of course not,” Xu Qi’an bluntly replied.

“We’re here to investigate, not protect the consort. Her survival isn’t our concern. If the enemy proves too strong, we’ll just escape. Their target is her, after all.”

“I see…” Her eyes dimmed as she silently rose and returned to her place, hugging her knees.

Among the crowd, she seemed lonely and pitiful, out of place.

…

A quarter of an hour later, Chu Xianglong stood and called out, “Move out!”

The well-trained imperial guards and attendants silently rose, hoisting their packs, readying their weapons, and preparing to march.

As the words left Chu Xianglong’s lips, Xu Qi’an suddenly felt his hairs stand on end. The next moment, an image appeared in his mind—above them in the mountain forest, a massive boulder was rolling down.

Almost simultaneously, Yang Yan, at the front of the group, jerked his head upward, his gaze locking onto the mountain behind them.

_Boom!_

A boulder, nearly twenty feet tall, crashed down from the mountainside, hurtling toward the core of the group.

The other martial artists in the envoy reacted a beat slower. It wasn’t until the boulder was already airborne that they sensed the danger. Ordinary soldiers and maids, meanwhile, had still not realised their impending catastrophe.
