# 370. Movement on All Sides

Dusk. The setting sun was like blood.

Xu Qi’an found himself before a sumptuous feast. Around the table sat a gentle-looking elderly woman, a young man, a delicate young lady, and two children of different ages.

*These are Zheng Xinghuai’s family... I’m experiencing this from Zheng Xinghuai’s perspective, reliving his memories…* Having experienced this type of channelling once before, Xu Qi’an immediately grasped the situation.

He quietly listened to Zheng Xinghuai admonishing his son.

Zheng Xinghuai had two sons. The elder pursued an official career and, thanks to Zheng Xinghuai’s guidance, was highly regarded and had a promising future.

The younger, however, was a wastrel, spending his days idling and engaging in frivolous pastimes. Yet, due to Zheng Xinghuai’s strict upbringing, this younger son dared not commit heinous acts, not even managing to be a proper hedonistic son.

A good-for-nothing.

Today, the second son had gone drinking at a brothel and gotten into a conflict with a military officer, resulting in a severe beating.

Zheng Xinghuai scolded his younger son with stern words.

The second son retorted indignantly, “Father, all I did was visit a brothel. It was that brute who started it! How am I in the wrong?”

*Yes, visiting a brothel isn’t a crime.* Xu Qi’an silently sided with second young master Zheng.

“Father, I wish to return to my parents’ home next month for my father’s sixtieth birthday,” the daughter-in-law interjected.

Before Zheng Xinghuai could reply, the second son waved his hands frantically, saying, “Are you mad? The barbarians have been wreaking havoc outside the city, and Chuzhou is so close to the border. If you leave recklessly, what will you do if you encounter barbarian raiders?”

Fear etched his face as he scolded his wife for her ignorance.

Zheng Xinghuai roared, “You coward! How could I have a son as worthless as you?”

Though Xu Qi’an couldn’t see Zheng Xinghuai’s face, in this empathetic state, he could feel Zheng Xinghuai’s exasperated anger, both disappointed and helpless with his second son, who he thought didn’t hold a candle to his elder brother.

At that moment, a man clad in light armour rushed into the hall. Carrying a horned bow on his back and a longsword at his waist, it was Li Han.

Li Han exclaimed urgently, “Sir, the troops of the garrison have inexplicably entered the city and begun rounding up the citizens. I don’t know what they’re planning.”

Zheng Xinghuai was startled and confused, asking, “The garrison troops are gathering citizens? Where are they being taken, and who is leading them?”

*Gathering citizens for a massacre?* Xu Qi’an’s heart skipped a beat as he sharpened his focus, listening intently as Li Han replied, “The people are being herded to four directions—north, south, east, and west. Leading the effort is the Commander General, Duke Protector Que Yongxiu. He’s likely at the southern district.”

Zheng Xinghuai put down his chopsticks, stood, and said, “Prepare my horse. I must see this for myself. Inform Mr. Zhu to accompany me.”

Immediately, Zheng Xinghuai, accompanied by his household’s “retainers,” mounted his horse and rode to the southern city. Along the way, he indeed saw garrison soldiers escorting citizens, forming large groups, but their destination was unclear.

“Stop! What are you doing?” Zheng Xinghuai shouted angrily.

The soldiers, clad in heavy armor, looked at him coldly without a word.

Zheng Xinghuai repeated his question, but still, no one responded.

A foreboding feeling rose within him. Without wasting more time arguing with the rank-and-file soldiers, he whipped his horse into a gallop, following the trail to the southern city.

Following the soldiers along the way, Zheng Xinghuai soon arrived at his destination—a vast, open field at the southern city, crowded with countless heads. A rough estimate suggested tens of thousands of people.

There were commoners, merchants, even clerks from the constabulary. This throng of people had been herded into the open area, shoulder to shoulder.

Surrounding them were thousands of heavily armored soldiers, armed with bows, crossbows, and blades, forming an impenetrable blockade.

Zheng Xinghuai’s gaze fell on the commanding figure astride a horse, Que Yongxiu, the Commander General, surrounded by a dozen black-clad spies.

*The Zhenbei King’s spies…* Zheng Xinghuai narrowed his eyes and asked sharply, “Duke Protector, what is the meaning of this?”

“Administrator Zheng, you’re just in time,” Que Yongxiu said coldly, his lone eye gleaming as he continued, “Administrator Zheng, do you know why the barbarians have repeatedly invaded our borders, pillaging and murdering?”

Zheng Xinghuai frowned, confused, and replied, “What does this have to do with gathering citizens?”

Que Yongxiu raised his spear, pointing it at the tens of thousands of gathered citizens, and laughed, “Of course, it’s related. As citizens of the Great Feng, it is their duty to lay down their lives for the stability of our borders. Administrator Zheng, don’t you agree?”

“What nonsense…”

Before Zheng Xinghuai could finish rebuking him, Que Yongxiu spurred his horse forward, charging into the crowd.

“Thunk!”

The spear pierced through the chest of a citizen, lifting him high as blood splattered. The man writhed in agony for a moment before going limp.

The scene erupted into chaos as the surrounding citizens screamed in terror. Those further away, unaware of the bloody act, remained bewildered.

Zheng Xinghuai’s eyes burned with fury. “Que Yongxiu! How dare you slaughter innocents? Have you lost your mind?”

*The massacre is beginning…* Xu Qi’an had anticipated what would follow. Through the empathy, he deeply felt Zheng Xinghuai’s shock and anger.

“Don’t worry, Administrator Zheng. Your turn will come soon.” Que Yongxiu flicked the corpse off his spear and waved his hand. “Loose the arrows!”

Thousands of soldiers drew their bows in unison, aiming at the helpless citizens.

“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”

Arrows rained down like a storm, a dense swarm of death.

Every arrow claimed a life. Common people fell one after another, their anguished cries echoing through the air as life was snuffed out like weeds. Amongst them were elders and children, none were spared.

Those lucky enough to survive the first volley of arrows tried to flee, only to be met with the blades of soldiers. These troops, meant to defend the Great Feng, showed no hesitation in butchering their own people.

“Help! Help…”

“Mercy! Mercy, please!”

Panic engulfed the citizens as they knelt and begged for mercy, unable to comprehend why the soldiers of Great Feng, their supposed protectors, were killing them instead of fighting the barbarians.

Sching!

Blades fell, bodies collapsed, and blood sprayed on all sides.

The soldiers showed no trace of pity for the kneeling and pleading crowd.

“You bastards! What are you doing? I am a student of the prefectural academy, a xiucai. Killing innocent civilians is a heinous crime!”

A young man dressed in azure scholar’s robes, his face pale but resolute, stepped forward to shield the people, shouting sternly at the soldiers.

Nearby, a squad leader drew his blade with a metallic clang and ruthlessly drove it into the scholar’s chest.

Warm blood trickled along the blade, and the scholar locked eyes with his killer, staring unflinchingly...

Xu Qi’an felt his soul quiver. He wasn’t sure if the feeling stemmed from himself, from Zheng Xinghuai, or perhaps from both.

“Kill everyone. Leave no survivors,” commanded Que Yongxiu, raising his spear.

No survivors—this included Zheng Xinghuai himself.

A group of black-robed spies unsheathed their weapons, charging toward Administrator Zheng with murderous intent.

Zhu, one of his retainers, steadied his stance, his fists igniting with an aura resembling transparent flames that distorted the air. He thrust a powerful punch forward.

One of the black-robed spies did not retreat but advanced, claw-like fingers tearing through the incoming force, dissipating it into a violent gust.

“Go now, my lord!” Zhu shouted, staying behind to hold them off while the other guards escorted Zheng Xinghuai back toward the Zheng residence.

Galloping at full speed, Zheng Xinghuai glanced back one last time. He saw soldiers nocking arrows and loosing volleys that pierced through the huddled civilians. He saw blades cutting down a mother fleeing with her child in her arms. And above it all, he saw Que Yongxiu sitting atop his horse, his lone eye observing the slaughter with icy indifference.

Their lives as worthless as the weeds on the road.

*Animals…* Xu Qi’an heard the thought, unclear if it came from himself, from Li Miaozhen, or from Zheng Xinghuai.

The soldiers along the way ignored them, mechanically and emotionlessly herding more civilians toward designated gathering points.

Zheng Xinghuai knew exactly what awaited those people. Several times, he ordered his guards to attempt a rescue, but each time, they refused. They focused solely on escorting him safely back to the estate.

“I’ll gather the household guards. You must immediately notify the madam and young masters. We must leave the city now and fight our way out!” roared Li Han, the man with the horned bow strapped to his back.

Before long, the estate’s guards assembled in the front courtyard. They carried weapons and armor but had no time to bring any valuables.

“Father, Father… what’s happening? Is it the barbarians? Have they invaded?”

Zheng’s second son stumbled out with the women of the household, his face pale and his eyes filled with terror.

“The soldiers in the city have mutinied. They are slaughtering civilians, and we are among their targets. We must flee the city at once,” Zheng Xinghuai said curtly.

Even at this moment, Zheng Xinghuai remained bewildered. He could not fathom why Que Yongxiu and the Zhenbei King would gather and massacre civilians or what purpose such atrocities served. But his years of navigating officialdom told him this was not the time to seek answers. The priority now was to escape Chuzhou City and reach safety.

Zheng’s second son swayed on his feet, nearly collapsing, and it was his wife who caught and steadied him.

Everyone had long grown used to his cowardice, including Zheng Xinghuai.

With the women and children loaded into carriages and the men on horseback, the group raced toward the city gates.

“They’re catching up!” Li Han yelled as black-robed spies closed in, their speed far surpassing that of horses. Turning mid-gallop, Li Han drew his bow to full tension and released an arrow with a sharp twang.

The spies dodged the arrows with ease, closing the distance in the blink of an eye. They leaped, blades drawn, aiming for the carriages.

“Protect the madam!”

Wei Youlong, clad in a violet robe, swung his saber upward, parrying the strike of one spy. The clash of Qi sent a shockwave through the air, nearly shattering the carriage.

The group fought as they fled, eventually reaching the city gates.

Before them stood hundreds of heavily armed soldiers, waiting in formation. On the walls, even more soldiers loomed, poised for battle.

Que Yongxiu, the commander, sat atop his horse, smirking coldly at the fleeing party. “Administrator Zheng, you can’t escape.

“The city walls are guarded not only by elite troops but also by the Zhenbei King’s personally trained top-tier experts. No one can get out.”

*It’s hopeless. With the gates closed, an army stationed above, and elite experts defending, even a barbarian horde would struggle to break through…* Xu Qi’an felt a sinking despair.

Immersed in the scene, he shared Zheng Xinghuai’s torment and anxiety. Rationally, he knew that the Zheng family could not escape this doom.

Zheng Xinghuai pulled his horse to a halt, shouting, “Que Yongxiu! What is the meaning of this? Are you rebelling?”

Que Yongxiu sneered. “Against you ants? There’s no need for rebellion.”

His single eye glinted with malice as he raised his spear and bellowed, “Kill them!”

Caught between the wolves ahead and the tigers behind, the situation turned desperate. Though the guards fought valiantly to protect Zheng Xinghuai and his family, the chaos of the battle left no room for their survival.

In the fray, the carriage overturned, and the women were cut down. Que Yongxiu thrust his spear, impaling Zheng Xinghuai’s youngest grandson. Laughing cruelly, he sneered:

“Administrator Zheng, you pride yourself on being an incorruptible official, uncompromising in your principles. Two years ago, you humiliated Prince Huai and relentlessly investigated the military land scandal, executing three of my most trusted subordinates. Did you ever consider this day would come?

“Killing your family is simply reciprocity. Here, catch.”

He hurled the child’s corpse at Zheng Xinghuai as a diversion. As the governor instinctively reached out to catch it, Que Yongxiu hurled his spear.

The spear pierced flesh, and pinned its target to the ground.

But it wasn’t Zheng Xinghuai.

The one struck was his cowardly second son.

Second young master Zheng, the timid and ineffectual man, raised a pale face to his father, choking out his final words: “Dad, it hurts… I… I’m so scared…”

He was still that useless coward, even now crying out to his father.

Yet, this coward had pushed his father aside in the moment of crisis, using his own body to shield him from the spear. He hadn’t even blinked.

He feared his father, lived meekly under his shadow. But in his heart, his father was the heavens, more important than anything else.

Xu Qi’an felt tears blurring his vision and a burning in his eyes. Instinctively, he reached to wipe his face, only to remember that he was merely an observer. The tears belonged to Zheng Xinghuai.

The shared memory shattered, fading into fragments. The last image Xu Qi’an saw was Que Yongxiu’s feral grin.

…

He jolted awake, opening his eyes to the sound of Zheng Xinghuai's heart-wrenching sobs. The vivid memory of his family’s gruesome deaths had shattered Administrator Zheng’s composure, forcing the empathy link to end prematurely.

The weeping, fierce and unrestrained at first, gradually softened into low wails. Much later, Zheng Xinghuai wiped his tears meticulously with his sleeve, his bloodshot eyes revealing his sorrow. Bowing, he said, “This official lost his composure.”

“My apologies.”

Xu Qi’an clasped his hands in a returning salute, letting out a long breath. “And what happened next?”

Li Han, the archer, answered in a deep voice, “We sacrificed two Rank-Four experts to fight our way out of the city. Afterward, we remained fugitives, hiding and seeking out men of honour to expose the Zhenbei King’s conspiracy.”

*So, apart from Zheng Xinghuai himself, his entire family perished in Chuzhou City...* Xu Qi’an cast a glance at the group, his voice low. “I need some fresh air.”

The atmosphere in the cave was unbearably stifling, and the carbon dioxide from the fire seemed to make breathing harder. Xu Qi’an felt an oppressive weight in his chest. Ignoring the others’ reactions, he walked to the entrance, pushed aside the branches obscuring the opening, and stepped out.

Standing in the valley, he drew deep breaths of the cool night air, only to realise the suffocating sensation had nothing to do with the air. It was the bitterness in his heart, anger unvented, and frustration unresolved.

Soft footsteps approached from behind.

“I’m going to Chuzhou,” Li Miaozhen said in a low voice.

The greatest hatred was silent. 

Her face was calm, unreadable, yet her gaze carried unshakable determination.

“It’s right to go, but rage without reason only blinds. Before heading out, let’s review the case of Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles,” Xu Qi’an said, snapping a dried branch and biting on it.

“The Zhenbei King slaughtered the city to refine the blood essence necessary to break through to second rank. Refining blood essence requires time, so he chose to massacre Chuzhou City, hiding it under the cover of familiarity. When I captured one of the Zhenbei King’s spies earlier and questioned their spirit, they knew nothing about the slaughter’s location. But from Administrator Zheng’s memories, many soldiers and spies participated in the massacre.”

Li Miaozhen frowned. “You mean those soldiers and spies likely had their memories altered?”

Xu Qi’an nodded. “Or perhaps they were unaware of what they did. Either way, it’s beyond the capabilities of martial artists. The Zhenbei King has an accomplice—an elite from another system aiding him.

“That individual likely has the power to restore Chuzhou City’s “original form”. I’m uncertain of their exact background, but northern territories are infiltrated by many barbarians investigating this matter. The Zhenbei King must be aware. He either halted refining the blood essence or is completely confident. Either way, given our strength, we can’t act rashly.

“Miaozhen, I need you to relay this information. Pass it to the barbarians, and to the Yao tribes.”

Li Miaozhen nodded. She could fly on her sword, making her ideal for delivering messages.

Meeting her gaze, Xu Qi’an said, “I’ll stay here to protect Administrator Zheng and wait for your return. Then, we’ll head to Chuzhou together.”

Li Miaozhen exhaled lightly. “You must wait for me.”

“Time is of the essence—go quickly.”

“Alright.”

Summoning her flying sword, Li Miaozhen leapt gracefully onto the blade, hovering midair.

Xu Qi’an returned to the cave, drawing the attention of Zheng Xinghuai and the others. He said gravely, “Administrator Zheng, everyone, please wait here for my news.”

Zheng Xinghuai seemed to sense something, asking hastily, “What are you going to do?”

“I’m heading to Chuzhou to investigate.”

There was no objection to this; the group nodded slightly.

Xu Qi’an’s gaze swept over them. “The way you’ve stayed by Administrator Zheng’s side and protected him is admirable. It’s men like you who make this world worth living in, who inspire hope.

“I promise you all, I will bring the perpetrators to justice and bring peace to Chuzhou’s people.”

Zheng Xinghuai stood and bowed deeply. “If so, this official can die without regrets.”

Li Han and the others clasped their hands in unison. “Die without regrets.”

…

At dawn, Xu Qi’an arrived at a small county town and checked into the finest inn.

After paying, he asked the attendant for a bucket of water, closed the door, and took out the fragmented Earth Book. With a flick of his hand, the unconscious princess consort tumbled onto the soft bed.

“Wake up...”

He lightly tapped her cheek but quickly remembered he had drugged her earlier. With a sigh, he circulated his qi to forcibly wake her.

The princess consort murmured and blinked dazedly. As her focus returned, her face froze in alarm. Like a startled rabbit, she shrank to the corner of the bed, eyes darting around in panic.

“You, you, you—what did you do to me?!” she demanded, her bravado feigned but unconvincing.

Xu Qi’an stifled a laugh at her reaction, feeling oddly at ease. Shrugging, he replied, “Nothing. I just made you sleep.”

“I don’t believe you! You knocked me out—you must have done something indecent!” she fumed.

*For heaven’s sake, you’re a grown woman. Wouldn’t you know if something happened to you?* Xu Qi’an mocked inwardly but said plainly, “I’ll step outside. Check for yourself.”

After a moment, the princess consort’s timid voice called, “Xu?”

He re-entered to find her seated at the dressing table, brushing her hair. Casting him a sidelong glare, she muttered, “Why knock me out if you didn’t do anything?”

Apparently satisfied with her self-check, her anger had mostly subsided.

Xu Qi’an fetched the bucket, pouring water into a copper basin before adding a vial of red liquid. He plunged his face into the mixture, scrubbing vigorously.

Fifteen minutes later, his face burned as he lifted it from the basin. When he raised his head, he was a different man.

This man was so handsome, he could stop a conspiracy in its tracks with a glance, so dashing that it made the heavens blush… at least, that’s what he thought.

He pushed aside the princess consort, looking at the familiar face in the mirror, mind wandering.

A long while later, he muttered: “Long time…”

The princess consort examined him: “Who’re you disguised as? Though such a plain face is great for staying inconspicuous.”

As soon as she had finished, she felt Xu Qi’an’s murderous glare.

Xu Qi’an shot her a murderous glare. You wouldn’t know handsome if it hit you.

*What the hell do you know about handsome?* Xu Qi’an didn’t look back at that godforsaken princess consort, saying lightly: “I’m heading out to investigate. I can’t easily take you with me, so I have to resort to this strategy.”

Pausing, his voice turned solemn. “Zhenbei King slaughtered Chuzhou City.”

*Clatter!*

The wooden comb fell to the floor. The princess consort snapped out of her daze, her face an intricate tapestry of shock and sorrow. She lowered her voice unconsciously, murmuring, “Chu… Chuzhou City?”

No matter who they were, such news was hard to believe at first hearing. The princess consort was no exception.

Xu Qi’an succinctly recounted the events involving Zheng Xinghuai.

The princess consort muttered to herself, “I’ve never liked him, and I detest how he and his brother treated me like a commodity to be traded. Yet, deep down, I still admired him. He is the foremost martial artist of Great Feng, a man of grand vision who defended the borders for the people of Great Feng for over a decade…

“I was wrong. He’s a selfish man. His defence of the borders wasn’t for the people—it was because the Great Feng belongs to his family, and he wouldn’t allow outsiders to plunder it.

“And the people, in his eyes, are mere possessions—things to be traded, sacrificed when necessary, without hesitation.”

She already knew that the Zhenbei King had massacred the common people, but hearing Xu Qi’an describe the slaughter in detail stirred her emotions uncontrollably.

The Zhenbei King’s atrocities were unforgivable, and Duke Protector Que Yongxiu deserved death by a thousand cuts. But as a Rank-Three martial artist and a king of the Great Feng, who could bring him to justice? Who could make him confess and accept punishment?

At that moment, she heard Xu Qi’an say, “I’ll be away for a few days. Stay here at the inn, and don’t go anywhere.”

As he spoke, Xu Qi’an placed his Earth Book fragment on the table. “Take care of this for me.”

If Shenshu were to be fully unleashed, all items in his possession—clothes included—might be lost.

The Earth Book fragment was too significant to risk losing. Ideally, he would’ve entrusted it to Li Miaozhen, but back then the princess consort was still stuck sleeping inside it. She wasn’t an object and couldn’t remain in the fragment indefinitely.

To prevent the “first beauty of the Great Feng” from starving to death, he resorted to this measure. Fortunately, the princess consort was an uninformed woman. To her, the Earth Book fragment was likely just a crudely made trinket.

The princess consort didn’t examine the jade mirror but instead stared at him and asked, “Where are you going?”

In that instant, images of commoners falling like grass, a scholar with a blade thrust into his chest, a mother clutching her child as they ran only to be struck down, and children impaled on spears flashed through Xu Qi’an’s mind. He recalled Zheng Xinghuai’s second son, nailed to the ground.

“I said I would punish the Zhenbei King. He doesn’t deserve the refined blood essense. I will make him and Duke Protector Que Yongxiu pay the price,” Xu Qi’an stated calmly, his face devoid of emotion but his gaze resolute. “I’m going to Chuzhou.”

The princess consort gazed into his eyes and knew she couldn’t stop him. She bit her lip and whispered, “You must come back. Promise me.”

“Alright.”

Xu Qi’an nodded, rising to leave.

“Xu Qi’an!”

She suddenly shouted, her unease evident as she stumbled over a chair in her haste to catch up to him. Summoning her courage, she recited,

“_A young man’s valour, brings heroes from five capitals old!_   
*With loyal heart, with just hand. With words of iron, life or death,*    
_A promise is worth a thousand tons of gold!_”

A promise is worth a thousand tons of gold—so you must return.

…

Tuotian Mountain.

The horn bellowed mournfully.

Two thousand elite cavalry from the Qingyan tribe gathered on the plains below the mountain. Mounted on scaled warhorses with single horns, they brandished curved blades, gazing toward the towering palace.

Amidst the horn’s wail, thunderous footsteps echoed in the distance.

A twenty foot tall azure giant emerged from the palace. Each step caused a slight tremor. In his hand, he dragged a massive sword that gouged a deep trench in the ground.

The cavalry watched their leader in silence. The scene was eerily still, save for the heavy footsteps.

The azure giant raised his colossal blade and bellowed, “In Chuzhou City!”

“In Chuzhou City!”

“In Chuzhou City!”

The cavalry roared in unison, raising and waving their blades in fervent response.

…

A black mountain in the north, its valleys shrouded in mist.

A white-robed arcanist stood at the cliff’s edge, gazing down. The valleys below were perpetually shrouded in dense fog, barren and devoid of life.

“Zhujiu.”

At the sound of the arcanist’s words, the fog began to churn, twisting like a dancer’s silken veils.

From the mist emerged a black silhouette, streaking toward the arcanist.

The fog parted to reveal an enormous snake head, entirely red and scale-less, with a tightly shut single eye on its forehead.

Its towering body rivalled a mountain peak, making the arcanist appear as insignificant as an ant in comparison.

Legends spoke of an ancient demon-god that ruled the icy northern lands. With a single eye, scaleless and red, it brought day when open and night when shut.

Zhujiu, leader of the northern Yao clans, was a descendant of that demon-god.

“In Chuzhou City,” the arcanist said with a smile.

The vertical eye on the serpent’s forehead abruptly opened, emitting a beam of golden light that pierced the clouds. The radiance could be seen from miles away.

…

On a precipitous cliff, beneath the gnarled roots of an ancient pine tree.

A stunningly beautiful woman with an enchanting smile stretched out her arm, her white sleeve slipping to reveal her delicate, jade-like forearm.

A black hawk spiralled down from the sky, landing gracefully on her arm, speaking in the human tongue: “The message has arrived. It’s in Chuzhou City.”

The breathtaking woman in white smiled faintly. “It seems he doesn’t just want the refined blood—he wants the Zhenbei King’s head. Pass on my orders. All Yao soldiers, advance on Chuzhou City.”
