# 209. The Dogmeat Store

The palace maid outside took the letter from the guard and handed it to the maid who had opened the door. She glanced at Princess Lin'an, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, looking sullen, and wisely retreated.

The maid who had once been playfully spanked by Xu Qi'an opened the letter and glanced at it. After reading the first line, she cleverly decided not to read further, having guessed who it was from. She covered her mouth and laughed, saying, “Your Highness, a letter from that running dog.”

Lin'an immediately turned her face, glanced at the two pages of the letter, and turned away again. “Too long; not reading.”

This was typical of Princess Lin'an's character. The two maids stifled their laughter, placed the letter on the desk, and softly said, “We’ll step out now, Your Highness. Call us if you need anything.”

Once the maids had left, Lin'an frequently looked toward the desk. When the sound of their footsteps had faded, she muttered to herself as she walked over to the desk and picked up the letter to read it.

She was still upset by what Huaiqing had said, feeling that the seemingly honest Xu Qi'an was actually a lecherous rogue who frequented the Jiaofangsi. The thought made her feel uneasy.

But she didn’t know the details, so she had been sulking ever since returning.

By rights, as *the* Princess Lin'an, she had many guards under her command, and she never concerned herself with their private lives.

She sat at the desk, straightened her back, and slightly lowered her head, her posture full of vitality and grace, a result of her training since childhood.

*The night is long, and I’ve no heart to sleep, Your Highness’s smile seems to appear before me, and your laughter echoes in my ears. It has been over a fortnight, and I miss you dearly.*

“Ugh!” Lin'an spat, but a smile tugged at her lips.

Such an informal opening fully expressed the writer's dependence and longing, highlighting her own importance. Princess Lin'an loved this kind of sentiment.

She was a romantic at heart, and had there been domineering CEOs in this era, she would have been a fervent fan of romance novels.

She continued reading, and the letter recounted many strange and thrilling events. For instance, there was an incident of attempted murder by a water ghost in the canal, and her running dog bravely jumping into the river to save him, fighting the ghost for three hundred blows to rescue a poor guard, who then gratefully knelt and kowtowed. But her servant lifted him up and said in a thunderous voice, “A man’s knees are like gold!”

*What a wonderful phrase…* Lin'an smiled, becoming more engrossed as she read.

She loved reading about these strange and bizarre events, which were both interesting and thrilling.

Outside, the two personal maids peeked through a crack in the door and saw Princess Lin'an sitting at the desk, completely absorbed, sometimes laughing softly, sometimes frowning, and at other times showing a frightened expression.

They quietly retreated and whispered to each other:

“Is the princess in a better mood?”

“Yes, it’s obvious… she’s reading the letter so intently.”

“Sister, what’s in the letter?”

“Don’t ask. We were taught in the palace not to pry into our mistress’s affairs.”

“That Xu Qi'an is truly something. The princess has only known him for a short while, yet she’s so taken with him... Well, I won’t gossip about it.”

…

Lin'an eagerly read to the end, where the story concluded, and Xu Qi'an mentioned a type of lotus in Qing Province called the Red Lotus, which was as brilliant as fire and always reminded him of her stunning appearance in a red dress...

As she read, Lin'an’s plump, jade-like face turned a shy red, looking enchanting.

Even though she knew no one was in the room, she still nervously glanced at the door and then clutched the letter tightly in her hand.

“He… he…”

Princess Lin'an heard her heart pounding in her chest, her oval face burning.

*How dare he write such a letter to me? Flirting with a princess like this, if it were to be discovered, he would be sentenced to death.* Thinking this, Lin'an wanted to tear up the letter to destroy the evidence.

But she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Since her birth, this was the first time she had received such a letter, full of exciting stories and beautiful words.

Her bright, dark eyes flickered with an idea. She placed the dried lotus petal and the letter together, hiding them in a thick book, a rare edition given to her by her mother.

“Now, no one will find it!” Lin'an sighed with relief, hands on her hips.

Soon, her two personal maids heard the princess call out, “Come in and help me change. I want to wear my red dress!”

The maids responded and entered the room, helping Princess Lin'an change into a beautiful, fiery red dress.

Lin'an nodded with satisfaction, spun around gracefully, and the skirt bloomed like a flower.

“Look at my stunning elegance!” she said, lifting her chin confidently.

The maids exchanged puzzled glances.

“Your Highness, aren’t you angry anymore?” the maid who had been spanked by Xu Qi'an tentatively asked.

“Angry about what?” Lin'an replied.

“That running dog,” the maid said, but as soon as she spoke, she saw Lin'an’s delicate eyebrows knit together, and she angrily interrupted,

“What running dog? How dare you call him that? You should address him as Master Xu.”

*My running dog is not for others to call,* she thought.

…

Reflecting Plum Pavilion.

Fuxiang, dressed in a white cotton gown, with her hair loose and unadorned, was picking plum blossoms in the courtyard with a bamboo basket.

The vibrant plum blossoms contrasted beautifully with the serene courtyard. Her intricate white gown trailed on the ground, and her snow-white wrists held the bamboo basket, which was gradually filled with clusters of plum blossoms. She raised her other hand to reach the branches.

The plum blossoms and the beauty complemented each other perfectly.

The maidservants in the courtyard found this scene delightful. Their lady had become more serene lately, spending her days practicing dance, playing the qin, and appreciating plum blossoms, engaging in refined activities.

She rarely showed herself at social gatherings and often left guests behind to have a drink or two before slipping away. The guests were not offended; on the contrary, they adored her even more.

Gradually, merely catching a glimpse of the oiran Fuxiang became something men bragged about for days.

After the poem “subtle fragrance drifts with the rising moon at dusk.” another poem had also gained popularity: “*Beauty draws the bead curtains red, lost in thought, brows a-furrowed…*”

The Jiaofangsi created a story to promote this poem:

The talented Sir Xu had made Lady Fuxiang cry, and in his desperation to cheer her up, he drank three cups of strong liquor. The alcohol inspired him to write this poem.

A poem without a story lacks soul, but once given a tale, it becomes a subject of endless discussion.

Many scholars believed this fabricated story, thinking Fuxiang to be a talent. They hoped that by associating with her, they too might write timeless poems like Xu Qi’an and achieve lasting fame.

This was the Great Feng’s version of hype and image-building!

However, since Sir Xu had left the capital, Lady Fuxiang often sighed and sent people every few days to inquire about his return.

At this moment, a young servant ran into the courtyard, holding a letter and waving it from afar:

“Lady Fuxiang, there’s a letter from Qingzhou, sent by Sir Xu.”

Xu Qi’an did not dare to sign his name on letters to the princesses, but he had no such reservations with letters to Fuxiang or his family.

Initially enthusiastic, Fuxiang was stunned for a moment, then dropped the bamboo basket and rushed forward, not waiting for the maid to deliver the letter.

She snatched the envelope from the young servant’s hand, her bright eyes sparkling like a girl receiving a surprise gift.

*Xu Lang actually sent me a letter...* Fuxiang’s heart overflowed with joy as she realized she held a special place in that man’s heart, beyond mere casual acquaintance.

This realization made her feel light-headed, almost dizzy.

“My lady...” a maid whispered, noticing the foolishly joyful smile on her face.

Fuxiang ignored her, lifting her skirt with one hand and holding the letter in the other, she quickly returned to her bedroom. She closed the door, impatiently opened the letter, and read it while walking to the bed, eventually sitting on the edge.

She bit her pink lips, reading each word slowly, afraid that if she read too quickly, it would be over too soon.

Seeing that Xu Qi’an had not visited the Jiaofangsi in Qingzhou, Fuxiang felt inexplicably happy. When he mentioned missing her and suggested she trim her nails, it took her a moment to understand.

“Ugh!”

Fuxiang blushed and tutted, hugging the letter to her chest like a treasure. She lay down on the bed, her plump lips curving into a joyful smile.

....

The letter to Sitianjian was received a bit late, coinciding with mealtime. Chu Caiwei, striving still to become a Master of Alchemy, felt that she had used up all her energy for the coming year too.

Next year, she planned to take it easy, postponing her attempts to advance to the next rank for a few years to avoid overworking herself.

Her once round, oval face had slimmed down, to the point where her chin started becoming pointed.

She was sitting in the dining hall with her senior brothers and sisters, about to have dinner. But before eating, she decided to read the letter from Xu Ningyan.

She felt a small surge of happiness.

*There’s a delicacy in Yuzhou called napa steamed ham — ham is a food unique to the south; it is difficult to find in the north…*

*Qingzhou also has several delicacies, I’ll list them out for you here…*

As she read, Chu Caiwei’s eyes widened, and she gulped down saliva. By the time she finished the letter, the usual food of Sitianjian seemed unappetizing.

She found it hard to swallow.

“Damn Xu Ningyan...” Chu Caiwei slapped the table, stood up in anger, and stormed out.

“Sister Caiwei, where are you going?”

“I’m going to Qingzhou, and Yuzhou too!”

“Huh?”

“To the restaurant! I refuse to eat Sitianjian’s lousy food anymore, it’s terrible!”

…

Just before dusk, Xu Lingyue returned home from school with Little Pea, followed by two strong servants.

Auntie, wearing a deep red silk dress and a pleated long skirt, was trimming the potted plants in the hall with scissors.

As the matron of the family, auntie found her role rather dull. The children were growing up and not yet married, so there were no troublesome daughters-in-law to contend with. Moreover, the Xu family was not populous, unlike those grand households bustling with people inside and out. Hence, the burden of managing the household was light.

She spent her days drinking tea, watering flowers, and occasionally taking the household servants out for a stroll.

The inner city was indeed more prosperous and safer than the outer city. She could walk the streets without fear of encountering bullies because the inner city had Nightwatchers patrolling, the Five Guard corps of the capital, and constables from the prefectural constabulary.

Even at her age, when she went out, men still stared at her in a daze, how bothersome.

Xu Lingyue entered the hall and saw her mother bending over to trim the plants. Her slender waist and the loose silk dress revealed a plump and full figure.

She felt a bit envious.

"Mum, I'm back..." Xu Lingyin, with a small cloth bag hanging around her neck, ran towards her mother. The bag swung back and forth as she ran, making her unsteady and causing her to bump into Auntie's rear.

"Stop being so noisy." Auntie turned around and scolded her.

After reprimanding the little girl, she looked at her elder daughter: "How did Lingyin perform in school?"

Little Pea had started school because Xu Xinnian decided on this requirement during his last visit home. It was not out of dissatisfaction but simply because he didn't want to see his younger sister waste her education.

So Xu Xinnian arranged for her to attend a well-known school in the inner city. The teacher was an old scholar, very strict in his teaching. Although he was well overqualified to teach children, the parents' generous payments made it worthwhile.

The children attending school with Xu Lingyin were not from ordinary families.

Xu Lingyue glanced at her carefree sister and sighed softly, speaking gently:

"The teacher said she reads the loudest and most earnestly during class, but she forgets everything after class. Today, she finally memorized three lines of the 'Three Character Classic'... the teacher was almost moved to tears."

Auntie felt embarrassed and poked the young girl's forehead with her finger: "Dummy, you need to use your brain when reading. Don’t let it go in one ear and out the other."

"I'm not a dummy, no, no, no," Xu Lingyin protested loudly.

"You are a dummy."

"Mother is the dummy because I came from you," Little Pea retorted.

"... " Auntie was speechless. She grabbed her and gave her a few smacks on the bottom. Xu Lingyin, with her thick skin, wasn’t afraid at all, still trying to prove she wasn’t a dummy.

Auntie sighed, deciding not to argue with the young girl. It only made her more exasperated without achieving anything.

"Your brother sent a few letters home, they’re on the table. Lingyue, you should take a look." Auntie was illiterate.

Xu Lingyue's eyes lit up, and she walked excitedly to the table, picking up the letters and scanning them. There were three letters, addressed to her, her father, and her mother.

"Mother, big brother sent you a letter too."

Auntie was surprised, her eyes glistening with delight, thinking her troublesome nephew still cared about her.

"I'll read it, I'll read it..." Little Pea, thinking she was now a scholar after a few days of school, insisted on reading the letters.

Xu Lingyue smiled and handed her the letter addressed to her father, then opened the one addressed to herself.

Little Pea took the letter, frowning at the many words: "Big brother is amazing, he can write so many words. His writing is better than mine."

"Obviously. Are you going to read it or not?" Auntie sat down.

"At the beginning, man’s nature is good. Their natures are similar..." she recited.

"Is that a letter? Did your brother write that?" Auntie was angry.

"This is the letter, I read it out," Little Pea insisted, flapping her arms like wings to emphasize her point.

"That’s just what you know, isn’t it?"

By then, Xu Lingyue had finished reading her brother's letter. She carefully kept the dried flower petal he sent, planning to put it in a scented sachet for safekeeping.

Her delicate face filled with a smile, she then opened the letter addressed to her mother: "Mother, let me read the letter from big brother."

Auntie immediately adopted a more relaxed posture, nodding with feigned indifference: "Mm."

"Please look after Lingyin well! End of letter." Xu Lingyue awkwardly smiled, "Big brother’s letters are concise and to the point…"

"He wrote that to make me angry on purpose," Auntie exclaimed, turning away in annoyance.

...

Xu Qi'an, along with Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao, donned casual clothes and carried only their swords. Before curfew, they left the inn and headed towards Huangbo Street.

They ordered a table of dishes at a small roadside restaurant, drinking and waiting for sunset. Xu Qi'an held a chopstick in his mouth and a wine cup in his hand, watching as the street grew quieter and the sky darkened.

When the last ray of sunlight disappeared in the west, he put down his wine cup, "Waiter, the bill."

Song Tingfeng watched as Xu Qi'an paid with silver nuggets and asked as they left the restaurant, "Ningyan, where do you get so much silver? I never see you use copper coins."

*Copper coins are beneath me, the child of fortune...* Xu Qi'an replied, "It's none of your business."

"No, I think that piece of broken silver looked familiar, it’s missing a corner... I lost three cash of silver yesterday, also missing a corner, could it be mine?" Song Tingfeng wondered.

"Be confident, drop the 'could be', it is your silver." Xu Qi'an patted his shoulder, "I found it by your door."

"You motherfuck... give me back my silver!" Song Tingfeng chased after him.

Soon, they arrived at Huangbo Street, one of the famous black markets in Baidi City. Unlike the deserted streets outside, this place was bustling with people.

However, everyone wore hoods or masks, hiding their identities.

The three donned black robes and hoods, hiding their swords under their robes, and entered Huangbo Street.

The strong smell of blood filled the air. The shops on both sides uniformly sold dog meat, with live dogs, cooked meat, and raw meat on display.

*I haven’t had dog meat in years...* Xu Qi'an was tempted.

After finishing their business, he planned to buy some dog meat to take back to the inn. Eating dog meat around a hotpot in the cold winter was a great pleasure in life.

Soon, they found shop Ding No. 15 by following the signboards. From the outside, it appeared to be another shop selling raw dog meat, but the keen-eared trio simultaneously heard the sound of women talking and laughing inside.

This was indeed a “dogmeat store”.
