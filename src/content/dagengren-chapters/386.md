# 386. Anger!

Rays of sunlight filtered through the bars into the dark and dreary prison, lighting up dust motes in the air.

Xu Qi’an stood there for a long time. Then, deciding he could not let Sir Zheng remain this way, he entered the cell and cut him down.

The corpse retained only a trace of warmth—he had been dead for some time.

Outside the cell, the High Court Deputy Justice wailed uncontrollably.

Xu Qi’an, however, did not feel particularly sorrowful. He merely thought that all in all, this was a form of release.

On the journey back to the capital from Chuzhou, he had watched as the scholar’s once-straight spine gradually bent, his figure growing ever more hunched.

He was exhausted. Burdened by the lives of 380,000 commoners, he dared not allow himself a moment’s rest. For as soon as he did, the suffocating tide of guilt would inevitably surge forth.

"Why did you do this to yourself? You were just a civil official without the strength to truss a chicken—you could accomplish nothing. Those 380,000 commoners never asked you to avenge them."

As Xu Qi’an arranged Zheng Xinghuai’s remains, he tried to close his eyes, but no matter how he tried, he could not. Those bulging eyes still stared unyieldingly at the turbid world.

"You toiled every day to persuade them, yet they only ever dismissed you with indifference. Back then, I wanted to say to you: The sorrows of mankind are not shared. They merely found you a nuisance.

"Oh Sir Zheng, the esteemed ministers of the capital did not, as you and I did, live through the Chuzhou massacre. They cannot see things as you do. Every year, there are disasters. Every year, countless people starve and freeze to death. To witness it first-hand and to read about it in a memorial—these are not the same.

"You barely survived the massacre in Chuzhou, rushing to the capital in the belief that the court would deliver justice to those 380,000 souls—to you. Yet in the end, you paid with your own life. Ha… ‘A scholar is of no practical use.’ Those words were not wrong in the least.

"I once risked my life for Administrator Zhang, thinking I would do the same for you. But before I could find a way, you were already gone. Perhaps this is for the best. Life is bitter indeed, and yours… was truly wretched."

Having finished his work, Xu Qi’an rose to his feet, took a few steps back, and deeply bowed to the pitiful yet admirable scholar.

Outside the dungeon, a group of heavily armed guards had gathered.

Bringing outsiders into the Constabulary was not necessarily a grave offence, but the dungeons were a restricted area. Without written orders from high-ranking officials such as the Chief Minister or Deputy Ministers, no one was permitted to enter at will.

The jailors had, of course, tried to stop him, but after Xu Qi’an kicked one flying, they did not dare resist any further and instead ran to inform the Chief Justice.

The Chief Justice stood at the front, hands clasped behind his back, with the Constabulary guards assembled behind him.

His expression was grim as he waited for a full quarter-hour before Xu Qi’an finally emerged. Unexpectedly, the young man was eerily calm, his face devoid of joy or sorrow.

"Xu Qi’an, you have trespassed into the High Court’s dungeons. Even if I were to execute you on the spot, Wei Yuan would have nothing to say about it," the Chief Justice barked, seizing the initiative.

The young man with the blade ignored him and walked away without a word.

This blade had been meant to kill beasts. It was only a moment too late. If anyone wished to test its edge, Xu Qi’an would not refuse.

"Minister Sir…" the Captain of the Guards murmured.

The Chief Justice was about to order his men to seize Xu Qi’an when he suddenly felt a tug at his sleeve. Turning his head, he found the High Court Deputy Justice staring at him intently.

"Sir, you have but one life. Why not cherish it?" the Deputy Justice said quietly.

A chill ran down the Chief Justice’s spine, his hairs standing on end.

—

The Imperial Palace. The Imperial Study.

Duke Protector and Duke Cao had returned to the palace to report.

"Your Majesty, Zheng Xinghuai is dead. The case may now be concluded," Duke Cao said respectfully.

"But how should we handle the other ministers?" Que Yongxiu still had some concerns.

The minsters had forgiven Zhenbei King only because he had perished. But now, he had returned to the capital, whole and unscathed. Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang would never let him go.

Emperor Yuanjing said calmly, "I will dispatch an Imperial Guard unit to your residence to ensure your safety. You need not worry about assassins. Furthermore, the spies who accompanied Zhenbei King back to the capital will remain under your command for the time being."

Only then did Que Yongxiu breathe a sigh of relief. With such a formidable security force, he would be safe from assassination.

As for the political infighting at court, he need only keep a low profile, neither fighting nor contesting. With the Emperor’s protection, not even Wei Yuan or Prime Minister Wang, for all their power, could touch him.

Once this storm passed, his future would still be bright.

With his worries dispelled, Que Yongxiu smiled in genuine relief.

"Your Majesty is wise and mighty. With this series of measures, you have shaken the resolve of the civil officials. Now, while they waver in hesitation, we sever Zheng Xinghuai’s path forward, forcing him to take his own life. The ministers will have no choice but to accept this outcome.”

*Of course, Your Majesty has also made enough concessions to satisfy certain parties. Otherwise, even you would struggle to hold firm.*

Que Yongxiu was thoroughly convinced of Emperor Yuanjing’s brilliance.

"The Sovereign Sword has been returned to the capital with the delegation, but that mysterious expert remains at large. If we could track him down and dispatch troops to eliminate him, we could avenge King Huai, bringing this matter to a perfect close," Duke Cao sighed.

Hearing this, Emperor Yuanjing’s expression darkened slightly. After a pause, he slowly said,

"The court assembly will be held tomorrow to put the Chuzhou case to rest. Before then, spread the news that Zheng Xinghuai took his own life in fear of his crimes."

Duke Cao smiled. "Yes Your Majesty!"

—

The Cabinet.

After the Emperor’s informal study session concluded, Prime Minister Wang summoned the five Grand Academicians to discuss the aftermath of Zheng Xinghuai’s imprisonment.

"King Huai is dead—let it be. But Que Yongxiu was one of the butchers of the massacre. His Majesty’s actions are truly…" Grand Academician Qian Qingshu of Wuying Hall trailed off, sighing instead.

"We should think of a way to save Sir Zheng. A loyal minister like him should not suffer such an unjust fate," the Grand Academician of Jianji Hall said, a touch of impatience in his voice. "Zheng Xinghuai is just too stubborn. He was suited to governance in his province, but in court politics, he could accomplish nothing."

His tone was filled with both sorrow for his misfortune and frustration at his lack of guile.

"But it is precisely that which makes him admirable, is it not?"

The Grand Academician of the Eastern Pavilion, Zhao Tingfang, exhaled deeply and mused, “Does His Majesty not wish to vindicate the Zhenbei King? Does he not seek to preserve the royal family's dignity? Then let us agree to his wish—on the condition that we secure the exoneration of Zheng Xinghuai.”

“If Zheng Xinghuai is convicted, this case will be neatly concluded in His Majesty’s eyes. Would he truly agree?” The Grand Academician of the Jianji Hall asked angrily.

“Then we continue escalating!” Zhao Tingfang rapped his knuckles against the table with unwavering resolve.

The Prime Minister shook his head gently. “It is useless. The situation now is not what it was before. When the news first broke, the entire court was outraged. But now that the initial fury has passed, now that they have been granted their concessions, now that the massacre has been repackaged as a glorious triumph for the court, the choice before them is clear.”

Qian Qingshu, the Grand Academician of the Wuying Hall, sighed before asking, “Then what does the Prime Minister propose?”

The Prime Minister replied, “Que Yongxiu’s safe return to the capital will undoubtedly ignite some people's anger. We can covertly rally those individuals and have them submit a joint protest. But we must temper our demands.

“This morning, Que Yongxiu stood in the streets, blood petition in hand, publicly accusing Zheng Xinghuai. The entire city bore witness. If we now push for his complete exoneration, neither side will accept it, and His Majesty will certainly not agree.”

The Grand Academicians nodded slightly.

Indeed, with tensions inflamed to such a degree, attempting to whitewash Zheng Xinghuai would be absurd—not only would His Majesty refuse, but even the common people would struggle to make sense of it. Who, then, was truly in the right?

If mishandled, the court itself would become a laughing stock.

The Prime Minister sighed. “Zheng Xinghuai must still bear some measure of guilt, but we can resort to subterfuge—using a death-row convict in his stead. If His Majesty consents, the matter will be settled.

“All we can do now is spare his life.”

Though reluctant, the Grand Academicians had no choice but to nod in agreement.

Just then, a clerk rushed in, handing a slip of paper to the Prime Minister before swiftly retreating.

The Prime Minister unfolded the note, his expression freezing. He remained motionless for a long while.

“Zheng Xinghuai… has died in prison…”

The aged Prime Minister placed the note gently on the table, propped himself up with great effort, and left the chamber.

His departing figure was like that of an old man whose candle burned low, battered by the winds of time.

…

Nightwatcher Constabulary.

Sitting stiffly upright, Nangong Qianrou dared not utter a word.

Despite being a Rank Four martial artist, he found himself struggling to breathe in the oppressive silence.

And it was all because of the slip of paper just delivered.

From the moment he read it, Wei Yuan had not spoken a single word, nor shown the slightest flicker of emotion. He was as still as a statue.

Nangong Qianrou had followed Wei Yuan for many years, and he had rarely seen him this silent—silent like the calm before a terrible storm.

The message was simple: Zheng Xinghuai had been murdered in his cell.

So very simple.

A dignified Provincial Administrator, a civil servant of the second rank, and this was all that remained of him in the intelligence reports.

What would the annals of history say about him? Perhaps a few more words—colluding with the Yao and the Southern Barbarians, bringing about the deaths of 380,000 people, causing the downfall of the Great Feng’s pillar of national defence.

Infamy for all eternity.

*What a ridiculous world…* Nangong Qianrou sneered inwardly.

As an observer, he could only lament.

The absurdity lay not in the world itself but in its people.

The grand tomes of history overflowed with the names of men like Zheng Xinghuai.

And why were there so many such injustices?

In the end, it was because too few dared to stand up against them.

…

“Your Highness, the Second Princess requests an audience.”

When the captain of the guards knocked on Huaiqing’s study door, her mood was already foul. Hearing this, she frowned.

If Lin’an was here to provoke her, to vex her, she might lose control of her temper.

“Let her wait in the reception hall. We shall change into more presentable attire before going.”

Dismissing the guard, Huaiqing burned the slip of paper and donned a plain white gown, as pristine as freshly fallen snow. When she entered the reception hall, she was met with the sight of her younger sister clad in vibrant red.

She was immediately taken aback.

Lin’an had always been lively, radiant, and chattered endlessly like a little sparrow—one that would peck at you from time to time, only to be swatted to the ground with a casual flick of the hand.

Yet, no matter how many times she was struck down, she would tirelessly flutter back up to peck once more.

But the Lin’an before her now was like a withered flower, her delicate oval face dull and lifeless, her peach blossom eyes downcast—like a timid, helpless little girl.

“If you are here to ask whether Zheng Xinghuai is dead, then we can give you a clear answer: yes.” Huaiqing stated plainly.

Lin’an nodded, staring blankly at the floor. In a quiet voice, she murmured, “I… I don’t feel well… I don’t know why, I just… just feel uneasy, and very afraid…”

The weight of this event had struck her too deeply.

The Great Feng had known peace for many years. Before their uncle’s death, the imperial harem had been harmonious…

Huaiqing replied indifferently, “It is nothing significant. You simply lack knowledge. Read more history books, and you will understand—such things are commonplace. The more bloody and unjust an event, the fewer words it will receive in the records.”

“You… is that truly how you feel?” Lin’an stared at her.

She had been overwhelmed with guilt over Zheng Xinghuai’s death, over the 380,000 souls lost in Chuzhou. The weight of it was suffocating.

And so, she had thought of Huaiqing.

Huaiqing was the sister she had always sought to surpass. She wanted to see how Huaiqing faced all of this.

But now that she had, she felt only disappointment.

Huaiqing stepped closer, looking down at her. “When the moon waxes full, it begins to wane. When water reaches its brim, it spills over. All things follow the cycle of rise and fall.

“When a dynasty shifts from prosperity to decline, it is always accompanied by rivers of blood and tears. The rot within will slowly hollow it out. More events like this will come.”

Lin’an fell silent for a moment before raising her head to meet her sister’s gaze. “Then… what should be done?”

Huaiqing placed a hand atop Lin’an’s head, a rare warmth flickering in her eyes.

“In such times, there will always be someone who stands up.”

*Someone who stands up…*

Lin’an clenched her fists.

…

The Inner City, an inn, the main hall.

At a corner table, Li Miaozhen was dining with the woman who clung to her like an unwanted burden. She truly disliked this woman.

It wasn’t just because she always carried herself with an air of superiority. Over the past few days, this plain-looking woman had made some improvements—handling tasks on her own whenever possible.

The real reason Li Miaozhen disliked her was the arrogant sense of self-admiration in her eyes.

It was as if, in this woman’s view, all other women were mere withering flowers, while she alone was the one true beauty in the world.

Yet clearly, she was as plain as could be, so much so that men wouldn’t even spare her a second glance. The only exception was her well-rounded and perky hips, along with her full and firm bosom—so prominent that even several layers of clothing failed to conceal their size...

*Not that there’s anything to envy. A few extra pounds of flesh are nothing more than a hindrance to my crusade against evil...* Li Miaozhen consoled herself with this thought.

“Why hasn’t he come looking for me yet?” Mu Nanzhi muttered.

“Hah, you’ve been married before, and yet you still shamelessly long for another man?” Li Miaozhen sneered, inexplicably annoyed.

“I simply find your company dull.” The Princess Consort lifted her chin, responding haughtily.

“……”

*Where did this ridiculous arrogance come from? Did she not realise her own worth?*

Li Miaozhen was so irritated that her teeth itched. These past few days, her mood had been terrible because King Huai’s verdict had yet to be decided. And today, she had learned that Zheng Xinghuai had been imprisoned.

*One day, I will storm the imperial palace with my blade and carve Emperor Yuanjing into a thousand pieces…* Li Miaozhen seethed.

At that moment, a few people at a neighbouring table spoke loudly. “Did you hear? Zheng Xinghuai is dead. Turns out he was the real mastermind colluding with the Yao and the barbarian tribes.”

“What?!”

The entire hall turned to look, faces filled with shock.

The speaker continued confidently, “I have a brother working at the High Court. Today, he heard that Zheng Xinghuai committed suicide in his cell out of guilt.”

The hall immediately erupted into an uproar.

Such an unexpected twist!

The man went on, “Zheng Xinghuai was utterly vile! He colluded with the Yao and the barbarians, leading to the death of the Great Feng’s pillar of defence—Zhenbei King—and the massacre of 380,000 people in Chuzhou.

“Then he deceived the delegation and came to the capital to file false charges. Just how much hatred did he have for Zhenbei King? I heard that back in Chuzhou, he secretly embezzled military land and took bribes, for which Zhenbei King punished him multiple times. That’s why he bore a grudge.

“This time, his collusion with the Yao and the barbarians was because Zhenbei King had gathered evidence of his crimes and planned to impeach him before the court...”

At this point, the man even squeezed out a few tears, sighing mournfully. “We common folk may be powerless, but we still despise men like him. What a tragedy for Zhenbei King—a great hero who met such a miserable end.”

The diners were stunned, momentarily forgetting their meals as they launched into discussion.

“That can’t be right! The news of Zhenbei King’s massacre was brought back by the delegation—by Silver Gong Xu himself!”

“Yes! Silver Gong Xu is an unparalleled investigator—how could he have wrongly accused Zhenbei King?”

“We don’t believe it.”

“Hah, believe it or not, it doesn’t matter. Tomorrow, when the court issues its decree, you’ll have no choice but to accept it.”

“Pah! Unless Silver Gong Xu admits it himself, we refuse to believe it. We’ll wait for the official word tomorrow.”

With a soft clatter, Li Miaozhen’s chopsticks fell to the table.

*Xu Qi’an…* The Princess Consort’s heart sank. The first thought that came to her wasn’t anything else—it was that infuriating Xu Qi’an.

In her ears, his words seemed to echo once more: “I’m going to Chuzhou to stop him. If possible, I’ll kill him...”

…

That day, all across the capital, the rumour of Chuzhou Provincial  Administrator Zheng Xinghuai’s suicide spread rapidly. In the accounts of certain ill-intentioned individuals, Zheng Xinghuai had colluded with the Yao and the barbarians, orchestrating the death of Zhenbei King and the massacre of 380,000 people in Chuzhou.

Then, he had framed Zhenbei King, seeking to ruin the reputation of the Great Feng’s stalwart defender.

Faced with these rumours, some were shocked, some sceptical, and some utterly confused…

The common folk did not understand the intricacies of court politics, nor did they know whom to trust. In times of uncertainty, ordinary people instinctively sought a figure of authority.

And now, when it came to this case, the only person the common folk could think of was Xu Qi’an.

At that moment, however, he had just left Sitianjian.

The Jianzheng had once again refused to see him, but Xu Qi’an had no intention of seeking another audience. He had merely asked Caiwei to pass on a message.

Outside the Sitianjian tower, Hengyuan and Chu Yuanzhen were waiting for him.

The swordsman, with a single streak of white in his hair, smiled and asked, “Would you like to travel the jianghu with me?”

Xu Qi’an grinned. “Are the Western Region’s courtesans as soft and tender as they say?”

Chu Yuanzhen sighed helplessly. “I have long since renounced such indulgences.”

Xu Qi’an waved them off. “One day you’ll change your mind—but not today.”

He walked away alone.

Before dusk, Xu Erlang and Uncle Xu took the women of their family and left the city.

…

The next morning, court assembly.

The officials of the court stepped into Jinluan Hall. They did not have to wait long before Emperor Yuanjing arrived—he seemed eager for the session to begin.

Once Emperor Yuanjing had settled in his seat, the elderly eunuch stepped forward and announced, “Those with petitions, present. Those without are dismissed.”

No one spoke. But in that moment, countless gazes turned to the Chief Justice.

Bracing himself, the Chief Justice stepped forward and bowed. “Your Majesty, this humble official has a report.”

Since the man had died in the High Court’s custody, it fell to him to deliver the news.

Emperor Yuanjing’s lips curled into a smile. “Speak, my Lord.”

The Chief Justice paused briefly before proclaiming in a clear voice, “Chuzhou’s Provincial Administrator Zheng Xinghuai took his own life in prison at midday yesterday.”

Jinluan Hall fell silent.

Emperor Yuanjing’s smile deepened. “My Lords, how should this case be settled?”

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong stepped forward. “Since he has committed suicide in guilt, then the case of Chuzhou may now be concluded. Administrator Zheng Xinghuai, a native of Zhangzhou, passed the imperial exams in the nineteenth year of Yuanjing’s reign. This man colluded with the Yao and the barbarians, resulting in the deaths of Zhenbei King and 380,000 people of Chuzhou. His crimes warrant the extermination of his entire clan.

“Zheng Xinghuai has a son currently serving in Qingzhou. The court may issue a decree instructing Qingzhou Administrator Yang Gong to apprehend his entire family and execute them as a warning to all.”

Emperor Yuanjing surveyed the assembly and asked, “Do my ministers have any objections?”

Silence.

Emperor Yuanjing laughed. For years, he had employed the art of balance, ensuring that the court was fractured into rival cliques, preventing them from uniting.

And he remained supreme above them all.

His will was the highest authority of the Great Feng.

How laughable, that these people had dared to challenge the dignity of the imperial house, hoping to see it spat upon by the world?

Utterly laughable.

Among the gathered ministers, Duke Que Yongxiu could barely suppress his laughter, his face betraying unconcealed delight. Be it Wei Yuan, Prime Minister Wang, or any other civil officials—at the end of the day, they were mere subjects.

No matter how skilled they were, in His Majesty’s eyes, they were nothing more than that.

After this case, not only would he pass through unscathed, but he would also be rewarded for his merits. The noble title of Protector Duke, passed down through the generations, would finally rise to prominence once more in his hands.

His moment of joy was brief, lasting only until the elderly eunuch bellowed:

“Court is dismissed!”

Que Yongxiu knew then that the matter was settled. Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang were powerless to change the outcome.

The ministers left Jinluan Hall in hurried steps, as though they wished to linger no longer than necessary.

“Duke Cao, shall we visit the Jiaofangsi tonight? After so many years in the Northern Border, I’ve nearly forgotten the tenderness of the Jiaofangsi girls.”

In good spirits, Que Yongxiu struck up a conversation with Duke Cao.

Duke Cao frowned slightly. Someone of his status disdained visiting the Jiaofangsi—his household had no shortage of stunningly beautiful wives and concubines, and he could barely find time to favour them all.

However, seeing Que Yongxiu’s enthusiastic invitation, Duke Cao nodded. “Very well.”

Then he shook his head and advised, “You’d best not go out these next few days. Stay in your residence. If you desire the company of a Jiaofangsi woman, have her brought to the Duke Protector’s manor instead. Why trouble yourself to go in person?”

Que Yongxiu considered this and found it reasonable. “Then I shall host a banquet at my residence and invite some colleagues and friends. Duke Cao, you must grace us with your presence.”

“Naturally…”

Duke Cao agreed with a smile, but suddenly noticed that the civil officials ahead had come to a halt, gathering at the Meridian Gate without proceeding further.

A sense of foreboding crept over him. He lowered his voice and said, “Come, let’s see what’s happening.”

Que Yongxiu, confused, followed alongside him. Pushing through the crowd, he saw a man standing outside the Meridian Gate.

The man was clad in simple cloth garments, his stature tall and imposing. He leaned on a blade, blocking the ministers’ path.

Not far from him stood two figures—one in white, the other in red.

“Xu Qi’an, why are you blocking the Meridian Gate again? What do you intend to do this time?”

Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law instinctively shouted.

The civil officials glared at him in shock and fury. This scene was all too familiar, dredging up unpleasant memories in many minds.

Especially for Minister Sun—he had already been publicly humiliated twice by this blackguard’s scathing poetry.

Xu Qi’an? So he is the same Xu Qi’an involved in the Chuzhou Massacre case? The one Duke Cao mentioned as Zheng Xinghuai’s supporter? Que Yongxiu frowned. From the officials’ reaction, had this man obstructed the Meridian Gate before?

Xu Qi’an swept his gaze over the gathered officials, his expression calm.

“Which one of you is Que Yongxiu? And Duke Cao, step forward.”

Duke Cao’s frown deepened. His ominous feeling grew stronger.

“Hah! Such audacity. Does he think he’s here to insult me? Does he believe that having Wei Yuan as his backer and having insulted civil officials once before, he can do the same to me?”

Protector Duke Que Yongxiu sneered, his eyes cold. “Does he think I am like those civil officials, all bark and no bite?”

Duke Cao said gravely, “This man’s cultivation is not weak. Who knows what madness has possessed him?”

Que Yongxiu scoffed and suddenly remarked, “If I were to behead him here, do you think His Majesty would hold me accountable?”

Hearing this, Duke Cao chuckled. “As long as you provoke him into making the first move, his death is assured. Hmph, this brat has been running rampant in the capital, thinking himself invincible under Wei Yuan’s protection.”

“He simply hasn’t met me yet. I’ve fought countless battles on the battlefield. Teaching a lesson to an insolent fool like him is my speciality.”

Que Yongxiu smirked and strode forward with Duke Cao, coming to stand before the assembled officials. They faced the young man who stood motionless, gripping his blade.

Que Yongxiu taunted, “I am the one you seek. What now? Here to hurl insults? I hear Xu Qi’an is quite the poet. Come then, compose a verse for me—perhaps it will grant me lasting fame.”

He and Duke Cao burst into laughter.

Yet the young man before them did not move an inch. Finding the provocation insufficient, Que Yongxiu pressed on:

“Duke Wei, your disciple lacks proper discipline. Look at this unruly brat—storming the Meridian Gate without a care for the law. If you can’t teach him, perhaps I should do it for you?”

Wei Yuan remained silent, merely watching Xu Qi’an without expression.

Xu Qi’an let out a sigh. “I’m not here to insult anyone today. I’ve come to kill.”

Duke Cao and the surrounding officials’ faces changed drastically.

“Hahahaha…”

Que Yongxiu laughed wildly. “Listen to this! He says he’s here to kill. Right at the Meridian Gate!”

As he laughed, he suddenly noticed something amiss. He turned his head in bewilderment—only to see that the officials had all taken several steps back in unison.

Among them were the Ministers of the Six Departments, the Censors of the Six Divisions, and the esteemed scholars of the Hanlin Academy… These were some of the most powerful figures in the capital. And yet, they regarded a mere Silver Gong with such fear?

Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang had not moved. They watched him with cold, indifferent eyes.

*This…*

A chill ran through Que Yongxiu. He quickly glanced at Duke Cao, only to find that the man had already retreated more than ten metres.

His gaze swept over the officials once more. Only now did he notice something truly disturbing in their expressions—revulsion, disdain… and a trace of anticipation?

“Where are the Imperial Guards?! Guards! Seize this man at once!” Que Yongxiu roared.

From a short distance away, the Imperial Guards surged forward, encircling Xu Qi’an. Blades were drawn, spears were levelled.

Que Yongxiu waved his hand with practised authority. “This criminal openly threatens to commit murder in the palace! Arrest him at once and deliver him to His Majesty!”

The guards did not move.

“Why aren’t you taking him? Does my command mean nothing?” Que Yongxiu bellowed.

A hushed voice from within the crowd whispered, “He… he holds an imperial death pardon…”

Que Yongxiu’s eyes widened in shock.

Now, he understood. Understood why the officials had retreated. Understood why the Imperial Guards hesitated.

The Imperial Guards existed to protect the Emperor. Unless His Majesty’s life was in danger, they would not risk confronting a man holding an imperial pardon.

*What does it matter if he has an imperial pardon? I refuse to believe he dares to act within the palace…*

Que Yongxiu was not afraid. He himself was a Rank Five expert. Though he did not carry a weapon into court, he was far from defenceless.

At that moment, Xu Qi’an retrieved a piece of paper from his robe. With a flick of his wrist, he ignited it. His voice rang clear and commanding:

“Seal!”

In an instant, Que Yongxiu and Duke Cao’s bodies stiffened, frozen in place.

Xu Qi’an gripped his blade and stepped forward, one deliberate stride at a time.

Prime Minister Wang spoke in a deep voice, "Xu Qi’an, do not act recklessly. The Duke Protector is a First-rank Duke and a descendant of the founding nobles. If anything happens to him, you will not be able to bear the consequences."

Censor Zhang Xingying grew anxious. "Duke Wei, quickly stop him!"

Wei Yuan remained still.

As Xu Qi’an took a step forward, the civil officials instinctively stepped back, leaving Duke Cao and Duke Protector exposed.

_Crack… crack…_

He swung the scabbard, shattering the kneecaps of the Duke Protector and Duke Cao.

Though their bodies could not move, the pain was undiminished. Both men turned pale and let out wretched screams.

Que Yongxiu looked to the officials, crying out for help, "Stop him! Stop him! We serve the same court—you cannot just stand by and watch me die! A mere martial brute dares to kill at the Meridian Gate, and none of you will step forward? Do you wish to be ridiculed by scholars across the land?"

A newly appointed young official from the recent imperial examination was stirred by his words. He instinctively moved to intervene, only to be abruptly kicked back by Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law.

The Six Ministries’ ministers, vice ministers, the Censors of the Six Divisions—all those with the privilege to enter court—chose a tacit silence. Not a single person spoke.

Even those with grudges against Xu Qi’an remained quiet.

Que Yongxiu understood then. These scheming scholars intended to kill him with borrowed hands.

They all wanted him dead.

Xu Qi’an returned his blade to his waist and made a gesture no one understood. He raised his hand and beckoned towards the western sky.

Then, gripping Duke Cao and Duke Protector by their collars, he dragged them out of the palace.

…

In the imperial bedchamber.

Emperor Yuanjing had just returned to the Imperial Study after morning court when a guard rushed in, disregarding protocol, and shouted from the doorway:

"Your Majesty, Xu Qi’an is blocking the Meridian Gate again, claiming he will kill the Duke Protector and Duke Cao."

Emperor Yuanjing’s expression changed drastically, his fury erupting. "Does he seek rebellion?! What of Duke Cao and the Duke Protector?"

"They have already been taken out of the palace," the guard replied anxiously.

"Mobilise the Imperial Guards immediately! Stop Xu Qi’an! If he resists, execute him on the spot!" Emperor Yuanjing roared.

Once the guard had left, he stood by the grand desk, his face dark and uncertain.

He had suppressed Wei Yuan, suppressed Prime Minister Wang, and suppressed the entire court—yet he had overlooked this minor figure.

"He dares to defy Us… He is utterly reckless, utterly reckless…"

Emperor Yuanjing growled deeply, sweeping the documents, memorials, and writing implements off the desk in a fit of rage.

Still unsatisfied, he kicked the desk over.

…

Following the Emperor’s decree, experts among the Imperial Guards led hundreds of troops out of the palace, galloping wildly down the streets in pursuit.

They caught up with Xu Qi’an in the streets of the Imperial City.

"Stop him!"

One of the Imperial Guard captains, seeing the two Dukes still alive, breathed a sigh of relief before leaping from horseback, soaring towards Xu Qi’an.

_Whoosh!_

A flying sword suddenly shot forth, its brilliance dazzling.

The captain drew his blade to clash with the flying sword. Though unscathed, he was forced to halt.

Above, Li Miaozhen floated mid-air, her long hair fluttering, her delicate face frosted with cold anger.

She had left from Lin’an Manor, having spent the night in the city.

*The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect…* The captain was both shocked and furious. "I’ll handle Li Miaozhen! The rest of you, stop Xu Qi’an!"

More than one expert had been dispatched in pursuit.

At once, three more experts leapt from horseback, their qi surging as they soared through the air.

_Shing!_

A sword light flared, cleaving a deep trench before the three.

On a rooftop nearby stood a swordsman in azure robes, hands clasped behind his back, his smile cold.

"Chu Yuanzhen! Are you betraying the court? Do you wish to become a wanted criminal?" The three recognised him at once.

Chu Yuanzhen sneered. "This is the Imperial City, home to nobles and high officials. If you three wish to bear responsibility, then by all means, fight me. I, Chu, am a lone wanderer. At worst, I shall never step foot in the Great Feng again."

The three were furious, their teeth grinding in frustration.

The clash of auras here had stirred responses from within the city. Powerful presences awakened within noble estates—some were officials themselves, others harboured guest masters of no small skill.

And from within the palace, even stronger auras emerged—more experts on their way.

"I think we've kicked a hornet’s nest…" Chu Yuanzhen muttered through transmission.

"If you're scared, fuck off," Li Miaozhen snapped irritably.

"Amitabha!"

Naturally, Hengyuan could not be absent. He emerged from another street, his voice steady. "Lady Li, why did you not take me along?"

He, too, had infiltrated the Imperial City ahead of time, hiding in Lin’an manor. Li Miaozhen had simply not carried him while flying, so he had arrived a moment late.

Li Miaozhen scoffed, "We’ll talk about that when we're running for our lives."

…

Dawn had broken. The streets of the Inner City were coming alive with foot traffic.

Xu Qi’an stepped onto Li Miaozhen’s flying sword, soaring out of the Imperial City before landing lightly on the main street.

Then, still holding the two Dukes, he paraded them openly through the streets.

Passersby first noticed the two men dressed in the robes of Dukes.

"Eh? Isn’t that Silver Gong Xu? I barely recognised him without his Nightwatcher uniform!"

Someone called out in surprise.

"Who is he carrying? That—that’s a python robe! A high noble…"

"I recognise him! The one-eyed man—he’s Duke Protector Que Yongxiu, the one who entered the city yesterday."

"The very same Duke Protector who accused the Chuzhou Minister, Zheng Xinghuai, of colluding with the Yao and barbarians, leading to the death of Zhenbei King?"

Common folk rarely recognised Dukes, such as Duke Cao. However, the Duke Protector had been exceedingly ostentatious the previous day, leaving a deep impression on the Inner City residents.

They recognised him at a glance.

"Why is Silver Gong Xu carrying him? That’s a Duke! What’s happening?"

"Who cares? What Duke is he again? This must be about the Chuzhou case! I’m going to fetch my wife so she can see this!"

"Dearest, watch the stall for me! I’m going to follow and see what’s happening."

"But husband, I want to see too…"

Onlookers pointed and whispered, their curiosity piqued. Some abandoned their businesses entirely, following along.

It wasn’t just blind excitement. The moment involved Silver Gong Xu, and the fact that he was carrying the Duke who had strutted through the city yesterday—no one could resist their curiosity.

The crowd gathered, growing ever larger.

Soon, it became a surging tide of people.

This was what Xu Qi’an wanted. Killing Que Yongxiu with a single slash would have been satisfying, but it was not the outcome he sought.

At last, dragging two dukes behind him, he arrived at the execution ground at the Vegetable Market.

The execution ground was set up at the Vegetable Market primarily because of the large crowds. The purpose of a public beheading was to make an example of the condemned—without an audience, how could it serve its purpose?

The people at the Vegetable Market immediately noticed Xu Qi’an—or rather, they noticed the surging tide of people rushing in.

"W-what's going on?" The common folk at the Vegetable Market were stunned.

"Isn't that Silver Gong Xu?"

The marketplace swelled with people.

Xu Qi’an tossed Duke Cao and Duke Protector onto the execution platform, then drew his blade and severed the tendons in their hands and feet.

Next, he grabbed each of them by the hair, forcing their heads up. Smiling, he said, "Look at all these people. Good day to die today."

Que Yongxiu's face turned deathly pale with fright. "I—I am a first rank Duke, a descendant of the founding nobles! You—you cannot kill me! If you do, there will be no place for you in Great Feng!"

This Commander of the battlefield, despite the situation, still retained a soldier’s composure. He said urgently, "Do not make another mistake! I am not dead yet—everything can still be salvaged! I will plead with His Majesty to grant you mercy. I swear—"

He still had a bright future ahead. He had just achieved victory in the court. He could not die like this.

Xu Qi’an merely smiled.

Duke Cao's terror exploded. He kowtowed frantically, his head striking the platform like pounding garlic. "Silver Gong Xu, I was wrong! Please, I beg you, let me go! Let me go... It was Duke Protector Que Yongxiu and His Majesty! They were the ones behind the massacre! It was them, it was them!"

"Silence!" Que Yongxiu bellowed.

"It is you who should shut up!" Duke Cao's face twisted with rage. "You don’t understand him! You were not in the capital! You don’t know what kind of man he is! He is a madman—a madman! He will really kill us!"

"Say it louder! Tell these people—who slaughtered the people of Chuzhou City?" Xu Qi’an drew his blade and pressed it against Duke Cao’s neck.

The icy blade seemed to freeze his blood. Duke Cao’s face went ashen, his lips trembled, and in utter despair, he screamed, "It was the Zhenbei King! It was Duke Protector Que Yongxiu! They were the ones who massacred the city!"

"Not enough!" Xu Qi’an said coldly.

"And His Majesty! His Majesty knew everything! He knew the Zhenbei King was going to massacre the city… Don’t kill me, please, I beg you!" Duke Cao sobbed uncontrollably.

A deafening uproar erupted.

What had they just heard?

The massacre of 380,000 people in Chuzhou City… was the doing of the Zhenbei King and Que Yongxiu. And their Emperor—had condoned it all?

"No wonder Administrator Zheng was killed! They murdered him!" someone cried out, eyes red with fury.

"His Majesty… he condoned the Zhenbei King’s slaughter of the city…?"

Countless faces, wide-eyed in shock, and countless pairs of eyes, flickering with hatred and confusion.

None of them had expected that coming to watch an execution would lead to such revelations.

A Great Feng prince slaughtering a city, and the Emperor turning a blind eye.

If that was possible… then one day, would the blade be turned against them as well?

At that moment, many figures leapt onto the rooftops around the Vegetable Market. Some wore the armour of the Imperial Guard, while others were clad in common attire, yet all exuded formidable auras.

"By order of His Majesty—execute Xu Qi’an!"

More than ten figures soared through the air, their combined momentum crashing down like a tidal wave upon Xu Qi’an.

Behind the crowd, the sound of galloping hooves thundered. The Imperial Guards spurred their horses forward, wielding whips to drive back the masses.

Duke Protector Que Yongxiu was elated. He cried out, "Quickly, save me! Kill this villain!"

Duke Cao’s despair turned to gleaming hope, which quickly morphed into seething hatred—he wished he could tear Xu Qi’an into pieces.

Just then, a streak of azure light descended from the sky.

With a crisp _ding_, it embedded itself into the execution platform.

In the blink of an eye, the incoming experts were struck as if by lightning, sent flying mid-air, spewing blood.

"You’ve finally come," Xu Qi’an sighed in relief.

It was a carving knife, ancient and unadorned, black in colour.

Before the invention of paper, a Confucian sage had used it to carve out the classics that would be passed down through the ages.

Before he left the palace, Xu Qi’an had already summoned it. Yesterday, he had obtained Dean Zhao Shou’s permission.

The carving shimmered with azure light, forming a protective barrier around the execution platform.

Xu Qi’an stepped on Duke Cao’s back, scanning the crowd. He drew upon his qi and declared in a thunderous voice:

"Duke Cao conspired against the loyal and virtuous, abetted tyranny, and colluded with Duke Protector Que Yongxiu to murder Chuzhou’s Administrator Zheng Xinghuai! According to the laws of Great Feng—he shall be beheaded for all to see!"

The black-gold long blade was raised and brought down heavily.

A head rolled.

Blood splattered across the execution platform, leaving a striking crimson mark in the eyes of the people.

Duke Cao was executed.

"No…!"

A desperate roar burst from Que Yongxiu’s throat. The sight of Duke Cao’s death had shaken him to the core.

Duke Cao was right—this man was a madman. A complete madman!

"Xu Qi’an! Silver Gong Xu! Sir Xu! I was wrong! I should never have been deceived by the Zhenbei King! I know my mistakes now! Please, give me another chance! Don’t kill me…!" Que Yongxiu wailed.

Before the eyes of countless common folk, he admitted his crimes. He sobbed and begged in front of them all.

"So, you do know fear," Xu Qi’an sneered.

"But that’s obvious, isn’t it! Everyone fears death. Just like the children you skewered on your spear. Just like the civilians you ordered to be shot. Just like Administrator Zheng, whom you strangled to death in his cell."

"Save me! Save me! Please, someone save me!"

An overwhelming terror exploded within Que Yongxiu’s heart as he let out a desperate plea to the experts who had been wounded by the carving’s azure glow.

He knew the executioner’s blade was hanging over his head.

But Xu Qi’an did not strike immediately. He still had to declare Que Yongxiu’s crimes. His blade would only fall upon those who deserved it.

"Que Yongxiu, Commander of Chuzhou and Duke Protector of the Nation, colluded with King Huai and the Church of the Warlock God to massacre Chuzhou City, slaughtering every last soul. His hands are drenched in blood, and his sins are unforgivable.

"After the incident, he conspired with Emperor Yuanjing to frame Chuzhou’s Administrator Zheng Xinghuai, strangling him in his prison cell. His crimes are many, and his sins are unforgivable. Today, I sentence him to death — immediately!"

_Slash!_

The blade rose and fell. A head tumbled to the ground.

As his world turned upside down, Que Yongxiu saw the vast blue sky, saw his own lifeless body, and saw Xu Qi’an standing there, smirking coldly.

"Spare…"

His lips trembled, forming the word, but before it could be spoken, endless darkness consumed him.

"Whew…"

Xu Qi’an exhaled deeply, as though expelling all the resentment in his chest.

Countless eyes watched him. The crowd was dense, yet the silence was terrifying.

In that eerie stillness, Xu Qi’an reached into his robes and retrieved his Silver Gong medallion. He slashed it in two with a single strike. _Clang!_ The severed badge fell to the ground.

Propping himself up with his blade, he threw his head back and laughed wildly. "Duke Wei… Xu Qi’an… will retire from his post!"

On a distant rooftop, a woman in red covered her mouth, tears streaming like rain.

Behind her, Princess Huaiqing, dressed in a solemn white gown for the occasion, stood frozen, staring blankly at the man laughing so freely atop the execution platform.

Beyond the crowd, a plain-looking woman had arrived late. She had failed to push through the throng.

She stood at the outskirts, listening.

Listening to the man in the distance declare the crimes of the guilty.

Listening to him say he was no longer an official.

Listening to his unrestrained laughter.

Mu Nanzhi suddenly felt—she was fortunate.

Then, from within the crowd, a man forced his way out. It was Li Han, carrying his ox-horn bow. He fell to his knees, wailing,

"Thank you, Silver Gong Xu, for eradicating the traitors! For bringing justice to the people of Chuzhou! For restoring the honour of Administrator Zheng!"

Shentu Baili, Wei Youlong, Zhao Jin, Tang Youshen, and the husband-and-wife pair, Chen Xian and his wife—these righteous men and women who had escorted Zheng Xinghuai to the capital—also stepped forward.

One after another, they knelt before the execution platform.

"Thank you, Silver Gong Xu, for eradicating the traitors! For bringing justice to the people of Chuzhou! For restoring the honour of Administrator Zheng!"

This scene burned itself into the eyes of every onlooker.

As they gazed at the young man on the platform, standing tall and unyielding, sobs arose from the crowd.

This was a man who had used his own blood, his own future, and even his own life—to trade for justice.

This moment will later be recorded in history.

*Year 37 of Yuanjing, beginning of summer. Silver Gong Xu Qi’an beheaded the Duke of Cao and Duke Protector of the Nation at the vegetable market, delivering the final verdict on the Chuzhou city massacre. Seven righteous men knelt before the platform, unmoving.*
