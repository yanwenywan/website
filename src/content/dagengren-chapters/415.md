# 415. Awakening the Sabre

“I’m heading to Quanrong Mountain later to drink, eat meat, and sleep with women. What are your plans?”

Xu Qi’an smiled at Nangong Qianrou.

Nangong Qianrou frowned slightly and sneered. “It’s just a jianghu organisation — what’s there to entertain?”

Xu Qi’an reined in his smile and said quietly, “I’m no longer a Silver Gong.”

The mockery and disdain in Nangong Qianrou’s eyes slowly faded, as though he had suddenly lost interest in the conversation.

After a long silence, he said indifferently, “I’ll see what the commotion is about.”

*Huh, that’s not like Second Brother Nangong. Could it be that he’s worried this is a Hongmen Banquet set up by the Wulin Alliance?* Xu Qi’an mused to himself.

…

Quanrong Mountain was steep and shrouded in mist.

It was a well-known blessed land in Jianzhou, with lush forests and the calls of cranes and apes. From the mountainside upward, courtyards and pavilions were scattered across the terrain, stretching all the way to the mountaintop.

“Quanrong Mountain is a famous scenic spot in Jianzhou. The main peak is majestic, the side peaks graceful, and the main peak boasts a waterfall hundreds of feet high. During the rainy season, when mountain floods erupt, even a sixth rank expert wouldn’t withstand the force of the waterfall.”

“I’ve heard the Wulin Alliance headquarters commands eight thousand cavalry — the direct descendants of that warrior who once vied for supremacy in the Central Plains.”

Passing under a towering archway at the mountain’s base, Xu Qi’an clicked his tongue in admiration. “Eight thousand cavalry could sweep Jianzhou. Why has the court tolerated the Wulin Alliance’s existence for so many years?”

Nangong Qianrou listened to his rambling with little interest, but when it came to the last topic, he couldn’t help but say:

“Because that warrior made a pact with the founding emperor.”

“What kind of pact?” Xu Qi’an asked curiously.

“How would I know? Father never said,” Nangong Qianrou replied with a roll of his eyes.

Xu Qi’an continued to chat idly. “The beauties of Jianzhou’s Wanhua Tower are all charming and alluring. Interested in taking one back as a concubine? I’m sure Pavilion Master Xiao would be happy to oblige.”

Nangong Qianrou simply ignored him.

“If it were me, I’d bring Pavilion Master Xiao back to the capital and make her a concubine — that would be perfect.”

“You haven’t married, have you? If you were still a Silver Gong of the Nightwatcher’s Office, it’d be inappropriate to marry a jianghu woman. But now, she could easily be your principal wife,” Nangong Qianrou remarked.

“No, no, no,” Xu Qi’an waved his hands repeatedly.

“Why not?” Nangong Qianrou frowned.

“The position of principal wife — I’m saving that for Princess Lin’an or Princess Huaiqing,” Xu Qi’an said solemnly.

“Fuck off!”

Nangong Qianrou snapped.

*Believe what you want…*

Soon, the two arrived at the main courtyard of Quanrong Mountain’s main peak. After being announced by the Alliance’s steward, they were ushered into the reception hall, where the purple-robed Alliance Leader Cao Qingyang sat, his features dignified and imposing.

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Cao Qingyang said, “Gold Gong Nangong, please wait here. I have something to discuss privately with Silver Gong Xu.”

He rose from his seat and walked out of the reception hall in silence.

Xu Qi’an followed him through the residential area toward the back of the mountain, gradually leaving the buildings behind.

“The Great Ancestor wants to see you.”

Cao Qingyang led him into the dense forest, walking along a narrow path. “Don’t worry. The Great Ancestor isn’t a bloodthirsty madman. He’s simply interested in your deeds.”

Xu Qi’an quickly reflected on himself — the jade pendant from the Jianzheng was on him, and Shenshu was asleep. Right now, he was just the ordinary Freeloader Xu. Meeting a big shot shouldn’t be a problem.

Most importantly, the other party was a martial artist. Even if there was a minor issue, he probably wouldn’t notice.

In fact, attending this banquet at Quanrong Mountain was partly a gamble — he had hoped he might get to meet the Great Ancestor of the Wulin Alliance.

*Heh, I really am blessed with great fortune…* He mockingly thought to himself.

After walking through the forest path for about a stick of incense’s time, Cao Qingyang led him to a massive cliff face. Just as they stepped out of the forest, Xu Qi’an’s hair stood on end, and his scalp tingled.

Instinctively, he turned toward the source of the danger.

Above the cliff, a giant beast lowered its head. Two crimson eyes the size of water vats stared at them gloomily.

The creature was pitch-black, covered in coarse, bristling fur. It resembled a dog but had a face akin to a human’s.

*The strange beast Quanrong… Quanrong Mountain is named after it… A powerful otherworldly creature — I can’t beat it…* Xu Qi’an’s mind raced.

At that moment, the Quanrong withdrew its head and vanished into the cliff.

“The Quanrong is the Wulin Alliance’s guardian beast. It once followed the Great Ancestor in his conquests, much like the Spirit Dragon and the Human Emperor,” Cao Qingyang smiled.

“You’ve probably heard of the Spirit Dragon — there’s one in the capital that breathes purple qi. It’s a mythical creature of the highest level, but it only bonds with the imperial family.”

*No need to explain so much, it’s just a lowly lapdog…* Xu Qi’an lampooned.

Following Cao Qingyang, he stopped before the stone gate at the base of the cliff. Cao Qingyang respectfully said, “Great Ancestor, Silver Gong Xu is here.”

A hoarse voice from within the gate said, “Strong foundation, restrained inner radiance — not bad.”

Xu Qi’an cupped his fists and respectfully said, “Greetings, Senior.”

The aged voice spoke again from behind the gate:

“I’ve heard about you. A smart man should leave the capital sooner rather than later. Are you interested in joining my Wulin Alliance? I could take you as my disciple. Heh, you’ve already proven your character through your actions.

“With a few more years of experience, you’d be more than qualified to become the next Alliance Leader.”

*Why does everyone want to be my father…* Xu Qi’an calmly declined. “There are still unresolved matters in the capital. Besides, I already have a master.”

“Wei Yuan, I suppose,” the Great Ancestor said matter-of-factly from behind the stone gate.

Xu Qi’an remained silent.

“Is there anything you’d like to ask me?” The Great Ancestor didn’t press the matter, speaking with surprising ease.

*Senior, you’re really considerate.* Xu Qi’an happened to have some questions, so he immediately asked:

“I’ve read some records about you. You were once powerful enough to rival the founding emperor. Six hundred years have passed — why has the founding emperor long since passed away, yet you are still alive?”

Silence greeted his question.

Just when Xu Qi’an thought he wouldn’t get an answer, the Great Ancestor sighed behind the gate.

“With your current rank, this matter is beyond your level. You’re not supposed to know.”

After a brief pause, the Great Ancestor continued:

“There are many experts within the Great Feng imperial family — the founding emperor, the Wuzong Emperor, and the Zhenbei King, to name a few.

“But none of them have lived until now. Do you know why?”

“Please enlighten me, Senior.”

“Those entwined with fortune cannot attain longevity.”

This answer struck Xu Qi’an like a heavy hammer, leaving his head buzzing.

“Why?” he murmured.

“That, I do not know. Perhaps it is a law of heaven and earth. You could ask the Confucians or the Jianzheng of the Sitianjian,” the Great Ancestor said with a chuckle.

*The Confucians know this secret…* Xu Qi’an’s pupils shrank in shock. “So… the Confucian Sage is truly dead?”

He had always suspected that the Confucian Sage might have faked his death. After all, how could a being who transcended the ranks have died at eighty-two? That would be an insult to one’s dignity.

“The Confucian Sage was no exception,” the Great Ancestor replied.

*If the Great Ancestor was telling the truth, then the Confucian Sage was truly dead. The fact that no immortal figures existed in the Great Feng imperial family supported the Great Ancestor’s claim.*

*The Confucian Sage… is really dead…*

Xu Qi’an couldn’t hide the regret in his heart. At the same time, some doubts within him were resolved. *No wonder Emperor Yuanjing was so “lenient” towards the Zhenbei King. If there was anyone most blessed with fortune, it would naturally be the emperor. Meanwhile, the Zhenbei King was purely a martial man. He must have…*

“No!”

Xu Qi’an blurted out.

Cao Qingyang turned his head, puzzled, and glanced at him.

“You seem to have thought of something?” the old man said.

Xu Qi’an ignored the words of a peak martial artist. He lowered his gaze, his face blank, but the information flooding his mind was like boiling water.

First: Those blessed with fortune cannot achieve immortality. This alone isn’t enough to justify Emperor Yuanjing’s trust in the Zhenbei King, because the Zhenbei King is a royal king of the Great Feng and is also incapable of achieving immortality.

History had already proven this.

Therefore, there must be another hidden reason behind Emperor Yuanjing’s trust in the Zhenbei King.

Second: As the sovereign of a nation, Emperor Yuanjing couldn’t possibly be unaware of this secret. Yet even knowing that those blessed with fortune cannot achieve longevity, he had still pursued cultivation for the past twenty years, yearning for immortality. This presented a contradiction.

Did he believe he was more exceptional than the founding emperor and Emperor Wuzong? Did he think he could surpass the Confucian Sage, who himself couldn’t resist the laws of heaven and earth?

Emperor Yuanjing might be unscrupulous, but he was not a fool. On the contrary, he was highly intelligent.

Amidst his swirling thoughts, Xu Qi’an asked in a low voice, “What does Senior think about Emperor Yuanjing’s pursuit of Daoist cultivation?”

The old man pondered for a moment and said, “Perhaps he believes he has found a way to achieve both immortality and the throne. Heh, the one helping him is probably the Daoist Leader of the Human Sect.”

*It couldn’t be Luo Yuheng…* Xu Qi’an frowned.

It wasn’t that he was favouring his aunt, but rather because he recalled certain details. Emperor Yuanjing initially explored cultivation on his own. A few years later, he appointed Luo Yuheng as the National Teacher and established the Human Sect as the state religion.

As a native of the capital, Xu Qi’an still remembered this clearly.

*If it wasn’t Luo Yuheng, then who could it be? Hmm… It wasn’t impossible that Luo Yuheng had secretly led Emperor Yuanjing into cultivating the Dao. He would have to ask Duke Wei when he returned to the capital…*

“I heard that you once had an agreement with the founding emperor?” Xu Qi’an seized the opportunity to extract information.

“Heh, just a verbal agreement. After the fall of the Great Zhou, various rebel armies fought over the Central Plains. Back then, I had already lost interest in vying for the throne. Because I had found a path to advance to Rank Two, I desired immortality more than the throne.

“It’s simply my nature. I was born into poverty and roamed the jianghu in my youth, settling scores with a clear conscience. That left me with too much of a martial temperament, and I longed for a free and unrestrained life.

“The reason I rebelled was because the people back then lived lives worse than animals. When life becomes hopeless, rebellion is inevitable.

“He was different from me. He was ambitious and harboured grand ambitions of unifying the Central Plains. He wasn’t interested in immortality.

“I remember he used to say that the true meaning of life lay in achieving great accomplishments, not in pursuing immortality. Immortality was boring—being emperor was interesting.

“I lost that battle. It wasn’t intentional—I lost fair and square. At that time, we made a verbal agreement that if his incompetent descendants ever repeated the mistakes of Great Zhou, I would be the first to raise the banner of rebellion and overthrow the corrupt dynasty.”

*Every pioneer bears sincere intentions, but the descendants who follow often descend into decadence and decline…* Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly.

“Has senior today advanced to Rank Two?” Xu Qi’an tested the waters.

After asking, he quickly added, “Forgive my impertinence.”

“Without slaughtering beings like the Zhenbei King did, it’s extremely difficult to reach Rank Two on one’s own. I’ve been in seclusion for five hundred years, yet I still haven’t taken that final step.”

The old man said indifferently, “Qingyang wanted to steal the Earth Sect’s lotus root to help me break through.”

Xu Qi’an immediately looked at Cao Qingyang, thinking: *That’s not what you told the major sects. You said you wanted the lotus root for the Wulin Alliance, so everyone could share the lotus seeds every sixty years.*

Cao Qingyang met his gaze and said, “I can cultivate a section of the lotus root.”

“It won’t survive,” Xu Qi’an reminded him.

“That’s not my problem,” Cao Qingyang replied calmly.

“…”

Xu Qi’an ignored him and turned to the stone gate. “Can the lotus root help you advance to Rank Two?”

The old man replied, “The chances are high.”

Even so, he hadn’t personally acted—he had only given Cao Qingyang a drop of his blood essence. This ancestor of the Wulin Alliance was in an odd state…

Xu Qi’an’s eyes flickered.

“I hope that one day, I can lend you a hand,” he said.

After bidding farewell to the ancestor of the Wulin Alliance, he followed Cao Qingyang back to the main peak.

At dusk, a grand banquet was held at Quanrong Mountain. The sect leaders and masters of the major sects all attended.

Naturally, Xu Qi’an became the focus of the banquet. He was perfectly at ease in such situations.

In his past life, he had often accompanied his superiors to drinking parties. When he ventured into business, he also spent plenty of time drinking with clients. After arriving in this world, he had become a regular at the Jiaofangsi.

His skills at navigating drinking banquets were on par with a first rank!

In no time, he had bonded with the sect leaders and masters of the Wulin Alliance, casually addressing the tower master of Wanhua Tower, Xiao Yuenu, as “Sister” this and “Sister” that.

Yang Cuixue and the others were also surprised and pleased. They hadn’t expected Silver Gong Xu to be so smooth and adept at drinking games, downing his cups without hesitation while casually discussing the court’s secrets.

For instance, he mentioned that the Empress, whose beauty could topple nations, was rather fond of Silver Gong Xu and had considered making him a prince consort.

He also mentioned that he was a regular guest at the princesses’ residences and could accurately describe the layouts of their estates and even share some private details about the princesses.

He also revealed that the Jianzheng of the Sitianjian had his own troubles. The Jianzheng’s five disciples were all talented and eloquent, which gave him no end of headaches.

Furthermore, the daughter of Prime Minister Wang was deeply in love with Xu Qi’an’s cousin. She was so infatuated that she was even willing to turn against her father for him.

Of course, the most frequent topic was the gossip from the Jiaofangsi.

For example, Fuxiang, the oiran, was skilled at playing the qin but even more talented at the xiao. Mingyan was unparalleled in dance and incredibly flexible. Xiaoya was well-read yet warm-hearted…

It was only when he was slightly tipsy that the banquet finally came to an end.

Xu Qi’an carried his sabre, his steps unsteady, as he returned to the courtyard where he was staying.

As soon as he entered his room, the drunken haze in his eyes vanished.

*Once I’ve dealt with the matters in the capital and investigated Emperor Yuanjing, I’ll come to Jianzhou and establish my connections. That way, I’ll have a foothold in Jianzhou in the future…*

He lit an oil lamp, sat at the table, and laid his black-gold sabre across it.

Next, he took out a small jade mirror, poured out a lotus seed, peeled it open, and gently embedded it into the sabre’s edge.

He didn’t have a jade box. Even if he did, it wouldn’t fit a sabre four feet long.

Zhong Li had told him that this sabre was only missing a weapon spirit. The lotus seed could awaken a spirit and elevate the sabre to the rank of a peerless divine weapon.
