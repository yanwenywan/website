# 342. Court Appointment

Song Qing hurriedly dashed out of the secret chamber with lightning speed. Moments later, he returned, holding a thick blue book, which he respectfully handed to Xu Qi'an.

Nowadays, the arcanists of the Sitianjian had adopted blue books as their personal journals. They hoped this would become a tradition, believing that in a few generations, blue books would become synonymous with alchemy.

When outsiders mentioned the arcanists' alchemical techniques, they would inevitably think of the blue book.

The founding author of the first generation of blue books, Xu Qi'an, accepted Song Qing’s alchemy journal, opened it, and scanned a few lines.

_Too long, didn’t read… and couldn’t understand anyway…_ He pretended to read intently for a long while, occasionally nodding or shaking his head.

The members of the Heaven and Earth Society and Song Qing all had their eyes glued to him. When Xu Qi'an finally closed the book, Song Qing eagerly asked:

“Master Xu, is there anything amiss?”

Li Miaozhen and the others adopted attentive postures, focusing their gaze on him.

“There are still quite a few issues, Brother Song. This path is long and arduous. You must seek wisdom high and low without slacking.” Xu Qi'an sighed, earnestly advising.

“And so, where exactly is the problem…”

Before Song Qing could finish, Xu Qi'an interrupted him, saying, “Brother Song, you must understand that alchemy has its limits. Regarding your creation, I have a suggestion for you to consider.”

Song Qing’s eyes lit up instantly, his attention successfully diverted. He eagerly asked, “Master Xu, I knew you would have a solution. If only you had been there when I was nurturing it, it would surely have turned out better.”

_No, I would have just stood by one side and shouted, “666!”_ Xu Qi'an cleared his throat, glanced at the crowd, and fixed his gaze on Song Qing, saying:

“To my knowledge, there is a heavenly treasure called the Nine-Coloured Lotus. It can awaken all things, even granting a stone sentience. Your creation would require its enlightenment.”

“Nine-Coloured Lotus… Nine-Coloured Lotus…” Song Qing murmured, “Such a miraculous object exists in the world?”

The Heaven and Earth Society members suddenly had an epiphany, believing Xu Qi'an's suggestion to be plausible.

_Indeed, if the Nine-Coloured Lotus can enlighten all things, it should be able to awaken this body. Once it gains sentience, Susu could successfully possess it…_ Li Miaozhen’s face lit up with joy, her path forward now clear.

Susu, on the other hand, yearned for the Nine-Coloured Lotus to ripen immediately so she could claim her new body.

_No, no, I want a female body! I want to be a woman... but if it’s a male body, at least I won’t have to bear Xu Ningyan’s children… what if he still wants me as his concubine…_

The image of herself in a male body being pinned under Xu Qi'an and subjected to his whims flashed in Susu’s mind, making her shudder violently.

“The Nine-Coloured Lotus is a treasure of the Earth Sect. In essence, it can be considered an alchemical material, as all things are alchemy,” Xu Qi'an remarked with a smile.

“All things are alchemy…” Song Qing was full of admiration and sighed, “Master Xu, you truly are a genius in alchemy. There was a time I felt anger—anger that your second uncle never sent you to the Sitianjian to study under its tutelage.”

_Please no, leave my second uncle out of this; he’s suffered enough!_

For Susu, this trip to the Sitianjian was nothing short of a new chapter. For the others, their feelings were more complex: they were simultaneously awed by Song Qing’s achievements in alchemy and unsettled by his experiments in life alchemy.

Before leaving, Xu Qi'an pulled Song Qing aside to a quiet corner and whispered, “Brother Song, I have a request.”

“Speak.”

Song Qing was eager to oblige Xu Qi'an’s request.

“I need you to craft a female body for a certain spirit to inhabit. When the time comes, I’ll find a way to acquire the Nine-Coloured Lotus,” Xu Qi'an said.

“Of course, I’ll take care of it,” Song Qing agreed readily, visibly excited at the mention of the Nine-Coloured Lotus.

“But I have conditions,” Xu Qi'an continued, lowering his voice even further. “First, the female body must be beautiful. Exceptionally beautiful. And then…”

He gestured vaguely at his chest and whispered conspiratorially, “It must be… ample.”

Song Qing, indifferent to women, frowned and asked, “What is your definition of ‘ample’?”

He needed a reference point.

Xu Qi'an thought for a moment and solemnly replied, “Caiwei cubed.”

…

To Xu Qi'an, this trip to the Sitianjian was worthwhile—a promise fulfilled.

He was a man who valued his word, in both his past life and the present.

As they left the Sitianjian, Chu Yuanzhen and Hengyuan bid their farewells. Xu Qi'an, accompanied by Li Miaozhen, Susu, and Lina, headed towards the Xu residence.

The bubbly Chu Caiwei, who had followed them all the way, decided to stay for dinner at Xu manor.

After dinner, she made up her mind to stay the night, sharing a bed with Lina. The mood was brimming with camaraderie.

After the meal, Xu Qi'an went to Erlang’s study, where he found his younger brother reading by lamplight. Smiling, he teased:

“How was your time with Miss Wang today?”

Xu Erlang’s expression turned peculiar as he replied gravely, “Big brother, I believe Miss Wang desires over my looks.”

*The wording is off, but the meaning is clear…* Xu Qi'an was a little surprised—Erlang had finally caught on?

Xu Erlang wasn’t stupid. His emotional intelligence was just as high; he merely lacked experience with women. He had failed to notice the signs during their first few encounters because he was too engrossed in his (imaginary) intellectual sparring with Prime Minister Wang.

“She often compliments my appearance and behaves in a manner suggesting she wishes to be closer to me,” Xu Xinnian said, his brows furrowed.

“And what do you think?” Xu Qi'an asked.

“Prime Minister Wang is an enemy of Duke Wei, and you are Duke Wei’s confidant. How can I entangle myself with Miss Wang?” Xu Xinnian declared, making his stance clear.

_I’ve always been cautious about letting Erlang be labelled a “eunuch clique” member. I’m worried he’ll lack a patron in court. But if he could align with Prime Minister Wang…_ Xu Qi'an deliberated carefully before replying:

“You must decide for yourself. The road ahead must be walked with your own two feet. In court politics, there are no eternal enemies. Didn’t Duke Wei and Prime Minister Wang just join forces to root out bureaucratic corruption?”

He continued, “Moreover, even if you and Miss Wang end up together, it’s she who will marry into the Xu family—not you marrying into the Wang family. That makes all the difference. You’ll remain free.”

Xu Xinnian looked embarrassed, his face flushing red. “Big brother, you make it sound as though Miss Wang and I already have some improper relationship.”

He then frowned slightly and added, “Besides, she only likes me for my looks. If I were ugly, would she still like me?”

Xu Qi'an replied, “That depends on how you interpret ‘looks.’”

He didn’t think there was anything wrong with Miss Wang admiring Xu Xinnian’s appearance. After all, isn’t falling for someone’s face the most natural starting point for affection?

He liked Lin’an, Huaiqing, Caiwei, Li Miaozhen, Susu, Lina, and even the National Teacher because they were all beautiful.

Even a mare as exquisite as his little mare stirred his affection—he missed riding her dearly if he went a day without it.

As for Zhong Li, who always kept her face hidden under disheveled hair, Xu Qi'an reserved the right to withhold judgment.

…

Returning to his room, he practiced slow punches as described in _The Theory of Meridian Flow_, sensing the flow of qi in his body, the circulation of his blood, and the contraction and relaxation of his muscles during each movement.

After half an hour, Xu Qi’an sat at the table and accepted the warm tea Zhong Li handed him. Muttering to himself, he said:

“Too slow. _The Theory of Meridian Flow_ is, at best, an auxiliary method. Whether I can achieve Transforming Force depends entirely on myself... At this rate, by year’s end, I’ll be hard-pressed to reach the fourth rank, let alone the fifth.

“I must find a way to improve my strength. As my fortune awakens, the mastermind won’t sit idly by. Even with the Jianzheng and Shenshu's protection, I’m far from absolutely safe. The enemy is at least a third-rank Arcanist, possibly backed by an even more formidable force.

"Impatience leads to failure. While Transforming Force is challenging, at least I’m making slow progress. What’s harder for me is advancing my official rank and gaining more influence."

Previously, he stayed in the capital because of its prosperity and resources, with a mindset of "If worse comes to worst, I’ll wander the world." But now, he sought greater power within the court—his strength and authority complementing each other—so he could one day face his "creditors" on equal footing.

What he lacked now was opportunity—an opportunity to earn merit.

"Unfortunately, the capital is calm now that the official evaluation year has passed. Opportunities for merit are few and far between," Xu Qi’an sighed, redirecting his thoughts to improving his cultivation.

Just then, inspiration struck him:

"One Blade from Heaven and Earth focuses all qi into a single strike. _Transforming Force_ involves channelling all energy into one, minimising waste and maximising impact. The two are remarkably similar."

The idea thrilled him, and he was eager to test it.

Xu Qi’an stood in the room, calming his emotions and reining in his qi. He began to focus...

"No, no, I’m not actually performing One Blade from Heaven and Earth right now."

He stopped, dissipating his qi. This time, he executed the One Blade from Heaven and Earth technique using purely physical strength without involving qi.

_Crack!_

His fist struck out, producing a crisp sound as the air burst.

Without qi, the punch caused no large-scale destruction.

*My arm still trembles slightly, but at the moment of impact, my energy does converge toward a single point. Though there’s still significant leakage...*

This realisation filled Xu Qi’an with exhilaration. He had found the right path. By training this way, his advancement to the fifth rank could be greatly accelerated.

*It’s far superior to The Theory of Meridian Flow. Ha! I’m such a genius, finding another way...* His grin froze as a new thought struck him.

One Blade from Heaven and Earth was a technique gifted to the Nightwatchers by the Sitianjian—a subtle offering from the Jianzheng.

_Did you anticipate all this, Jianjojo?_

…

The Imperial Study.

Shortly after dawn, the eunuchs sent by the Emperor summoned the court officials to the Hall.

When all had gathered, Emperor Yuanjing, clad in his daoist robes and exuding a calm demeanour, walked lightly to his throne behind the grand desk and sat down.

"You’ve repeatedly petitioned to investigate the ‘Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles.’ We share your concerns," the Emperor said, his tone measured as he looked down at the gathered officials.

"We intend to form a delegation to the border to investigate this matter thoroughly. Do you have suitable candidates?"

Prime Minister Wang stepped forward and bowed. "Your Majesty, given the gravity of this case, it would be best handled collaboratively by the Three Judicial Offices and the Nightwatchers."

This arrangement, established over years, ensured that major cases were jointly managed by these offices, enabling both collaboration and mutual oversight.

Seeing no objections or additions, the Emperor nodded. "And the chief investigator? Do you have any recommendations?"

In such joint investigations, leadership was crucial to avoid inefficiency.

Upon hearing "chief investigator," the officials instinctively pictured a brash young man in a Silver Gong uniform—a testament both to Xu Qi’an's reputation and his numerous accomplishments over the past half-year.

After a moment of contemplation, Prime Minister Wang proposed, "We could appoint Silver Gong Xu Qi’an as the chief investigator."

He didn’t elaborate on Xu Qi’an's qualifications; there was no need.

The Emperor nodded again, his gaze sweeping across the officials. "What say you, my ministers?"

"Excellent!" the officials echoed in unison.

…

The Tea Room, the Tower of Noble Spirit.

"What?! Me, the chief investigator for the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles case?" Xu Qi’an exclaimed, his eyes wide with surprise.

This was entirely different from the Yunzhou case, where Inspector General Zhang had been the lead investigator, and he was merely part of the team. Here, he was the official leader in name and practice.

The implications were clear: if the case succeeded, he would claim the most credit. If the massacre were real and he uncovered the truth, the rewards would be monumental. But failure would bring penalties.

And worse, if the case implicated the Zhenbei King—if the massacre were due to his false reports—Xu Qi’an would face immense danger.

"Duke Wei, the officials nominated me for this position with ulterior motives, right? Why would His Majesty choose a mere Silver Gong over an Inspector General for such a role?"

Xu Qi’an turned to the man in azure robes across the table, his tone pleading. "You’ve got to send a Gold Gong to protect me, Duke Wei."

Wei Yuan gently stroked his teacup, speaking warmly. "Good. You’ve grown sharper. In the past, you wouldn’t have considered the intentions of court officials or the Emperor."

_No, I just relied on you, the master of political intrigue, to do the thinking…_ Xu Qi’an replied humbly, "Please guide me, Duke Wei."
