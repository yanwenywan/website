# 231. A Gift From the Jianzheng

It seemed urgent. They were Xu Qi’an’s colleagues — did something happen to him?

Old Zhang, the doorman, bowed and nodded, "Please, follow me, sirs."

Nangong Qianrou stood up and, under Old Zhang's guidance, walked through the front hall and into the backyard. From a distance, they saw a young child, dressed in simple clothes, being led by a stunning young woman in a long dress.

The child pouted, looking unwilling, as she walked alongside the woman.

The two groups met, and the young woman stopped, staring in surprise at the three Nightwatchers.

"These gentlemen are here to see the master," Old Zhang explained.

Xu Lingyue nodded politely and averted her gaze, pulling the child aside.

Xu Lingyin, holding her sister's hand with one hand, raised the other, pointed at Nangong Qianrou, and shouted:

"A beautiful big sister, just as pretty as mummy."

*Beautiful big sister?!* Nangong Qianrou, who usually had an expressionless face, almost lost his composure. He looked incredulously at Xu Lingyin, his eye twitching.

*Is this child an idiot? Are her eyes just for decoration?*

He slightly raised his head, trying to make the child see his Adam's apple. But the foolish child didn't understand, repeatedly saying:

"Sister, you're as pretty as my mum."

She seemed to think that being as beautiful as her mother was the highest compliment.

Nangong Qianrou left with a flick of his sleeve. If it were anyone else calling him a woman, they'd be in big trouble. But as a dignified Gold Gong, he didn't stoop to argue with a child.

Xu Lingyue watched Nangong Qianrou and his companions enter the main hall.

"Sister, why did we stop?" Xu Lingyin looked up, her small face full of curiosity.

"They're our big brother's colleagues; we'll go to school later." Xu Lingyue replied softly, leading her sister back.

In the back hall, Xu Pingzhi, who had just finished eating, hurriedly stood up to greet them. He was a bit puzzled and fearful, cupping his hands in salute, "Gold Gong."

A Gold Gong visiting the Xu family was something Xu Pingzhi had never expected.

With the noble status of a Gold Gong, even though Xu Qi'an was thriving in the Nightwatcher's office, it was unlikely for someone of such high rank to visit a Bronze Gong's home.

Unless it was something urgent.

*This Gold Gong was quite handsome, almost mistakable for a woman from afar, comparable to Erlang's effeminate looks...* Xu Pingzhi thought.

"Pretty sister."

The little child, following Xu Lingyue back, stood at the threshold, calling out flatteringly.

*Annoying brat, you wont be so bubbly soon…* Nangong Qianrou frowned, his heart suddenly becoming heavy at the thought of Xu Qi’an’s death.

His gaze swept past Xu Pingzhi and landed on the beautiful woman at the dining table. The child's words weren't wrong; she was indeed a beautiful woman.

"To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Gold Gong?" Xu Pingzhi asked.

Nangong Qianrou withdrew his gaze, paused for a moment, and said solemnly, "Bronze Gong Xu Qi'an fell in the line of duty in Yunzhou. I am here to deliver his condolence payment."

As he spoke, he opened his hand, and the Bronze Gong behind him silently handed over the silver.

Nangong Qianrou then handed the three hundred taels of silver to Xu Pingzhi, who did not take it. He stood frozen, like a statue, unmoving.

Even his eyes seemed fixed in place.

Xu Qi'an fell in the line of duty... Nangong Qianrou's words struck Xu Pingzhi like a thunderclap, shattering his soul and breaking his heart.

In an instant, it felt like the world lost its color, his mind filled with the tragic news, leaving him utterly despondent.

Xu Qi'an was his nephew, his elder brother's orphan, whom he had raised for twenty years. They were like father and son, or perhaps even closer.

Uncle Xu had always felt a strong sense of responsibility towards Xu Qi'an because he was the last of his brother's line, the only continuation.

Raising him, seeing him marry and have children, and continuing the family line was Xu Pingzhi's greatest wish.

Now, his nephew was gone, just like that?

In a daze, Xu Pingzhi suddenly heard a sound of someone collapsing. He turned around to see his wife fainting.

"Sister, what does 'fell in the line of duty' mean?"

Xu Lingyin didn't understand. She looked up at Xu Lingyue.

Xu Lingyue didn't answer, standing there motionless, like a lifeless paper flower, beautiful yet pale.

Old Zhang, the doorman, began to cry, "It means he's dead!"

Nangong Qianrou sighed inwardly, placed the silver on the table, and said, "In three to five days, the body will be returned to the capital. You should prepare for the funeral."

The urgent message had naturally arrived in the capital before the body.

After saying this, Nangong Qianrou turned to leave.

"You're lying!"

A roar like a little lion's came from behind. Xu Lingyin blocked the path of the three Nightwatchers, glaring fiercely at Nangong Qianrou.

A six-year-old child already understood what death meant.

Nangong Qianrou ignored her, sidestepping Xu Lingyin and continuing to walk away. But Xu Lingyin wouldn't let him go, chasing and hitting him, shouting, "You're lying, you're lying..."

A child's mind was simple: as long as you make the liar take back his words, big brother will come back. As long as you beat the liar, big brother will come back...

Nangong Qianrou had to quicken his pace, leaving the Xu residence with the two Bronze Gongs. Even from a distance, he looked back uneasily.

The child had followed them, standing alone at the gate, crying loudly, her small body trembling.

Like a little beast abandoned by the world.

Nangong Qianrou suddenly felt regret. He should have waited a bit, informing them of Xu Qi'an's death after the child had gone to school.

"Take her back and have her family take good care of her," Nangong Qianrou ordered the Bronze Gong on his left.

"Yes, sir."

At the Xu residence, Xu Pingzhi, after carrying his fainted wife to the bedroom, returned to the front hall to find his daughter. He intended to comfort her, but Xu Lingyue sat silently at the table, her eyes hollow, not moving an inch.

Uncle Xu sighed deeply, called over Old Zhang, and said in a deep voice, "Send someone to the academy to inform Erlang and have him return home as soon as possible."

Old Zhang wiped his tears and nodded, retreating.

In fact, few servants in the household knew how to ride a horse. Considering the importance and urgency, it would have been more appropriate for Xu Pingzhi to go to the Cloud Deer Academy himself.

But Old Zhang knew that the master couldn’t ride a horse any more.

…


From the capital to Qingyun Mountain and back takes four hours on horseback, and if one’s horse was not a good breed, then it may even take longer.

Xu Xinnian returned home at noon, alone, leaving the messenger behind. Galloping to the gate, Xu Xinnian abruptly pulled on the reins, causing the horse to halt and rear up. Before the horse's front hooves could land, he dismounted and rushed into the house, his face pale. He stumbled over the threshold, fell hard, and cut his forehead. Unaware, he staggered up and stumbled into the house, seeing his family in the back hall—his tearful mother and his sister with vacant, lifeless eyes. He also noticed Xu Lingyin sitting alone on the steps outside the front hall, scribbling aimlessly on the ground with a dry stick.

The adults were immersed in their grief, neglecting the child's feelings. Xu Lingyin didn't dare to ask or speak, sitting silently and alone on the steps.

Xu Pingzhi, with red-rimmed eyes, looked at him and said in a low voice, "Erlang, your brother... he's gone."

Xu Xinnian's body swayed, and he nearly blacked out.

...

Just after noon, the sky darkened, and a biting wind swept through. Soon, it began to snow heavily, the first snowfall since the Spring Festival. In no time, snow blanketed the rooftops, treetops, and paths, draping the world in a thin layer of silver.

In the Imperial Palace, in the Imperial Garden, the Crown Prince invited the Second, Fourth, and Sixth Princes and the three princesses to watch the snow in Qingji Pavilion.

A fire burned brightly, and the table was laden with fine wine and food. The Crown Prince took a sip of wine and said with a smile, "It snowed only once last year. I thought we'd have to wait until the end of the year to see snow again. I didn't expect it to come so soon after the Spring Festival."

The Third Princess laughed, "I've heard that the larger the snowfall before spring, the better the harvest in the autumn. I don't know if it's true, but this snow did come before spring, even if it was after the spring festival."

The Crown Prince nodded with a smile, then looked at the Fourth Prince and asked, "What's wrong with Huaiqing lately? She stays in her quarters all day and claims she's unwell whenever we invite her out for a drink."

The Fourth Prince grunted and shook his head, "I don't know."

Huaiqing hadn't been seen for a while. She used to occasionally meet with her royal siblings, but recently she had shut herself away completely. Although they were siblings, Huaiqing's aloof personality made it hard for them to be close.

*Hmph, she must be too ashamed to show her face under my brilliance...* Lin'an thought proudly, taking another sip of wine. The widespread popularity of Five in a Row had made her famous in the capital. How could an insignificant Huaiqing dare to step out under her illustrious reputation? With this thought, Lin'an happily took a few more sips, her rosy cheeks and slightly hazy eyes adding to her charm.

The princes couldn't help but steal a few more glances. Having such a beautiful sister was indeed a delightful thing. Although her intelligence could be debated, her extraordinary beauty was undeniable.

To Xu Qi'an, Lin'an fit the image of a young, beautiful girl in a club who wasn't very bright, reminiscent of a stunning girl in school who was often pursued by boys but wasn't academically strong. She was the kind of girl who would frown and scratch her head over math problems, yet her beauty attracted the admiration of boys and the envy of girls, who secretly called her a "vixen."

Huaiqing, on the other hand, was the cold and intelligent type, full marks with a flick of a pen, though her aloofness made her unpopular among the girls, who would privately grumble, "What's so great about her?"

The only difference between a cold, intelligent girl and a vixen was that the former could dominate the other girls in class, while the latter could only pout in frustration.

"This snow is a good omen. Do you know about the urgent message from yesterday?" The Crown Prince changed the topic.

"Is it about Zhang Xingying suppressing the rebellion in Yunzhou?" the Fourth Prince asked.

The Crown Prince nodded, "The Minister of Industry from the Qi Clique colluded with the Church of the Warlock God to build power in Yunzhou. Their intentions were treacherous. Fortunately, Inspector Zhang is capable and uncovered the plot, eliminating the rebels."

He paused and then looked at his sister, Lin'an, "Xu Qi'an played a crucial role in this case and has been posthumously honored as the Viscount of Changle. It's well-deserved."

"Of course, Xu Qi'an is my...." Lin'an had been pleased to hear her brother praise Xu Qi'an and instinctively wanted to boast. But as she listened, she suddenly froze.

"Brother Crown Prince... what, what did you say?"

Her charming face and sweet smile froze, her peach blossom eyes widening but looking vacant as she stared blankly at the Crown Prince.

"Oh, you didn't know?" The Fourth Prince sighed, "That Bronze Gong, Xu Qi'an, died in the line of duty. It's a pity."

Crash... the wine cup shattered on the ground.

Everyone looked at Lin'an.

Lin'an seemed unaware of her loss of composure. Her delicate, pale hand clutched the Crown Prince's sleeve, trembling and sobbing, "Brother Crown Prince, please don't joke with me..."

Her eyes were filled with tears and a pitiful plea.

The Crown Prince was taken aback, his expression darkening. He brushed off Lin'an's hand and said sternly, "It's true. Father has already issued a decree. When the body is returned to the capital, he will posthumously confer the title. Lin'an, remember your status."

A princess of the Great Feng, losing composure over the death of a subordinate like this was unbecoming. The Crown Prince assumed Lin'an was simply sentimental and didn't want to think deeper into it.

Lin'an silently withdrew her hand, stood up without a word, and walked into the snowstorm.

"Lin'an, Lin'an..." The Crown Prince called after her, but she kept walking.

That red figure walked on, snowflakes landing on her hair.

The Crown Prince turned to Lin'an's maid and barked, "Why are you not holding an umbrella for the princess."

The maid, who had just picked up the umbrella, hesitated at his words, bowed, and hurriedly followed Lin'an.

In the pavilion, the other princes and princesses were still in a daze, their expressions puzzled.

Meanwhile, the maid, who had once been spanked by Xu Qi'an, held the umbrella and cautiously glanced at Lin'an's profile, not daring to speak.

*What a pity that Bronze Gong died...* the maid sighed inwardly.

Suddenly, she heard soft sobs and looked in surprise to see Lin'an's face covered in tears.

"Princess?!"

The maid's voice trembled as she called out, anxiously glancing around. Fortunately, the snowstorm ensured no one was around. She lowered her voice, "Why are you crying? Is it because of him?"

"I don't, I don't know...." Lin'an murmured, tears falling as she clutched her chest. 

It felt empty there.

…

"It's snowing! I love snowy days. When the snow stops, I can have a snowball fight with my senior brothers and build snowmen and snow horses."

At Princess Huaiqing's residence, in a warm tea room, Chu Caiwei held a cup of tea and ate pastries while gazing at the heavy snow outside.

She had a slight dimple and enjoyed the leisurely afternoon with hot tea, delicious pastries, and a snowy view.

Princess Huaiqing, dressed in a white palace gown, was wearing summer attire that accentuated her figure, as she had long been immune to the cold.

Ignoring her friend's chatter, she held a book in her hand but was lost in thought as she gazed at the snow.

"Princess Huaiqing, what's wrong with you these days? You've been so absent-minded," Chu Caiwei said, feeling ignored and annoyed.

Princess Huaiqing, her bright eyes reflecting the white snowflakes, said softly, "Caiwei, the letter we wrote for you may never reach its destination."

Chu Caiwei, still munching on pastries, asked, "Why?"

"He... has fallen in the line of duty."

Chu Caiwei's hand trembled, and the pastry fell to the ground.

...

At the Stargazing Tower, on the Bagua Platform.

Chu Caiwei, feeling dejected, climbed the steps to the top of the Stargazing Tower.

The heavy snow was falling, covering the Bagua Platform with a thin layer of snow. The Jianzheng was sitting cross-legged in front of the desk, and within a radius of three feet, no snowflakes fell.

Chu Caiwei stopped behind Jianzheng and, with a voice full of grievance, sobbed, "Teacher..."

"Ever since you were little, whenever a senior brother bullied you, you would come running here crying to tell me," Jianzheng said without turning around, smiling as he drank a cup of wine.

"No senior brother bullied me," Chu Caiwei pouted and then burst into tears, "Xu Qi'an is dead, Xu Qi'an is dead, and I'm so sad..."

Jianzheng was silent for a moment, then turned his gaze to the south, seemingly focused on something. Suddenly, he chuckled and said, "It's a good thing."

Chu Caiwei cried even harder, stomping her feet and cursing, "You old man, rotten old man, my friend is dead, and you say it's a good thing? Why don't you go die?"

"How can you talk to your teacher like that? I've lived for five hundred years and haven't lived enough yet. I want to borrow another five hundred years from heaven," Jianzheng said angrily.

"But... but what you just said doesn't seem like something a teacher should say," Chu Caiwei sobbed.

"If I say it's a good thing, then it's a good thing," Jianzheng said. "Remember the Pill of Rebirth I gave you a few years ago?"

"What Pill of Rebirth?" Chu Caiwei wiped her tears.

"The Pill of Rebirth, of which only three pills are made every sixty years. Even Emperor Yuanjing begged me for it, but I didn't give it to him," Jianzheng said, even more annoyed.

"Oh, it's in my pouch," Chu Caiwei sniffled. "I forgot about it. I don't have any use for it anyway."

Jianzheng nodded and smiled, "Remember, you gave the Pill of Rebirth to Xu Qi'an."

"I didn't."

"You did."

"I didn't; it's in my pouch."

"Shut up, you gave it. If anyone asks, just say that."

"Oh." Chu Caiwei continued to cry, "Teacher, Xu Qi'an is dead."

She had a habit of coming to Jianzheng to cry whenever she encountered something sad, just like a child would go to their parents to complain when they were wronged.

"You've just reached the sixth rank not long ago; don’t go out for the time being," Jianzheng instructed.

After Chu Caiwei left, Jianzheng opened his palm, revealing a translucent, orange pill.

Then he pulled out a white strand of hair and gently blew on it.

The strand of hair floated in the wind, rising higher and higher, suddenly expanding and transforming into a large white bird.

The bird let out a desolate cry, circled in the air, then dived down and grabbed the Pill of Rebirth from Jianzheng's hand.

...

"Do you trust Wei Yuan so much? Willing to tell him all your secrets?"

In the dimly lit cabin, Yang Qianhuan sat cross-legged, facing away from the coffin.

Xu Qi'an being Wei Yuan's illegitimate son was clearly false, as Xu Qi’an was twenty, and Wei Yuan had been a eunuch in the palace for over twenty years.

"Calling him 'Dad' was just a joke," Xu Qi'an sighed from inside the coffin. "Of course, I trust him. Duke Wei has been very kind to me, willing to cultivate me. It's no exaggeration to say he's been like a father. But I do feel a bit hesitant to tell him all my secrets."

"Why?" Yang Qianhuan asked.

"Well, Duke Wei's thoughts are too deep; you can never see through him. You never know what he's thinking or how he'll react if I tell him my secrets," Xu Qi'an explained.

"That's true. Wei Yuan and my teacher are both terrifyingly deep thinkers. Even someone like me, who can pluck the moon and stars, can't see through them," Yang Qianhuan admitted. "But, why are you willing to talk to me about your innermost thoughts?" 

"Because Senior Brother Yang is a man with a child's heart," Xu Qi'an said with a smile.

*Except for his penchant for showing off, he doesn't care about anything else.*

Yang Qianhuan nodded but then felt something was off, "It sounds like you're not complimenting me... Have you considered leaving the capital? After all, you're officially dead now; you could go anywhere."

"But my family is in the capital. If I can return, I want to," Xu Qi'an sighed. "I've always longed for the life of a wandering swordsman, but no matter where you go, having a home to return to is reassuring. If I leave the capital, I might never come back."

After spending some time together, perhaps out of boredom, the two had gone from casual banter to discussing more serious matters.

"That's true. When I'm away, just thinking about my senior and junior brothers and my teacher at the Sitianjian makes me feel secure. It's not really being homeless, just traveling," Yang Qianhuan nodded slightly.

Xu Qi'an's mention of consulting Wei Yuan was more to appease Yang Qianhuan, as he was still weighing the pros and cons of revealing his secrets.

Wei Yuan had been kind to him, but Xu Qi'an couldn't predict whether Wei Yuan would choose to re-seal the demon monk Shenshu or turn a blind eye to his existence if the secrets were revealed.

After all, he wasn't Wei Yuan's real son.

But he was also reluctant to leave the capital, feeling caught between a rock and a hard place.

Additionally, the demon monk Shenshu had instructed him to keep his existence a secret, and Xu Qi'an couldn't predict Shenshu's reaction if the secret were revealed to Wei Yuan.

Just because a powerful figure always wore a kind face didn't mean they were a benevolent saint.

"Hey, Pos… Senior Brother Yang, are you married?" Xu Qi'an asked.

"No," Yang Qianhuan shook his head. "Women are a burden; I don't need one."

*I see. I was wondering if you'd not allow your wife to look at you during... Well, if so, you'd have two choices: either become like the lesser saint of the Cloud Deer Academy, always standing behind your wife, or become a man of strong moral character,* Xu Qi'an thought, chuckling to himself.

Just then, a desolate bird's call sounded from outside the boat, echoing like an owl's lament.

Yang Qianhuan was first stunned, then shocked, exclaiming, "That's my Teacher's aura."
