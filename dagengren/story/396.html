# 396. Waiting for Someone

Emperor Yuanjing put away the note and instructed, “Inform Wei Yuan to enter the palace and meet me… No, never mind.”

The old emperor, who had just experienced the “ups and downs” of life, pondered for a long time before saying, “Notify King Huai’s spies to head to Jianzhou immediately and compete for the Nine-Coloured Lotus Seeds. They may cooperate with the Daoists of the Earth Sect.”

After a pause, he added, “Make sure to bring extra magical artefacts.”

The old eunuch bowed and withdrew.

……….

Jianzhou was located in the northwestern region of Great Feng, bordering Leizhou to the west and Jiangzhou to the north. Because two major canal routes passed through Jianzhou, it had long flourished in trade.

However, what Jianzhou was most renowned for was its unique cultural heritage—the Wulin Alliance.

Throughout history, imperial dynasties had followed a consistent approach toward jianghu organisations: recruitment for the obedient, suppression or eradication for the defiant. Only in this way could a dynasty maintain its rule and ensure stability.

Yet, exceptions always existed.

The Wulin Alliance of Jianzhou was one such exception—it was a jianghu organisation that, to a certain extent, stood unafraid of the imperial court.

Jianzhou had long possessed a deep-rooted martial culture, filled with countless sects and clans, some of which had endured for centuries. These groups all fell under the control of the Wulin Alliance.

But these martial sects alone were not enough to support the Wulin Alliance’s current status. To trace its true origins, one had to turn to history books.

During the waning years of the Great Zhou dynasty, the common people suffered in misery, and countless factions rose in rebellion to overthrow the tyrannical rule. Before the founding emperor of Great Feng made his mark, he was merely one of many rebel leaders.

He gathered a force of several hundred soldiers, capturing small counties and gradually expanding his ranks.

At that time, some rebel factions had already gained significant momentum, possessing strong military forces capable of establishing independent rule. One such faction was based in Jianzhou.

The leader of the Jianzhou rebels was a third-rank martial artist, who rose to prominence amidst the chaos, fighting countless battles without suffering a single defeat.

Later, as the founding emperor of Great Feng ascended to power and became one of the primary forces in toppling the tyrannical rule, the old Zhou dynasty fell. The various righteous factions vied for control over the Central Plains. Though the old imperial court had been overthrown, further bloodshed loomed on the horizon. To prevent unnecessary slaughter, the third-rank warrior of Jianzhou issued a challenge to the founding emperor of Great Feng.

The stakes were their respective armies—a duel between martial artists to determine the victor.

The result was predictable. The third-rank warrior of Jianzhou lost. As per their agreement, he handed over his army to the founding emperor of Great Feng and left with only his closest followers, returning to Jianzhou to establish the Wulin Alliance.

That warrior had long since vanished into history, yet the Wulin Alliance continued to claim that he still lived. This belief was the true foundation of the Wulin Alliance’s confidence.

*So the Wulin Alliance was originally a rebel army...*

By candlelight, seated at his desk, Xu Qi’an closed the dossier he had retrieved from the Nightwatchers’ archives. He had noticed a flaw that could not be ignored.

*According to these records, the Wulin Alliance’s founder, that third-rank expert, lost to the founding emperor of Great Feng. But the founding emperor has long returned to dust—how is it possible that this man still lives?*

*It makes no sense for the stronger fighter to die while the weaker one survives. We’re all martial artists, crude and unrefined—what made him special enough to live for centuries?*

Following this line of thought, Xu Qi’an suddenly realised something he had overlooked before. When Emperor Wuzong had staged a coup under the pretext of "purging traitors," he had already reached the pinnacle of martial cultivation.

Yet, a hundred years later, he simply passed away from old age…

*Judging from both the founding emperor and Emperor Wuzong’s fates, it seems that martial artists are not long-lived. But if that’s the case, how has that ruffian from Jianzhou lived for centuries?*

*Could it be that the Wulin Alliance is just bluffing, deceiving the world?*

*Impossible. A mere lie might fool the common folk, but it could never deceive the imperial court. The fact that the court tolerated the Wulin Alliance’s existence suggested that it harboured some degree of apprehension. That legendary rebel leader might truly still be alive…*

*In that case, the issue lies with the imperial family of Great Feng. What prevents high-ranked martial artists in the royal lineage from achieving longevity?*

Xu Qi’an couldn’t figure it out, so he turned his head and asked the woman seated cross-legged on the soft couch. "Senior Sister Zhong, I just thought of something."

Zhong Li, her hair draped messily over her face, turned her head. Her eyes were hidden behind the stray locks as she gazed at him.

"How did the founding emperor of Great Feng die?"

"He just slowly grew old and passed away."

"…" Xu Qi’an choked for a moment before quickly following up, "But shouldn’t peak martial artists have longer lifespans than ordinary people?"

"I-I’m not a martial artist, so I don’t know…" Zhong Li murmured softly, feeling guilty for being unable to answer his question.

*Well, never mind. It wasn’t an urgent mystery that needed immediate resolution anyway…*

Xu Qi’an blew out the candle, took off his shoes, and climbed onto the bed. With a teasing smile, he said, "Want to sleep together?"

Senior Sister Zhong, still a chaste maiden, ignored him.

…

Jianzhou.

According to the *Geographical Records of Jiuzhou*, Jianzhou was home to a mountain where beasts roamed—creatures with human faces, six tails, and the ability to devour the moon, known as the "Quanrong."

Quanrong Mountain was the headquarters of the Wulin Alliance.

With her teacher and the Tower Master, Soul-Stealing Hand Rongrong travelled by carriage to Quanrong Mountain—the sacred ground of Jianzhou’s martial world.

The Tower Master of Wanhua Tower had brought along more than ten elite fighters in response to a summons.

Wanhua Tower was an all-female sect, its members renowned for their beauty and charm. Those with outstanding talent were trained as direct disciples, while those with lesser aptitude were married off to strengthen alliances.

For centuries, many of Jianzhou’s prominent sects had some degree of marital ties to Wanhua Tower.

"This time, your master is taking you out to broaden your horizons. Remember not to act recklessly—just observe from the sidelines," the beautiful woman instructed her disciple.

Even among a crowd of beauties, Rongrong stood out. She nodded obediently but then protested, "Master, I’m already sixth rank."

A sixth-rank cultivator, Bronze Skin and Iron Bones, was a formidable presence in the jianghu, earning respect wherever they went. Only in a martial haven like Jianzhou could such a rank seem mediocre.

Her master shook her head. "Sixth rank is insignificant. In the events ahead, I fear that only those at the fifth rank and above will be able to participate. Those below fifth rank will merely serve as cannon fodder."

A chill ran through Rongrong’s heart. In a hushed voice, she asked, "Master, what exactly is happening?"

Just then, their carriage arrived at the foot of Quanrong Mountain. The women of Wanhua Tower disembarked and looked up.

Quanrong Mountain was shrouded in mist, its jagged peaks sharp and imposing, its dense forests teeming with ancient trees. Scattered among the cliffs were pavilions and courtyards, partially veiled by the foliage.

As she lifted the hem of her dress and ascended the white marble steps, Rongrong heard her master whisper, "You’ve heard of the Earth Sect, haven’t you?"

Rongrong nodded.

The three Daoist Sects were regarded as the “supreme immortal factions” in the jianghu, their influence unmatched throughout Jiuzhou. Even the imperial court treaded carefully around their Daoist Leaders.

"The Tower Master heard that the Earth Sect has been cultivating a rare treasure in Jianzhou—a Nine-Coloured Lotus. Recently, the lotus ripened, casting radiant light into the skies. Alliance Leader Cao sought to claim the lotus root but was refused, leading to a fight with the Earth Sect Daoists.

"Afterwards, the Wulin Alliance summoned the major sects, intending to launch a siege on the Daoists."

Rongrong was shocked. "What is Alliance Leader Cao thinking? No matter how powerful the Wulin Alliance is, they cannot afford to offend the Earth Sect!"

Her master nodded worriedly, then hesitated before shaking her head again. "Alliance Leader Cao is a man of vision and ambition. If he dares to do this, he must have his reasons—we simply don’t know them yet."

Just then, the voice of the Tower Master rang out, soft yet commanding, "Silence."

Master and disciple fell quiet. Rongrong looked up at the Tower Master’s figure ahead.

The women of Wanhua Tower dressed revealingly, especially in the sweltering summer heat, their attire light and airy. From Rongrong’s angle, she had a clear view of the Tower Master’s full, rounded curves, her pert hips accentuated by the silk ribbon tied around her slender waist; above that, the graceful lines of her back flowed smoothly.

The Tower Master often veiled her face with a light gauze, revealing only a pair of fox-like, enchanting eyes. Her voluptuous figure had earned her the title of "Oiran" of Wanhua Tower, a testament to her undeniable allure.

Before long, they reached the mountain peak, where a steward of the alliance led them into a grand courtyard. The Tower Master of Wanhua Tower crossed the courtyard and entered the council hall, while the rest remained outside.

Rongrong subtly glanced around and spotted many familiar faces in the courtyard.

Those carrying swords on their backs were disciples of Ink Pavilion, including Young Master Liu and his teacher.

The ones dressed in azure robes belonged to the Divine Fist Gang, a group known for their structured fist techniques. Recently, they had recruited several bold and outspoken female disciples.

Clad in gold-and-crimson garments were members of the Thousand Mechanisms Sect, experts in hidden weapons and poisons, their methods sinister and difficult to counter.

Shrouded in black robes were people of the Flying Dagger Sect. Their daggers were both hidden weapons and not, depending on how they were wielded. It was said that the sect leader could control one hundred and eight flying daggers with ease.

In battle, their attacks were direct and unyielding, an impressive force.

Rongrong retracted her gaze. Just among those gathered, there were already more than eighteen martial sects. Anyone who answered the Wulin Alliance's call and came to this meeting was undoubtedly an expert—there were no small fry here.

*The Alliance Leader is determined to obtain the Nine-Coloured Lotus…* Rongrong mused.

………

Time passed second by second, and after more than an hour, the Tower Master of Wanhua Tower was the first to exit, followed by the other sect and gang leaders.

Through the open doors of the council hall, Rongrong saw a burly middle-aged man seated on a high chair. He wore a purple robe embroidered with layers of cloud patterns in golden thread.

She dared not look at the man’s face and quickly lowered her head, following behind the Tower Master and her fellow disciples as they left the courtyard.

Back at their assigned quarters, the Tower Master gathered a few elders, including the beautiful woman, Rongong’s teacher, for a private discussion.

By dusk, the beautiful woman returned. Rongrong immediately pulled her master into their room, shut the doors and windows, and pressed, “Master, what’s really going on?”

The beautiful woman pondered for a long time before slowly saying:

“The situation is clear now. The group of Earth Sect Daoists hiding in Jianzhou are traitors of the Earth Sect. They stole the Nine-Coloured Lotus and, under the ‘protection’ of the Wulin Alliance, have been lying low to avoid the Earth Sect’s pursuit.

“Not long ago, the treasure matured, and a phenomenon appeared. The Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect arrived in pursuit, but wary of the Wulin Alliance, he made an agreement with Alliance Leader Cao—they would jointly eliminate the Earth Sect traitors. The reward: a segment of lotus root.

“Alliance Leader Cao promised our Tower Master and the others that once the Nine-Coloured Lotus was cultivated to full maturity, all participants would receive lotus seeds. Heh, you might not know, but these lotus seeds are a rare treasure. They can awaken spirits in all things—even mundane iron could give birth to an artefact spirit.

“Of course, the lotus seeds only mature once every sixty years, a long cycle. So, Alliance Leader Cao has also offered other benefits.”

*Awaken spirits in all things…* Rongrong pursed her lips, her eyes flashing with undisguised desire.

*Such a supreme treasure—who wouldn’t crave it?*

She then frowned. “But if that’s the case, why did Alliance Leader Cao summon us? With the Wulin Alliance’s strength in Quanrong Mountain, joining forces with the Earth Sect should make it easy to wipe out those rogue Daoists.”

The beautiful woman nodded approvingly. “That group of defectors is indeed of no real concern—they can be crushed with ease. What Alliance Leader Cao truly fears is that the Earth Sect may renege on their agreement.”

Rongrong suddenly understood.

…

Meanwhile, in the Ink Pavilion quarters.

Young Master Liu exclaimed in excitement, “Those lotus seeds are truly that miraculous?”

His master, while meticulously wiping his beloved sword, nodded.

“Of course. It is the supreme treasure of the Daoist Earth Sect—no description of its wonders would be an exaggeration. If I can obtain a lotus seed, I will use it to awaken the spirit within this sword.”

Young Master Liu’s gaze immediately fell on the weapon that once belonged to him. Swallowing hard, he nodded resolutely. “The lotus seeds only mature every sixty years. Master, don’t worry, I will take good care of it.

“In the future, it will become our lineage’s peerless divine weapon, passed down through generations.”

His master did not refute him, merely nodding slightly with a smile. “The Pavilion Master said that the defected Earth Sect Daoists aren’t particularly strong, but we must not take them lightly. You should stay out of the battle this time and observe from the outskirts.”

Young Master Liu nodded firmly.

…

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

The local authorities in Jianzhou were astounded to find that, during this period, a large number of jianghu folk had flocked to the region.

They gathered in inns, taverns, and brothels, openly spreading rumours that a rare treasure was about to emerge in Jianzhou.

Only then did the Jianzhou Prefect realise the severity of the situation. The authorities detested jianghu folk converging in large numbers—it was a recipe for chaos.

He immediately mobilised the garrison troops to reinforce security, keeping them on standby outside the city at all times.

Afterwards, he sent people to gather intelligence and, surprisingly, found out the location of the treasure with little effort—it was in a manor on the outskirts of Jianzhou.

The Jianzhou authorities were relieved. As long as the fighting didn’t spill into the city, they had no interest in interfering. Let the jianghu warriors fight and kill each other to their hearts’ content.

In the manor, Daoist Jinlian stood atop a pavilion, gazing at the distant mountain path.

The fair-skinned and beautiful Bailian ascended to stand beside him, sighing helplessly. “Another group of jianghu people just got caught in the formation. The disciples knocked them out and tied them up.

“So far, we’ve captured dozens of them. These people don’t deserve death, but if we let them go, they’ll be a liability. What should we do?”

Daoist Jinlian sighed. “This is Heilian’s doing…”

If it were any other faction or organisation, they would have killed a few as a warning to the rest, deterring further troublemakers.

But Daoist Jinlian and his group couldn’t do that—the Earth Sect cultivated merit and virtue. Wanton killing would corrupt their hearts, giving rise to inner demons and leading them down the demonic path.

“Heilian knows this well, which is why he deliberately spread the news, drawing countless martial artists here.” Bailian brushed a strand of hair behind her ear, sighing again.

Daoist Jinlian, however, remained serene, as if everything was within his grasp. With a faint smile, he said, “No rush. We’re waiting for someone. When he arrives, most of these rabble will retreat on their own.”
