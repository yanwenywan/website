# 326. The Identity of the Body

“Stinky man! Is there a problem with this child’s brain?”

Susu dashed into the study, and only then did the prickling feeling on her back fade away. It was really odd—she had felt extremely uneasy under the gaze of a merely five- or six-year-old child.

“You’re the one with the problem. Your whole family has a problem. Oh, I forgot, your entire family has already been executed.”

Xu Qi’an retorted mercilessly, having long forgotten Auntie’s casual joke, assuming that Susu was mocking Little Pea.

“Creak…”

Xu Qi’an closed the door to the study. He initially thought to pour Li Miaozhen a cup of tea, but considering that there might be a need for an autopsy soon, it wasn’t the right moment for tea. Thus, he didn’t serve any.

Li Miaozhen, not wasting words, pulled out a fragment of the Earth Book, giving it a light shake. A dark shadow fell down and landed with a “thud” on the study floor.

Xu Qi’an’s sharp senses detected a strong scent of blood.

He stared at the headless corpse for a moment before asking, “What about his soul?”

A headless body alone didn’t reveal much. Since Li Miaozhen had said it was a major matter, she had likely used Daoist methods to summon the soul.

Li Miaozhen patted her sachet, releasing a wisp of azure smoke that formed mid-air into the dazed, indistinct figure of a middle-aged man. He muttered, “Blood runs three thousand miles… blood runs three thousand miles… we plead the court, send troops to suppress…”

The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect had a grave expression. “His soul is damaged. If you want to know the rest, you’ll have to nourish it. Judging by the degree of fragmentation, it will take at least two months.”

Xu Qi’an glanced at her, snorted, and said, “Two months from now, the trail will be ice-cold.”

Li Miaozhen glared, “Then what do you suggest?”

She truly had no idea what to do. With only this single clue, headless and incomplete, how could the truth be uncovered?

Susu’s beautiful eyes, clear as black and white, settled on him expectantly. She knew that with Xu Qi’an’s talent for solving cases, he wouldn’t be as clueless as her master.

Susu was both hopeful and curious to see what angle he would take in his analysis.

After a brief moment of thought, Xu Qi’an bent down and removed the corpse’s clothing. After a thorough examination, he said, “If I'm not mistaken, he should be a northerner.”

Li Miaozhen’s eyes immediately lit up. “On what grounds?” she asked.

She had observed shameless Number Three's entire examination but had not drawn the same conclusion.

“Every region’s land nurtures its own people. From appearance and skin, you can determine where someone is from. Without a head, and with the ghost’s face too blurry... To determine where this headless corpse is from, we have to verify through body details.”

Xu Qi’an lifted the corpse’s right hand. “Look here. Besides the calluses on his palm, his index finger has a thick layer of callus as well. Using a sabre or sword wouldn’t cause this kind of callus.”

Susu and Li Miaozhen both scrutinised the finger and found it to be true.

The stunning ghost blinked her beautiful eyes and asked coquettishly, “Then what weapon did he use? Don’t keep us in suspense.”

Li Miaozhen, however, showed a look of realisation. “A bow.”

*Indeed, as a general with the military, she reacts quickly...* Xu Qi’an nodded. “Correct, he was a skilled shot.”

Susu tilted her head sceptically. “How does that prove he’s from the north? It sounds like you’re making things up. There are plenty of people skilled with a bow. Couldn’t he have been from the army?”

Li Miaozhen nodded in agreement.

“Yes, Miss Susu makes a good point. For example, there's someone skilled with shooting right beside you who isn’t in the army.”

Xu Qi’an waggled his eyebrows playfully, his hands moving without pause as he parted the corpse’s legs. “Look closely here. There are no calluses on the insides of his thighs. If he were a soldier accustomed to long-term horse riding, his thighs would definitely have calluses. He’s not a military man, yet he’s proficient with a bow. This matches the characteristics of northern folk. Among the martial artists of Great Feng, those outside the north rarely favour the bow.”

In the north, people were adept with bows. Even an ordinary man there can draw one. From what Xu Qi’an knew, the martial artists in the northern regions commonly carried both a sabre and a bow. 

Sometimes, they might even forego the sabre, using daggers or broken blades instead, but they would never go without a bow.

At this point, Susu came up with another counterargument. “Or perhaps he was an archer?”

Xu Qi’an chuckled. “Who would send an archer to deliver a message? If I'm not mistaken, this man was most likely a martial artist from the northern region. As to what he was trying to convey, who sent him, and who took his life—that I can’t say.”

Li Miaozhen let out a silent sigh of relief and said, with some satisfaction, “Then I’ll leave the matter to you. As a Silver Gong of the Nightwatchers, it’s your duty to handle these affairs.”

Susu also let out a small breath, feeling that while this stinky man was lecherous and annoying, his skills were undeniably impressive.

His analysis was well-founded, and she grudgingly admired it.

She and her master had been entirely stumped, with no idea how to proceed, but once it was handed over to this man, they immediately had a lead.

Even though Susu often complained about Li Miaozhen’s tendency to meddle, and despite her penchant for draining men’s vitality, she knew she herself was a kind-hearted ghost.

If the matter of the headless corpse wasn’t handled properly, both she and Li Miaozhen would be left burdened with it.

Thus, this highlighted Xu Qi’an’s strengths. He could bring just a small sense of security.

…

Having arranged guest rooms for Li Miaozhen and Susu, and instructing the cook to prepare some snacks, Xu Qi'an returned to the study, placed the corpse into the jade fragment, retrieved the remnants of the soul, and rode his little mare to the Constabulary.

*I remember that Duke Wei mentioned how the northern front has been in constant turmoil. The Great Feng has suffered consecutive defeats. Civil officials impeached the Zhenbei King, but Emperor Yuanjing forcefully shifted the blame onto Wei Yuan, stripping him of his position as Deputy Chief Censor.*

*Blood runs three thousand miles… It's unimaginable. Such a major incident... Why hadn't I heard of it before? This is a matter of grave importance. I need to report to Wei Yuan immediately.*

Riding his mare at full speed, Xu Qi'an arrived at the Constabulary, handed the reins to the clerk on duty at the entrance, and hurried to the Tower of Noble Spirit.

“Silver Gong Xu, Duke Wei just ordered a carriage to be prepared. He’s about to enter the palace,” the guard downstairs informed him.

*Heading to the palace... Going to the palace means more squabbles with Emperor Yuanjing and the civil officials—a waste of time...* Xu Qi'an’s face turned stern. “Spare me the idle talk, go announce my arrival.”

“Yes, sir...” The guard obediently ran into the building.

After receiving confirmation from the guard, Xu Qi'an ascended the steps with a hand on his saber. He saw Wei Yuan sitting behind his desk, his eyes, seasoned by time, gazing at him calmly with a touch of warmth.

He was still dressed in azure robes, but now embroidered with intricate cloud patterns, with an azure river dragon stitched over his chest.

This was Wei Yuan's court attire, worn when attending court or meeting the emperor.

“You have the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. If you have something to say, say it quick.” When addressing his confidants, Wei Yuan’s tone was rarely polite.

“Since Duke Wei is in such a hurry, I’ll get straight to the point.” Xu Qi'an wasn't in a good mood either. He immediately produced the jade fragment and gave it a light shake.

With a thud, a headless corpse fell onto the clean floor of the tidy tea room, sullying its immaculate appearance.

Wei Yuan was slightly taken aback, a muscle near his eye twitching as he spoke in a low tone, “What is the meaning of this?”

“Li Miaozhen arrived in the capital today and is currently staying at my residence,” Xu Qi'an explained.

“Mm.”

Wei Yuan nodded, showing no particular interest in that fact. His gaze remained fixed on the headless corpse as he asked indifferently, “And what does this have to do with the corpse?”

Xu Qi'an grinned. “It's very relevant. This corpse was found eighty li outside the capital, decapitated with a single, clean stroke. 

“Li Miaozhen, being someone who loves to meddle, summoned the remnants of the soul to inquire about the circumstances. But...”

He deliberately paused, wanting to keep Wei Yuan in suspense, but seeing his superior’s expression darken, Xu Qi'an’s heart skipped a beat. Fearing his next month’s wages might get deducted for stepping out with the left foot first, he hurriedly continued:

“The spirit said something... Well, Duke Wei, see for yourself.”

He took out the sachet given by Li Miaozhen, untied the red string, and a wisp of azure smoke drifted up, forming the vague figure of a blank-faced, vacant-eyed man in mid-air. The spirit repeated in a murmur:

“Blood runs three thousand miles… blood runs three thousand miles… we plead the court… send troops… to suppress…”

Wei Yuan's pupils contracted sharply as he fixed his gaze on the lingering spirit, his eyes sharp as daggers.

He was silent for a few moments before saying, “What clues do you have?”

It wasn’t a question but a statement. He seemed certain that Xu Qi'an must have discovered something.

As expected, his favored Silver Gong never disappointed. Xu Qi'an reported, “Based on my initial deductions, I believe he’s a northerner, killed while traveling to the capital with important news.”

He recounted his reasoning in detail.

“There has been no recent warfare in the Great Feng, except in the northern regions. Duke Wei, the situation up north might be worse than we imagine. And yet the court has received no reports?”

“None.”

Wei Yuan shook his head, his brows furrowed slightly. “Are you suggesting that the Zhenbei King is falsifying military reports?”

Xu Qi'an glanced at Wei Yuan. “That wouldn’t be surprising. What baffles me is, if the Zhenbei King is lying about the state of the front, why hasn’t the Constabulary received any intelligence?”

The Nightwatchers’ informants were scattered across Jiuzhou. An incident as significant as a bloodbath running over three thousand miles shouldn’t go entirely unnoticed.

“At the beginning of the year, I reassigned most of our agents to the northeast. Only a few remain in the north, so information may be delayed,” Wei Yuan said with a hint of helplessness.

*So Duke Wei has moved the agents to the northeast? Is he planning to deal with the Church of the Warlock God...* Xu Qi'an understood and stopped pressing. “What does Duke Wei intend to do about this?”

Wei Yuan glanced at the water clock in the corner and said, “I must first enter the palace to see the emperor. I’ll take both the corpse and the spirit fragment with me. You don’t need to concern yourself further with this matter.”

After Xu Qi'an nodded in agreement, Wei Yuan added, “Since Li Miaozhen has arrived in the capital, the Conflict of Heaven and Man will soon conclude, and the capital’s security should improve.

“During this period, who knows how many spies have infiltrated the city. Fortunately, with the Jianzheng’s oversight, they can’t cause much trouble.

“Make sure to warn Li Miaozhen to be cautious. This is a sensitive time. Tell her not to leave the city recklessly and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Be on guard for potential dangers.”

“Potential dangers?” Xu Qi'an asked.

Wei Yuan glanced at the water clock once more, and with rapid speech, said, “I’ll tell you only this: the dangers she might face are twofold—first, from the court; second, from foreign spies. Think about the reasons yourself. I really must go now.”

He snatched the sachet from Xu Qi'an's hand, strode out of the tea room, and instructed the clerks, “Bring the corpse. We’re entering the palace.”

...

The Imperial Study.

Aside from Emperor Yuanjing, there were Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen, the Minister of Revenue, and other third-rank officials, dukes, and nobles—sixteen in total.

Chu Xianglong, pale-faced, stood among them with his head slightly lowered, saying nothing.

He had taken the pills provided by the arcanists of the Sitianjian, which quickly allowed him to stand up on his own. However, with his meridians severely damaged, he couldn’t recover quickly. With proper rest and avoiding qi circulation, he’d be fine in about a month.

Emperor Yuanjing frowned. “Wei Yuan isn’t here yet. No need to wait!”

Then he swept his gaze over the gathered officials. “The Zhenbei King has requested three hundred thousand taels of military funds, and an additional two hundred and fifty thousand *dan* of grain, fodder, and supplies. What do you all think?”

The Minister of Revenue was the first to step forward in opposition. “In the 36th year of Yuanjing, there was severe flooding in Jiangzhou; In Jingzhou, a drought; followed by suffered a locust plague, and the court provided disaster relief multiple times.

“The surplus in the granaries of Yuzhou and Zhangzhou are nearly depleted. We simply cannot gather more.”

Emperor Yuanjing mused, “What about mobilizing supplies from other provinces?”

The Minister of Revenue replied, “Even with river transport, gathering supplies from various provinces is time-consuming and labour-intensive. By the time it reaches the border in Chuzhou, less than half would remain. It’s not a viable plan.”

As he spoke, a eunuch arrived at the entrance of the Imperial Study and paused.

Emperor Yuanjing raised his hand slightly, interrupting the Minister of Revenue, and looked towards the eunuch standing at the door: “What is it?”

“Duke Wei has arrived,” the eunuch reported.

Emperor Yuanjing's expression remained impassive. “Let him in.”

The eunuch withdrew, and a dozen seconds later, Wei Yuan stepped into the Imperial Study, taking his usual place without making a single sound.

Emperor Yuanjing's tone turned impatient. “This is no good, that is no good—are my ministers only here to contradict Us?”

Yuan Xiong, the Left Censor-in-Chief, sensed an opportunity and stepped forward. “Your Majesty, I have a suggestion.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded. “Speak, Lord Yuan.”

Yuan Xiong said, “The court can temporarily impose a new corvée, called the Grain Transport Draft. The common folk would be tasked with escorting the grain.”

Emperor Yuanjing’s eyes brighte
ned slightly. It was indeed a clever plan.

The corvée, after all, was an unpaid service demanded by the court from all social classes. If the commoners were responsible for transporting the grain, with the soldiers supervising, the court would only need to cover the expenses for the soldiers, while the common folk would provide their own food.

This way, not only could they ensure that the grain would not be depleted before reaching the frontier, but they would also save a significant amount of transportation costs.

“This is a sound strategy!” Emperor Yuanjing said with a smile.

Yuan Xiong let out a breath of relief. As long as the Emperor adopted his proposal, the favor of the Dragon Throne would be restored. This way, the repercussions from the Imperial Examination Scandal would be minimised.

After the Palace Exam, if Xu Xinnian performed well, it was inevitable that Zhao Tingfang, the Prime Minister of the Eastern Pavilion, would retaliate, with Wei Yuan adding fuel to the fire.

Yuan Xiong had only recently secured his position as the Left Censor-in-Chief, and there was a chance he might lose it. He needed to protect himself.

Prime Minister Wang stepped forward, bowing: “This plan is a disaster for the nation, Yuan Xiong deserves punishment!

“Your Majesty, it is now the spring ploughing season, the busiest time for the farmers. We must not add another corvée. Since ancient times, the people have relied on food as their primary concern, and nothing should disturb them during spring ploughing.

“Furthermore, last year's disasters were severe, and the common people have little surplus grain left. This proposal is akin to pouring oil on the fire, driving the people to their doom.”

Yuan Xiong’s brows twitched, ready to retort, when Chu Xianglong sneered, “Prime Minister Wang, your compassion for the people is admirable. But do the commoners of Chuzhou not count as citizens of the Great Feng as well?

“Does the Prime Minister Wang disregard their lives entirely?”

Prime Minister Wang calmly replied, “The court has stationed 86,000 households of troops in the northern regions, each household granted six *mu* of fertile land. The military fields amount to five thousand *qing*.[^1] Each year…

“…Chuzhou has been free of major conflicts for years, and the region has enjoyed favorable weather for several years running. Even without any grain requisitions, based on Chuzhou’s stored reserves, they could hold out for several months. Why, then, are we suddenly short on funds and supplies?

“Could it be that certain individuals have encroached upon these military lands?”

Chuzhou was the northernmost province of Great Feng, bordering the territories of the northern barbarians.

Chu Xianglong, relying on his support from a royal king, showed no fear and scoffed, “Scholars only know how to move their mouths. Have any of you ever fought in a battle, or led troops? You sit here enjoying the comforts of the capital, oblivious to the hardships endured by the border soldiers.

“Your Majesty, the barbarian tribes have launched several major attacks since the end of last year. His Highness is exceptionally brave, achieving victory after victory. If a lack of supplies causes us to miss our window of opportunity, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded. “The martial prowess of the Zhenbei King is known to Us. What is the current state of the war in the north?”

Chu Xianglong clasped his hands and said, “His Highness’s military ability is unparalleled, his bravery unmatched. After several crushing defeats, the barbarians do not dare to face our forces head-on.

“They can only rely on the mobility of their cavalry to raid and harass. While we hold the upper hand, our soldiers are growing exhausted. I urge Your Majesty to release funds and supplies to show the troops that the court remembers their deeds.”

Prime Minister Wang frowned.

After the end-of-year impeachment of the Zhenbei King for refusing to leave the city to engage the enemy, the reports from the northern frontlines indeed indicated that the Zhenbei King had won several victories, curbing the barbarian incursions.

The Duke of Cao spoke up immediately: “The Zhenbei King has rendered great service, and we must not hinder him. Your Majesty, the Grain Transport Draft is a mutually beneficial solution. Moreover, if the pay is not delivered, there may be mutiny within the army, leading to a larger crisis.

“Even if there are flaws in the proposal, they can be addressed in the autumn. Now is not the time to withhold grain and pay.”

Several other noblemen echoed their support.

In matters of war, they were the experts, more authoritative than the civilian officials.

Prime Minister Wang said gravely, “Your Majesty, this matter requires careful deliberation.”

Emperor Yuanjing ignored him and asked, “What do my lords think?”

Seeing this, the officials one by one relented, answering, “We will give our full support to the Zhenbei King.”

The Emperor’s preference was clear, and it was pointless to argue further.

Several of the core members of the Wang Clique discreetly signalled to Prime Minister Wang to exercise caution. The Emperor’s trust in the Zhenbei King was well known throughout the court.

Otherwise, the Zhenbei King would never have been granted the Sword of State back then.

Emperor Yuanjing turned to Wei Yuan. “Lord Wei, you are a master of military strategy. What is your opinion?”

Prime Minister Wang immediately looked towards Wei Yuan.
