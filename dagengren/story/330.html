# 330. Xu Qi'an: No One Can Fleece Me

“As someone blessed with great fortune, your intuition is quite sharp.” The orange cat chuckled softly.

“What?”

Xu Qi’an looked at it in surprise. *This person... this cat was able to say something so shameless with such boldness and honesty.*

He answered cautiously, “Daoist, you have the right to speak, but never forget—I have the right to refuse.”

“I want you to help stop the Conflict of Heaven and Man.” The orange cat got straight to the point, delivering its words like a bolt from the blue.

After a few moments of silence, Xu Qi’an nodded steadily. “Tell me your thoughts and reasons.”

“Do you know why the Conflict of Heaven and Man exists?” The orange cat jumped onto a stone table, crouching there as its amber eyes fixed on Xu Qi’an.

“It’s a struggle for orthodoxy,” Xu Qi’an replied.

The orange cat gave a slight nod, then shook its head. “It’s said that long ago, the two founders of the Human Sect and the Heaven Sect clashed during a debate on Dao, both sustaining severe injuries. They returned to their respective sects and soon passed away.

“They left behind the same final words: every sixty years, a Conflict of Heaven and Man.

“For thousands of years since, the leaders of the Human Sect and the Heaven Sect have duelled every sixty years—sometimes with fatal consequences, sometimes merely injured, and occasionally ending in a draw.

“Gradually, a tradition formed: before the leaders’ clash, each sect’s outstanding disciples would battle in their stead. The victorious side would earn three initial, unchallenged moves in the final duel.”

Xu Qi’an furrowed his brow. “I heard from Miaozhen that there’s a deeper secret behind the Conflict of Heaven and Man. Do you know anything about it, Daoist?”

The orange cat glanced at him askance, a faint smile in its voice. “If I said I didn’t know, would that mean you wouldn’t agree?”

With the same faintly mocking tone, Xu Qi’an replied, “If I didn’t agree, would that mean you wouldn’t tell me?”

“The true reason is known only to the leaders of the Human Sect and the Heaven Sect. However, clues from countless years allow for some speculation,” the orange cat said, pausing for a few seconds before continuing:

“About two thousand years ago, a Sect Leader of the Heaven Sect went into seclusion to cultivate and missed the Conflict of Heaven and Man. Afterward... he vanished.

“Six hundred years ago, another the Heaven Sect Leader, for some unknown reason, ventured alone into the primary altar of the Church of the Warlock God. Severely wounded, he missed the Conflict of Heaven and Man during his recovery—and he, too, disappeared.

“As for the Human Sect, they have never produced a first rank Earthly Immortal, but every Human Sect Leader who triumphed in the Conflict of Heaven and Man would immediately attempt to ascend to first rank soon after.”

*Missing the Conflict of Heaven and Man leads to the disappearance of the the Heaven Sect leaders...* *Winning the Conflict of Heaven and Man leads the Human Sect’s leaders to swiftly pursue the first rank? What in the world is going on?* Xu Qi’an found himself realising that the waters of the Daoist world were deeper than he’d imagined.

“You still haven’t told me your reason,” Xu Qi’an said, pulling his thoughts back and fixing his gaze on the orange cat.

These secrets behind the Conflict of Heaven and Man were not the reason why Daoist Jinlian wanted him to stop Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen.

“I made a pact with Luo Yuheng,” the orange cat said, its gaze growing solemn. “She will aid me in the future when it’s time to cleanse the ranks of the Earth Sect. Therefore, I want to delay the conflict between the Heaven and Human Sects. Until the matter with the Earth Sect’s Patriarch is settled, I don’t want her to be put at risk. If the Conflict of Heaven and Man proceeds as scheduled, Luo Yuheng is unlikely to survive.”

There was a heavy and serious look in the orange cat’s eyes.

*Daoist Jinlian is a true disciple of Earth Sect, willing to go to such lengths to cleanse his house...* Xu Qi’an felt a tinge of admiration for the Daoist’s sense of duty. Yet he still couldn’t see how he could help with this matter.

“But how could a mere Silver Gong like me stop the Conflict of Heaven and Man?” He spread his hands helplessly.

“I’m not asking you to stop the leaders of the Heaven Sect and the Human Sect,” Daoist Jinlian coaxed, “but you could stop Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen.

“Sir Xu, don’t you want a chance to make a name for yourself? Don’t you want to shine in front of the gathered martial artists in the capital, to steal the spotlight?”

*I’m not Yang Qianhuan; I don’t care about showing off...* Xu Qi’an raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Are you suggesting I participate in the Conflict of Heaven and Man? That’s not a good idea. First, I can’t beat them. Second, even if I manage to disrupt the duel three days from now, what about five days later? Ten days later?

“Daoist, your plan won’t work.”

The orange cat shook its head gently, taking on the tone of a mentor guiding a younger student. “One must have a strategy when making a move. You can’t just rush in unprepared or without reason—otherwise, Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen won’t take you seriously. Even if you’re lucky enough to disrupt the fight, you can’t stop future duels.

“However, you can create a reason for yourself.”

“A reason?” Xu Qi’an echoed.

“For example, you could claim that the conflict between the Heaven Sect and the Human Sect seems insignificant to you, that their disciples are hardly worth mentioning, and that you’re eager for a challenge. Then, in front of all those martial artists, you can issue a challenge to them: if they can defeat you, the Conflict of Heaven and Man will continue. If not, then it should be postponed until they can defeat you.”

Xu Qi’an was left speechless. “Can you really do that? Such a contrived excuse...”

Daoist Jinlian chuckled. “That’s because you’ve never roamed the Jianghu. In the martial world, when issuing a challenge, it’s often done bluntly. If someone doesn’t accept, you simply humiliate them until they do.

“This is the polite way. The less civil approach would be to storm into their territory or smash their halls.

“Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen both have high opinions of themselves. If you publicly humiliate them, they’ll likely accept your challenge. Once they do, the agreement is set. Even the elders of the Heaven Sect wouldn’t have much to say—they would just pressure Li Miaozhen to end it quickly.”

*The elders of the Heaven Sect wouldn’t all come down from the mountains to slap me one by one, would they?* Xu Qi’an asked, “If Li Miaozhen can’t beat me, does that mean the Conflict of Heaven and Man won’t happen?”

The orange cat gave him another sidelong glance. “One thing I admire about you, Sir Xu, is your confidence. I’ve said before, the Conflict of Heaven and Man cannot be stopped, but it can be delayed. If you can buy us a year or so, that’s enough.

“Of course, this will certainly offend the Heaven Sect. But for you, it’s nothing you can’t handle.”

*It’s either that I’m fine, or you’re insisting that I’m fine…* Xu Qi’an’s face darkened. “Why?”

The orange cat chuckled softly. “Because you’re young enough. Because you have a rapport with Li Miaozhen. If it were someone else trying to get involved, the elders of the Heaven Sect might not personally intervene, but they would certainly order Li Miaozhen to kill any intruders. They might even bestow upon her powerful artefacts and elixirs. Don’t doubt it—Heaven Sect Daoists can be quite cold.”

“What’s in it for me?” Xu Qi’an asked.

“Trust me, if Luo Yuheng survives, you will receive an unimaginable reward in the future. That’s one of the reasons I’m asking for your help.” The orange cat spoke with a leisurely air.

*This damn cat is dangling yet another promise before me...* Xu Qi’an hesitated for a moment and then said, “I need some time to think about it.”

The orange cat nodded patiently.

Xu Qi’an sat down at the stone table, weighing the pros and cons of getting involved.

*Let’s set aside the empty promises (that so-called ‘unimaginable reward’).*

*In the duel between Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen, it’s not just a friendly spar—it’s a life-and-death battle bound by their sects’ missions. Especially Chu Yuanzhen. Though not a true disciple of the Human Sect, his sword techniques stem from there. He owes a debt to that lineage and will fight with everything he has to secure three preemptive strikes for Luo Yuheng.*

*Li Miaozhen’s character is upright and uncompromising—asking her to hold back in the Conflict of Heaven and Man would be nearly impossible. It’s not just about her personality; it’s also about the Heaven Sect’s reputation.*

*The best outcome would be a draw with both sides suffering injuries. The worst? One dead, one severely wounded.*

*But if I can prevent the Conflict of Heaven and Man, that outcome can be avoided.*

*The problem is, I’m just a Sixth-Rank martial artist, while those two are formidable Fourth-Ranks. However... with the nourishment I’ve gained from the blood of Monk Shenshu, my Vajra body has far surpassed its expected level.*

*In terms of combat power, I might be stronger than a typical Sixth-Rank, though certainly not enough to match a Fifth-Rank, let alone a Fourth-Rank. But when it comes to defense... even Fourth-Ranks might not match me.*

*Daoist Jinlian seems so sure I can help. It’s almost as if he’s seen through me... Did he notice something that day when I sparred with Li Miaozhen?*

“Daoist, I understand your reasoning. Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen are both members of the Heaven and Earth Society, but because of their sects’ commands, they won’t hold back. Any casualties would be a loss to us all.” Xu Qi’an sighed.

The orange cat, satisfied, gave a nod—like an adult who had successfully coaxed a child.

“As for the resentment from Heaven Sect elders, I trust it won’t be too severe. Daoist, you wouldn’t lead me into harm’s way.” Xu Qi’an said.

The orange cat nodded again with a smile.

“Therefore, I refuse.” Xu Qi’an concluded.

The orange cat’s smile froze.

“Why?” The cat’s tone grew anxious. “Xu Qi’an, mutual assistance is the foundation of the Heaven and Earth Society.”

*So, when you need me, I’m Sir Xu; otherwise, I’m just Xu Qi’an...* Xu Qi’an recounted his bitter experiences. “Last time we went to rescue Lina, we nearly died underground. Didn’t gain any benefits, and almost lost our lives.”

“You did absorb the fortune from the Jade Seal.” The orange cat lifted its front paw and tapped the table.

“And what about this time? What would I gain?” Xu Qi’an lamented. “Daoist, you should know my reputation wasn’t easily earned. The citizens of the capital admire me, seeing me as a hero of the Great Feng.

“Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen are far stronger than I am. If you want me to get beaten up, it would tarnish my reputation—the same reputation I earned when I single-handedly faced down thousands of rebels. The same reputation I earned when I bested the Buddhists.”

The orange cat sighed. “What do you want?”

Xu Qi’an’s face broke into a genuine smile. “Two conditions. First, I want a treasure. I haven’t decided what yet, so you’ll owe me one. But when I do ask for it, you can’t refuse.”

The orange cat pondered briefly, then nodded. “But you can’t make unreasonable demands… Fine. What’s the second condition?”

Xu Qi’an straightened his expression. “I want an Azure Pill.”

“!!!”

The orange cat raised its paw and struck the table three times, saying indignantly: “That’s impossible. An Azure Pill is like a Rebirth Pill—only three can be refined in sixty years. The difficulty of crafting a Rebirth Pill lies in finding the ingredients, but the Azure Pill is even harder to make. It requires rare materials, and the refining process is incredibly intricate. Its cost is several times that of a Rebirth Pill.”

*This kid should realise, if this old Daoist had an Azure Pill in his possession, I wouldn’t have needed to send you to Lingbao Temple to ask Luo Yuheng for one, right?*

The Earth Sect lacked nothing—except money.

Xu Qi’an rubbed his hands together and smiled warmly. “Daoist, your words sound so formal. We’re from the same organisation—how could I take advantage of you like that?

“You don’t have an Azure Pill, but the Human Sect does. Everyone knows the Human Sect is as wealthy as a prince.”

The orange cat hesitated for a long time before saying, “I’ll try. I’ll give you an answer before dusk.”

Xu Qi’an hurriedly nodded. “No rush. Tomorrow will do. The Conflict of Heaven and Man is still three days away.”

The orange cat ignored him, dashed into the flowerbed, and vanished.

*Daoist Jinlian, that old fox, always likes to fleece the younger generation. It’s worse than just freeloading…* Xu Qi’an muttered grumpily.  

The so-called Azure Pill was a miraculous elixir that purified and refines the body’s essence, strengthening bones and sinews—a description so overused that even sellers of counterfeit pills in the Jianghu disdain to employ it. Yet the Azure Pill’s effects were on a different level. It can greatly enhance the defensive capabilities of a Sixth-Rank Bronze Skin and Iron Bones.

*My Vajra body has hit a bottleneck. There’s a small remnant of Monk Shenshu’s blood left within me, but I can’t seem to absorb it—it’s just going to waste within my body...*

That was why he specifically consulted Wei Yuan. Of course, he only asked how to rapidly advance in the Vajra divine art, and Wei Yuan suggested two options: real combat and the Azure pill.

*I was troubled before, wondering how to reach the Small Accomplishment level in the Diamond Sutra. But now that Daoist Jinlian has come to me for help, I suddenly see a way…*

*Looking at it from a different angle, could it be my formidable fortune at play? I need a breakthrough; I need the Azure Pill and a life-or-death struggle, and Li Miaozhen just so happens to be in the capital for the Heaven-Man agreement.*

…

“What’s the plan?”

Emperor Yuanjing’s eyes brightened slightly as he looked towards the peerless beauty floating in the pool.

Luo Yuheng’s crimson lips parted, her voice a cool blend of allure and iciness. “Send someone to put a stop to the Conflict of Heaven and Man. They must be of the same generation and unafraid of the Heaven Sect's retaliation.”

Emperor Yuanjing frowned and pondered. “If we intervene forcibly, the Heaven Sect will undoubtedly send someone to demand an explanation. Perhaps we could interject in the form of a wager.”

Luo Yuheng nodded, then shook her head softly. “Once a wager is established, it won't end until death. The cost is too high. Your Majesty, it’s not worth sacrificing a young talent over this.”

This was essentially getting entangled in the Conflict of Heaven and Man. What was initially an agreement between Heaven Sect and Human Sect would now become a three-way pact.

The struggle between the Heaven Sect and Human Sect had its reasons, and they would abide by the rules. But to the Heaven Sect, an outsider who intervened would be nothing more than a nuisance.

Heaven Sect’s reaction would likely be one of two things: First, they would order Li Miaozhen to make quick work of them and provide some degree of “assistance” to help the matter along. Second, a senior from the sect would simply come down and swat the meddler to death.

There was no chance of retreating unscathed. If one tried to break the agreement and withdraw from the duel, not only would the objective not be achieved, but the Conflict of Heaven and Man would proceed on schedule, only delayed by a few days.

Moreover, the Daoists of the Heaven Sect would hardly allow it. In that case, they would still swat the one who broke the agreement—this time with full justification.

Emperor Yuanjing, ignoring these thoughts, moved his gaze from Luo Yuheng’s face to the direction of Sitianjian and said:

“That’s why Yang Qianhuan from Sitianjian is the ideal candidate. He does not fear Heaven Sect’s retaliation and has sufficient skill to face Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen.”

Luo Yuheng gave a slight nod. Emperor Yuanjing was right; Yang Qianhuan was indeed the best choice—no one was more suitable.

“We shall summon the Jianzheng at once,” said the emperor, waving his hand to call an elderly eunuch from outside the courtyard, instructing him to invite the Jianzheng from Sitianjian.

After two sticks of incense, the eunuch’s envoy returned to report that the Jianzheng’s response was: “Yang Qianhuan is confined beneath the Star Observation Tower. Please, Your Majesty, choose another.”

This outcome was within the expectations of both Emperor Yuanjing and Luo Yuheng, though it was still a bit disappointing.

“The Jianzheng always follows ‘rules.’ Outside of that, he has no sentiment to spare,” Emperor Yuanjing said, shaking his head with a sigh of helplessness.

What the Jianzheng was obliged to do, he did without fail. What he was not obliged to do, even the Son of Heaven could not command him.

“We’ll find another way,” the emperor said, returning to the palace.

After Emperor Yuanjing returned to the palace, he sat in the imperial study, pondering for a quarter of an hour before grabbing a brush to write a list. “Grand Eunuch, summon the individuals on this list to the palace.”

…

Under the guidance of an attendant, Nangong Qianrou crossed the plaza and entered the imperial study.

He glanced around. On the crimson carpet stood two young men clad in light armor; besides them, there was no one else present.

Nangong Qianrou recognised the two—they were both serving in the Imperial Guard. One hailed from a distinguished noble family, while the other was a commoner who had risen to prominence as a martial artist.

The two were visibly surprised upon seeing Nangong Qianrou.

Nangong Qianrou had no personal connections with them, and his withdrawn and sullen demeanor led him to silently stand aside without greeting them.

Before long, Emperor Yuanjing entered, examining the three of them as he walked, stopping finally in front of them. “Do you know why We have summoned you three to the palace?”

Nangong Qianrou remained silent. The martial artist of commoner origins lowered his head slightly, while the young man from the noble family cupped his hands. “Please, Your Majesty, instruct us.”

The emperor nodded slightly, speaking slowly, “Three days from now is the Conflict of Heaven and Man. We hope you will intervene and put a stop to it...”

He informed them of the pros and cons of the matter before asking, “Which of you is willing? Regardless of the outcome, you will be promoted by one rank.”

These three were the youngest fourth rank martial artists in the capital, and they all served the court.

Fourth rank martial artists were rare outside the capital; in the thirteen provinces of the kingdom, only a handful existed. Yet in the capital, as the centre of power within the Great Feng, the number of fourth rank experts was far greater than one would imagine.

However, there was only one third rank martial artist in the kingdom—The Zhenbei King. Third rank martial artists, capable of regenerating severed limbs, were beyond the realm of ordinary mortals; the gap between them and fourth rank was vast.

Nangong Qianrou remained expressionless.

The common-born martial artist’s eyes flashed briefly with anger, while the noble scion looked hesitant and wary.

Emperor Yuanjing said in a grave tone, “A two-rank promotion.”

The anger in the common-born guard’s eyes flared brighter, while the noble scion appeared tempted but ultimately shook his head and said in a low voice, “Forgive me, Your Majesty, your servant lacks the capability to undertake this task.”

The commoner followed suit, bowing. “Your servant, too, is unfit for the task.”

Emperor Yuanjing’s face remained calm as he nodded. “You two may withdraw. Nangong Qianrou, stay.”

The two men let out a sigh of relief and left the study.

The emperor paced back to his throne and, after several moments, spoke, “Those two—one resents us for standing up for Human Sect, fundamentally because they disapprove of our pursuit of Daoism.

“The other treasures his life, already possessing wealth and honours, and wishes not to get entangled in the sectarian disputes between the Daoist sects.”

Nangong Qianrou looked the emperor straight in the eye. “Your Majesty kept me behind because you believe I will act?”

The emperor nodded. “Nangong Qianrou, I know your identity, and I also know what you desire.”

Nangong Qianrou’s pupils contracted, then quickly returned to normal.

The emperor fixed his gaze on him. “If you handle this matter for us, I will lend you twenty thousand elite soldiers.”

Nangong Qianrou’s expression wavered, clearly tempted, but in the end, he shook his head. “Your Majesty, I gave Duke Wei my word. Until he returns my name, I won’t leave his side.

“Furthermore, neither Li Miaozhen nor Chu Yuanzhen worries me individually. But if they join forces, I am powerless. To fulfill the terms of the Conflict of Heaven and Man, they are sure to work together to eliminate any outsider first. It is not for lack of willingness, but for lack of ability.”

The emperor did not insist, merely waved his hand.

Nangong Qianrou bowed and left the study.

With a stern expression, the emperor instructed, “Inform the National Teacher that we are powerless. She must fend for herself.”

Such a stubborn woman—willing to face the Conflict of Heaven and Man, but unwilling to dual-cultivate with him. Very well then, let her face the Daoist Leader of Heaven Sect alone.

…

Lingbao Temple.

A young eunuch bowed deeply and spoke softly, "National Teacher, His Majesty is powerless as well. None of the young fourth rank experts in the capital are willing to involve themselves in the Conflict of Heaven and Man.

"You understand, His Majesty cannot force them."

Luo Yuheng did not open her eyes and replied coolly, "I understand."

The eunuch dared not linger and, after a formal salute, quickly departed.

After a quarter-hour, a slender orange cat appeared on the courtyard wall, its amber eyes staring intently at the woman floating above the pool.

"Junior Sister!"

Luo Yuheng did not look up, and her tone was tinged with suspicion, "What are you doing here?"

The orange cat hesitated, adopting a negotiating tone, "I have a question. Does the Human Sect have any Azure pill? This pill is difficult to refine and worth a fortune..."

Luo Yuheng frowned and interrupted, "If you know it's rare, why ask? And what use would an Earth Sect Daoist Leader have for an Azure Elixir?"

The orange cat seemed a bit embarrassed, "In your eyes, am I just some poor relative who only comes to take? The Azure Elixir isn't for me; I'm asking on behalf of someone else."

Luo Yuheng gave a mocking laugh, "You’re not a poor relative—you’re a shameless stinking Daoist. My father once refined a batch of Azure pill. Two were taken by Emperor Yuanjing, and I have the last one.

"But it’s difficult to make and extremely valuable. I won’t give it to you. Unless you trade me a fragment of the Earth Book."

*There's no way I'd give you the Earth Book fragment, not as if your Human Sect has any use for it…* He sighed in regret, "Forget it. I originally found someone to help you delay the Conflict of Heaven and Man. Their only condition was the Azure pill. Since you won't agree, I’ll have to turn them down."

Luo Yuheng abruptly stood, shouting: “Get back!”

Her hand reached out to yank the orange cat from the wall, throwing it to the rock garden by the pool. Her beautiful eyes were sharp and intense as she asked rapidly, "Who is this person? How confident are you? Do you understand that once you get involved in the Conflict of Heaven and Man, it's nearly impossible to withdraw?"

As she spoke, she stared intently at the orange cat, her gaze urgent.

"You’re no stranger to him. You even considered dual cultivation with him," the orange cat replied leisurely while licking its ruffled fur.

Luo Yuheng's eyes dimmed, anger flickering in them. "He’s only a rank six martial artist. Even with the Buddhist Vajra body, he barely possesses the strength of a fifth rank.

"Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen aren’t ordinary rank four experts."

The orange cat, unhurried, said, "Don't be upset. Xu Qi’an's Vajra body isn’t something an average martial artist can compare to. I even suspect that a fourth rank’s physical strength might not surpass his."

Luo Yuheng sneered, "You suspect?"

The orange cat nodded. "Because Li Miaozhen struck him with her sword at full power, and it didn’t leave a mark."

Luo Yuheng froze, finding this too outrageous to believe. She asked for confirmation, "Li Miaozhen's full-powered sword attack couldn’t harm him at all?"

The orange cat nodded again.

Luo Yuheng was utterly stunned.

…

Tower of Noble Spirit.

Wei Yuan listened to Nangong Qianrou's report, nodding with approval, "You handled it well. There’s no benefit to involving yourself in the Conflict of Heaven and Man. It's originally a dispute within the Daoist Sects, and outsiders forcing their way in are only asking for trouble."

Yang Yan murmured an agreement, "The Human Sect’s swordsmanship is unparalleled, and the Heaven Sect’s Daoist techniques are elusive. If it were one-on-one, Qianrou wouldn’t fear anyone, but facing two at once, he would surely lose."

Nangong Qianrou said indifferently, "There isn't a single rank four expert in the capital who could handle both of them simultaneously. Yang Qianhuan’s teleportation formations might ensure he remains undefeated, but once engaged in direct combat, he wouldn’t last ten moves."

Combat wasn’t an arcanist’s forte.

Wei Yuan added, "You Gold Gongs should all attend the Conflict of Heaven and Man in three days. Consider it an opportunity to broaden your horizons. High-level battles between Daoists aren’t common."

…

At dusk, Xu Qi’an heard the faint meowing of a cat. Following the sound, he found an orange cat perched on a tree branch in a secluded corner.

The orange cat held a porcelain vial in its mouth, which it gently released into Xu Qi’an’s hand.

"Plop..."

He removed the wooden stopper and brought it to his nose. An indescribable fragrance filled his senses.

"Luo Yuheng said that as long as you give it your all, whether you succeed or fail, the Azure Elixir is yours," the orange cat said.

*With this, along with the battle in three days, my Invincible Vajra Body will undoubtedly advance further. I can also prevent Number Two and Number Four from destroying each other—killing two birds with one stone...* Xu Qi’an's face lit up with joy. He sighed, "The National Teacher is truly wealthy."

*Auntie, I no longer wish to strive.*

The orange cat, gazing down at Xu Qi’an from the branch, said, "To win, you need to understand your opponents. Both Chu Yuanzhen and Li Miaozhen are experts. I think you could use some intelligence."

*That's exactly what I was thinking. I even planned to probe Li Miaozhen for information later...* Xu Qi’an said, "Daoist, please continue."

"You’re already familiar with the Human Sect’s swordsmanship, and you know about Chu Yuanzhen’s Sword Nourishing Intent, so there’s little more to add about him. The focus is on Li Miaozhen, as you know nothing about the Heaven Sect's techniques."

"Study everything until completion," Xu Qi’an noted.

"Study everything until completion... very apt," the orange cat coughed lightly before continuing, "Li Miaozhen also excels in Flying Sword techniques, which are among the supernatural abilities granted at the seventh rank, guiding qi.

“The Daoist Fifth Rank, Golden Core, can pierce through all illusions and remain unsullied by worldly corruption, so your Buddhist Lion’s Roar won’t work on Li Miaozhen."

Xu Qi’an nodded.

"Additionally, she commands lighting magicks and techniques using the five elements, but these spells require favourable timing and environment. Since the duel is set by the Wei River, watch out for water elemental spells," the orange cat warned, then added with a serious tone:

“The Heaven Sect’s core technique is the Unity of Heaven and Man. Its unique ability is to bestow spiritual awareness upon all things, creating a bond that allows them to obey. Simply put, your blade might not remain your blade, and your belt might strangle you with all its might.

“The stone at your feet might suddenly leap up and strike your knee.

"Even your hand might unexpectedly rise and slap you across the face."

*What the hell, the Heaven Sect's techniques are this insane? Is that what they mean by: ‘Loyalty is irrelevant until you meet me’? In my eyes, everything’s a traitor?*

Xu Qi’an was startled, full of envy for the Heaven Sect's bizarre techniques.

After bidding farewell to Daoist Jinlian, he returned to his room and swallowed the Azure Elixir, beginning to refine its power.

…

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. As dawn broke, Chu Yuanzhen woke, dressed himself with practiced precision, strapped on his sword, and thoughtfully covered his old school friend with a blanket.

They had drunk late into the previous night, and his friend had hinted, more than once, that Chu Yuanzhen should hold back in the upcoming Conflict of Heaven and Man.

Chu Yuanzhen knew well that, for many at court, the conflict was seen as an excellent chance to eliminate the Human Sect.

Many believed that without the Human Sect, His Majesty would attend to state affairs diligently and abandon his pursuit of the illusory goal of immortality.

*You don’t understand. I saw it clearly a decade ago. Even without the Human Sect, there would be other Daoists, another National Teacher. And even if there were none of that, Emperor Yuanjing would still seek the Dao. His desire for immortality cannot be curbed.*

Chu Yuanzhen shook his head and left the room.

Upon leaving the estate, he saw the towering figure of Hengyuan standing by the street in the dim pre-dawn light.

“Sir Xu brought me here. I will go with you,” said Hengyuan, pressing his palms together in a gesture of respect.

Chu Yuanzhen nodded in silence. As they walked side by side for a while, he glanced at the middle-aged monk. “What do you want to say?”

Hengyuan’s eyes fell on the sword strapped to Chu Yuanzhen’s back, and he spoke quietly, “I would ask you not to draw that sword.”

Chu Yuanzhen made no promises.

“It would be disrespectful to the Heaven Sect and to Li Miaozhen,” he said.

Hengyuan’s expression grew sorrowful.

...

In the palace, a contingent of Imperial Guards escorted two luxurious carriages out of the palace city, passing through the Imperial City and heading towards the outskirts.

Lin’an lifted the curtain of her carriage window. There were few people on the streets, and the breakfast vendors’ stalls emitted plumes of steam, sending tempting scents wafting into her nose.

She suddenly felt a craving to try the common folk’s morning fare.

In the carriage ahead sat Huaiqing. Lin’an was tagging along under her cover—after all, only the Crown Prince and Huaiqing had the freedom to come and go from the capital without restrictions. None of the other princes or princesses had that privilege.

Lin’an loved a good spectacle and had no intention of missing the Conflict of Heaven and Man. She had planned to have that Running Dog secretly take her out of the city, disguised as an unremarkable housewife, so she could watch the excitement by the Weishui River.

But who could have guessed the Running Dog would treat her like a ball and kick her over to Huaiqing?

Fortunately, Huaiqing was decent enough to agree to bring her along.

“Hmph, just wait and see how I deal with running dog later,” Lin’an fumed.

Though, she had no idea where he was at the moment.

...

The King Huai estate.

The estate’s guards were out in full force, escorting a luxurious carriage made of golden nanmu wood as it left the Imperial City.

...

Xu Manor.

Xu Xinnian had woken early. Leading his horse, he clip-clopped down the street until he turned a corner and saw a lavish carriage parked by the roadside.

A dozen estate guards stood vigil on either side.

The curtain of the carriage window was pulled back, revealing the charming face of Miss Wang, who smiled brightly and called out, “Sir Xu, come aboard for some tea.”

The palace exams were over, and Xu Xinnian was now a junior compiler at the Hanlin Academy—a far cry from the unranked scholar he had been.

This year’s top scholars had particularly lacked prestige, with all the attention stolen by the Conflict of Heaven and Man.

Even the common folk of the capital had shifted their focus to the Daoist feud, excited by the news that the conflict occurred only once every sixty years—a rarity in a lifetime. By contrast, the imperial exams were held every three years, making it clear which event held more weight.

Miss Wang had seized the opportunity to invite Xu Xinnian to watch the conflict with her, and this time, he didn’t refuse.

Miss Wang was overjoyed.

Once Xu Xinnian boarded, she quickly instructed her maid to pour tea and said with a smile, “I’ve heard from father that the disciples of the Heaven and Human Sects are truly remarkable experts.”

She paused, searching for a comparison. “They’re not inferior to the Gold Gongs of the Nightwatcher’s Constabulary. And I’ve also heard that the Heaven Sect’s Holy Maiden is a peerless beauty, a woman of unparalleled charm.”

Xu Xinnian nodded calmly.

His cold demeanor dampened Miss Wang’s enthusiasm. Tentatively, she asked, “Doesn’t Cijiu care about the Conflict of Heaven and Man?”

Suddenly, she called him by his courtesy name.

Xu Erlang shook his head. “I know who the Heaven Sect’s Holy Maiden is. Since her arrival in the capital, she’s been staying at my estate.”

Miss Wang was taken aback, her eyes widening. “Cijiu, don’t joke like that. How could the Heaven Sect’s Holy Maiden be at your estate? Are you old acquaintances?”

The Heaven Sect was a renowned sect in the Jianghu, far beyond the reach of a family like the Xu's—or so it seemed.
