# 441. Apprehension

*As expected, I was still too conceited, thinking I could see through the depths of the Xu family's mistress after just a short conversation...*

*Still, she’s impressive. If I hadn’t inquired about the other members of the Xu family, I too would have been fooled by her appearance...*

Wang Simu was on high alert. Well-versed in the arts of inner-court rivalry, she knew full well that true experts never bared their fangs. Those who grew arrogant under the favour of men, all but writing their domineering arrogance on their faces, had no true means to back themselves, relying solely on pleasing their husbands.

Once the favour faded, they collapsed swiftly, losing any chance of recovering their position.

The ones who knew how to disguise themselves were the true masters. And the disguise worn by the Xu family's mistress had even deceived her own sharp eyes.

By comparison, the younger daughter of the Xu family at her side fell far short of her mother.

At the very least, she had already seen from the incident at the poetry gathering that this girl was cunning and calculating.

*I'm becoming more and more curious about her. What sort of methods did she use to make the unruly Silver Gong Xu hold his tongue and obediently move out? And even after Silver Gong Xu rose to prominence, he remained loyal to this household, showing her the same respect as ever...*

Wang Simu was filled with both apprehension and intense curiosity.

Her mindset resembled Huaiqing reading military strategy, eager and insatiable to learn.

Wang Simu had come to the Xu residence today with three goals. First, to gauge the depth of Mistress Xu. Second, to assess the foundation of the Xu residence, its estate, wealth, and general furnishings.

Third, to gain a preliminary understanding of the personalities and interests of the Xu family members, to determine in the future who could be drawn in, and who needed to be suppressed.

For a woman, this was vital information. If she truly married Erlang one day, she would have to move in.

As for the depth of the mistress, she had begun to form a judgment: *unfathomable!*

Now she planned to use the opportunity to examine the foundation of the Xu household.

The two strolled through the Xu family estate, chatting casually. After the tour, Wang Simu found herself quite pleased with the residence. Even if she were to live here one day, she wouldn’t feel embarrassed.

The only issue was...

"There doesn’t seem to be many guardsa round" said Wang Simu, feigning a casual tone.

"That’s because neither Father nor my elder brothers have any trusted subordinates. So they’ve only hired a few attendants, no proper guards," Xu Lingyue explained.

Wang Simu nodded slightly. Guards responsible for protecting the household needed to be trusted, or they could easily betray the family. Besides, the male head couldn’t always be home. If the women in the house were beautiful, the danger increased.

*In that case, the defensive strength was a little lacking...* Wang Simu frowned inwardly. Though she could bring her own guards from the royal residence, doing so would both destabilise and provoke her husband’s family.

Xu Lingyue sighed. "The Xu family’s foundation is weak. There’s nothing to be done about it."

As she spoke, she subtly glanced at Miss Wang. Seeing her brows furrow ever so slightly, Xu Lingyue smiled sweetly.

At that moment, they passed by Xu Lingyue’s bedroom. Wang Simu glanced inside unintentionally, and froze. She had spotted an unexpected figure — *the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect!*

*Why is she in Xu manor? How could she be here?*

Puzzled, Wang Simu offered a graceful bow and said softly, "Greetings, Holy Maiden."

Li Miaozhen had also noticed this little lovebird of Xu Erlang’s. She nodded, replying flatly, "Miss Wang."

As the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect, Lady Flying Swallow, Li Miaozhen held herself with no small air. Such an attitude was not impolite, but rather in keeping with her identity as a chivalrous heroine of the jianghu.

Taking the opportunity, Wang Simu stepped into the room and caught sight of a woman in white quietly doing embroidery. She was stunned, this woman’s beauty was dazzling even to her.

*With Li Miaozhen too… how many stunning beauties does the Xu family have?*

Wang Simu was quietly shocked, though her expression remained calm, and she even smiled. "Is the Holy Maiden also here as a guest?"

Li Miaozhen shook her head. "No, I’ve been staying at the Xu residence for a few months."

*She had been staying here for a few months... was she a guest advisor of the Xu family?* Wang Simu suddenly realised, no wonder the Xu residence didn’t need guards. Of course it didn’t.

There was the Southern Marches girl with her staggering strength, the Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect, Li Miaozhen, the Yudao guard Baihu Xu Pingzhi, and Silver Gong Xu who had overpowered the Heaven and Human Sects alike.

Even her own royal residence didn’t boast such high-end combat power. Why would they need ordinary guards?

*Though the Xu family may be shallow in officialdom, in the jianghu, in certain aspects, its foundation is terrifyingly deep...* Wang Simu thought. As for protection, she was satisfied.

She looked toward Susu and smiled. "And this elder sister is...?"

Li Miaozhen replied calmly, "She’s Susu. My sister."

In front of outsiders, she would never say Susu was her maid.

"Good day, Miss Susu." Wang Simu greeted her warmly. "Your embroidery is so skilled, far better than mine."

Susu smiled. "I come from a humble background. Even if I marry in future, it will only be as a concubine, so I’ll inevitably have to work. Unlike Miss Wang, born into nobility, whose hands never touch spring water."

*There it is...* Xu Lingyue’s eyes lit up. All her efforts to lead Wang Simu this way had paid off.

*This Miss Susu seems quite hostile toward me, yet it’s clearly our first meeting.* Wang Simu’s pupils contracted slightly, she had a bold guess. *Was this Susu fond of Erlang?*

*She knew she couldn’t compete with me, so she brought up the matter of being a concubine. Backed by the Holy Maiden, her words were barbed though sweetly spoken...*

Wang Simu began to smile. This familiar back-and-forth felt like home territory, letting her momentarily step out from the shadow of the Xu mistress.

The young lady of the Wang family spoke gently:

"Concubines have their hardships, just as the lady of the house has her burdens. There’s no need to lament, sister. But in this world, one truth remains unchanging: the higher your position, the greater your ability must be. So in the end, being a petty person or a concubine may actually be the easiest. Don’t you agree, Sister Susu?"

Susu replied in surprise, "Is that so? I think Madam Xu seems to live quite comfortably. Her husband adores her, and her children are filial. Still, someone like Miss Wang, born into a noble family, is naturally different."

*What a backhanded compliment...* thought Miss Wang.

Li Miaozhen watched the show from the side. Susu and the Wang family’s young lady were trading polite, venom-laced remarks, both masters of inner-court rivalry. Their sharp jabs were cloaked in smiles and graceful tones.

And their composure was solid as stone. No trace of anger at all. This was clearly going to be a long match.

Li Miaozhen had never experienced this sort of thing before, so she found it fascinating. But one thing confused her: *Wang Simu was Xu Erlang’s lover. Susu was Xu Ningyan’s lover. So what are they arguing for?*

She glanced again at Xu Lingyue. The younger Xu sister wore a soft and gentle smile, appearing completely innocent, as though she didn’t understand any of the undercurrents in the room.

*The meekest lamb is always the most dangerous...* Li Miaozhen sighed to herself. Just then, faint footsteps echoed from the roof. She focused briefly.

Then rolled her eyes. Xu Ningyan had come to eavesdrop too...

*That bastard!*

Li Miaozhen’s eyes turned sly. She reckoned it was time to add a bit of fuel to the fire, couldn’t have the one up above getting too comfortable, after all. She found an opportunity to interject and said with a smile:

“Speaking of which, Sister Susu’s circumstances have always been rather bleak. Her parents passed away many years ago, and we’ve depended on each other ever since. Now that we’ve come to the capital, she’s decided not to leave.”

A glint of sharpness flashed in Wang Simu’s eyes. “Oh? She’s staying?”

*That little wretch really wants to become Xu Erlang’s concubine? But Xu Erlang clearly said there were no concubines in his household — huh, of course there aren’t, because he’s never taken one properly!*

A sudden heaviness settled in Wang Simu’s chest.

Li Miaozhen went on, “Susu and Xu Ningyan are deeply fond of each other. I’m planning to leave her at the Xu residence. We’re not aiming for the position of main wife — being a concubine would be enough.”

*Ah! A concubine to Xu Ningyan? Well, that’s no problem then.*

Wang Simu’s path cleared, like a spring breeze through a thicket. Her expression softened into a genuinely friendly smile.

*Oh, so she and Big Brother are so fond of each other…* Xu Lingyue’s gaze also turned sharp. With a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, she said:

“Sister Susu really kept this hidden well. I never realised you and my brother were such a perfect match. That’s lovely. After Miss Fuxiang passed, my brother’s been rather downcast. But now, with Sister Susu around, I imagine he’ll soon be in better spirits.”

*So she’s comparing me to a woman of the brothels, is she…* Susu glanced at Xu Lingyue.

Li Miaozhen heard the faint sound of footsteps leaving. Xu Ningyan had slipped away just as quietly as he came.

*Why on earth is the fire suddenly spreading to me? Knowing Lingyue’s temperament, she might very well sew needles into my clothes later… No, I can’t let Auntie get off scot-free. I want to see her get thoroughly thrashed. A man must stay true to his original intent…* Xu Qi’an’s face darkened, and he strode towards the inner hall.

Auntie was bent over, watering her beloved potted plants with a small bronze kettle.

“Ahem!”

Xu Qi’an gave a loud cough to draw her attention and said:

“Auntie, I just saw Lingyue taking Miss Wang off to do needlework. Honestly, that girl… our guest’s just arrived, how could she have her doing chores?”

Auntie immediately flared up. “That won’t do! Lingyue’s not much cleverer than Lingyin. She’s too honest for her own good, always thinking about housework. If she goes on like this, she’ll end up serving her mother-in-law like a maid after marriage.

“And Miss Wang is the Prime Minister’s daughter! How could we have her doing needlework? It’s infuriating!”

Just as she finished, something occurred to her. “Ningyan, we don’t seem to have any crystal-glaze glassware in the house, only the plain porcelain ones. It’s still early for lunch — could you go out and buy a few sets for me?”

She coaxed him kindly, “A few crystal-glaze glasses would make our household look more presentable. We can’t let Miss Wang look down on us.”

“Alright, alright, you’d better hurry!” Xu Qi’an hurried her along.

Auntie bustled off in quick little steps.

*Go, Auntie, go…* Watching her graceful figure retreat, Xu Qi’an broke into a smile.

Buying glassware would take ages there and back, which meant he wouldn’t be here to witness her brutal, one-sided humiliation when she stepped into this battle like a chunk of iron into a clash of kings.

Xu Qi’an thought for a moment, then took out a small jade mirror and retrieved a set of dragon-blood crystal-glaze cups from the Duke of Cao’s private collection, placing them on the table.

Then he fetched a dragon-and-phoenix porcelain jar and several blue-and-white porcelain plates, and sent them to the kitchen for the cooks to use in serving.

…

Elsewhere, Auntie made her way to her daughter’s boudoir in a flurry of brisk little steps.

Inside, the atmosphere had already grown tense — the three women were quietly locked in a battle of wits and will, like peerless martial artists locked in a standoff, unable to gain the upper hand.

“What on earth are you lot doing, needlework at a time like this?”

Auntie stepped into the room and instantly shattered the deadlock. The invisible tension of internal power between them dissipated like the tide receding.

“All you do is this sort of work. You’re now the young mistress of the Xu family, you should have the awareness to match your station, understood?” she scolded her daughter.

“Yes, Mother.” Xu Lingyue kept her head down.

Susu smiled and greeted her politely as Madam Xu, then quietly tucked away her ‘claws’ and went back to stitching the robe.

She completely subdued Lingyue and Susu the moment she walked in… Wang Simu noted it with admiration. When she was home, her mother could lecture her all she liked, and she would always talk back until her mother gave up.

But here, Xu Lingyue and Susu didn’t even dare talk back in front of the Xu family mistress — they were thoroughly subdued.

Seeing that Wang Simu wasn’t doing any needlework, Auntie let out a sigh of relief. Since she was already here, she decided to have a chat.

With a kind and friendly tone, she explained, “It’s my fault, really. I’ve always been too lazy to manage the shops and farmland, or the dividends from the Sitianjian. Lingyue takes care of all that. She’s always busy and has grown used to it.”

*Here it comes, the subtle warning… What she means is, if I ever want to manage household affairs in the future, I’ll have to get past Xu Lingyue first…* Wang Simu pondered in silence.

Once Auntie arrived, harmony returned to the room.

Xu Qi’an stood on the roof, listening to the women’s bland chatter below. He couldn’t help but feel a touch of admiration for Wang Simu.

She’d done an excellent job suppressing her nature, playing the part of a gentle, elegant young lady to perfection, trying her best to appear harmless to Auntie and the rest of the family.

*As expected of the Prime Minister’s daughter, she does have some skill.*

…

As lunchtime approached, Auntie brought Miss Wang and the womenfolk to the inner hall for the meal.

The daily fare was, in itself, a measure of the Xu family’s means, but with guests present, a more elaborate spread was only to be expected. So Wang Simu wasn’t paying attention to the food, she was looking at the porcelain.

Auntie invited Miss Wang to be seated. Wang Simu glanced at the dishes on the table, all freshly served, untouched. It was right at mealtime, and this was the main table. There were clearly men in the household, so why were the women eating first?

She tentatively asked, “I haven’t seen Silver Gong Xu?”

Auntie waved a hand casually. “He’s the only man in the house, it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to sit with you. I told him to eat in his room.”

*…Wang Simu’s heart gave a jolt. She looked closely at the Xu family mistress and thought, So, how apprehensive of her are you, Silver Gong Xu?*
