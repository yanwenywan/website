# 291. A High-Key Entry

“That’s my daughter!”

Auntie frowned, picked up Lingyin, and placed her on her lap.

"Doesn't she look like me?" Auntie asked, slightly displeased.

*How does she resemble you at all? She looks like she has nothing to do with you...* The elderly lady’s smile froze briefly, but in an instant, she regained her gentle expression and said softly:

"Looking closely, her brows and eyes really do resemble you a bit. I must have been mistaken."

Hmm, those brows and eyes do resemble that coachman outside.

The journey continued in silence.

Xu Pingzhi drove the carriage to the vicinity of the Stargazing Tower. First, he heard a noisy hubbub, and turning the corner, he saw a sea of people.

At a glance, the crowd numbered at least one or two thousand, and that was just a small part of the common people present. One could only imagine how many people radiated outward from the Stargazing Tower—it was an overwhelming number.

"This is even more lively than the Spring Festival…" Xu Pingzhi reined in the horse, stopping the carriage outside.

"Why did you stop?" came Auntie's voice from inside the carriage.

"No more road ahead, it's all people," Xu Pingzhi explained. "We’ll get off here."

Auntie lifted the carriage window and, with her husband's help, got out. Xu Lingyue also dismounted with her father’s assistance, and Little Pea was carried down by Xu Pingzhi.

The elderly lady frowned. Normally, when she got on and off a carriage, a maid would bring a small wooden stool. She was not used to this.

Luckily, the carriage was simple, and the bottom was close to the ground, unlike her luxurious golden nanmu carriage, which had a floor as high as a person's waist.

She jumped down with ease.

Xu Pingzhi waved to a nearby *Yudao* City Guard and instructed, "Watch the carriage."

While speaking, he flashed his City Guard token.

The young Yudao Guard responded respectfully.

Xu Pingzhi led his wife and children through the crowd toward a cleared passage created by the Imperial Guards. Along both sides of the passage, Imperial Guards stood, keeping the commoners at bay and forming a "safe passage" for officials and nobles.

At the entrance to the passage, two Imperial Guards crossed their spears, blocking their way.

Xu Pingzhi took out the token given to him by Xu Qi'an. After a glance, the Imperial Guards let them through.

"Ningyan’s status is getting higher and higher," Auntie said happily. "Husband dear, I never dreamed we’d one day sit with the capital's officials and nobles."

Xu Xinnian couldn't help but grumble jealously, "Mother, you’ll soon be a titled lady."

Xu Pingzhi delivered a quick verbal jab: "You should first think about how to stay in the capital."

Xu Xinnian immediately deflated.

The academy’s plan was to send him to Qingzhou, away from the capital, to make his mark.

But Xu Xinnian didn’t really want to go. Going to Qingzhou meant being far from his parents, his brother, and his sisters. If he couldn’t return to the capital after his three-year term, he’d have to serve elsewhere for another three years.

Three years after three years, he’d only be able to see his family when returning to report on his duties.

There was also another reason: if he couldn’t get into the Hanlin Academy, his path to the Cabinet was practically sealed off.

Father’s "My son has the potential to become Prime Minister" would turn into an empty boast.

After walking through the "safe passage," the family looked around and saw a large official area with many shaded pavilions. Civil officials, military officers, and nobles sat in their respective zones in an orderly yet distinct manner.

Moreover, there were many noblewomen and young ladies, most of them bringing their families to watch the contest.

For these aristocratic women, the Great Feng's reputation was secondary—being entertained was the real priority.

As Xu Pingzhi scanned the area, he led his family to the Nightwatcher Constabulary's section, where the main seat was occupied by a man with greying temples in a billowing azure robe.

Flanking him was a sea of Gold, and behind the Gold Gongs were Silver Gongs. The Bronze Gongs had been assigned to guard duty and were not qualified to watch the contest from under the pavilion.

Xu Pingzhi approached with his family, cupped his hands in a salute, and quickly led his family to their seats without drawing attention.

The famous Wei Yuan and the Gold Gongs ignored him, much to Uncle Xu’s relief. Blending in as an invisible figure was preferable.

The middle-aged lady also sighed in relief. Being a nobody was really good.

…

Among the many shaded pavilions, the most extravagant one was a large platform covered with yellow silk. Tables were arranged beneath the pavilion, where members of the royal family sat.

Even the empress, who had clashed with Consort Chen in the harem, was there. Everyone was chatting and laughing, appearing like harmonious sisters without any past discord.

The four princesses were present, with Huaiqing sitting at the head, and Lin’an by her side.

As for the princes, the crown prince was still confined and couldn’t attend, but the others were all present.

This magical duel, to the royal family, was not only an entertaining spectacle but also concerned the court’s reputation and their own honour.

"Where is Xu Qi'an? Why hasn’t he come out yet? Can he beat those bald monks? How are the monks going to compete in the contest…"

Lin’an chattered nonstop, her sparkling peach-blossom eyes darting around. Not seeing her lackey, she deflated.

"No chance!" The seventh prince shook his head. "That Xu Qi'an is just a martial artist. How can he contend with the Buddhist monks? Besides, with his meagre cultivation, can he really cope?"

The third prince chuckled in agreement: "Unless they compete in poetry."

The two princesses and the other princes couldn’t help but laugh.

Lin’an, furious, glared at her brothers and sisters and snapped, "Are you so happy if he loses? Should We order a Buddha statue for each of you?"

The third princess frowned, "We were just talking. What’s the matter with you, Lin’an?"

The other princes all frowned.

Ever since the Fu Consort case, Lin’an had grown more irritable and had become increasingly rude to her siblings, speaking sharply.

Huaiqing said calmly, “If it were a Daoist contest, the strongest would naturally win. The same applies to other systems. But Buddhism is different. Buddhism values enlightenment, a pure heart, and Zen wisdom.

"Xu Qi'an may only be a seventh-grade martial artist, and there are many who surpass him in cultivation. But what good is higher cultivation? Can anyone's cultivation be higher than that of Arhat Du’e?"

Huaiqing’s words always left people speechless, unable to refute.

The princes and princesses fell silent.

…

The canopy adjacent to the royal pavilion was where Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen sat, sipping his wine. He noticed that his daughter's gaze kept wandering toward the area where the Nightwatchers were seated.

Frowning, he asked, "Mu’er, what are you looking at?"

Miss Wang withdrew her gaze and replied with a faint smile, "It’s my first time seeing the famous Duke Wei in person. His bearing is indeed extraordinary."

After speaking, she glanced out of the corner of her eye at a certain exceptionally handsome young man.

"By the way, why haven’t I seen His Majesty?" she asked nonchalantly, diverting her father's attention.

Prime Minister Wang glanced over at the royal pavilion and chuckled, "With the two women in the palace at each other’s throats, His Majesty finds it bothersome and didn’t want to come down. He’s likely observing everything from the Bagua Platform."

Miss Wang responded with a light "Oh," then continued, "Father, what is the reason for the Western Region delegation’s visit to the capital this time? Their sudden challenge to a duel seems rather perplexing."

An emissary group doesn’t just arrive without reason; there must be a purpose behind it. The intense atmosphere surrounding the Buddhist sect these days made it clear that the delegation's visit was far from friendly.

"It might be related to the Sangpo case," Wang Zhenwen remarked casually.

Miss Wang furrowed her brow, extracting two pieces of information from her father's response. First, even as the prime minister, he wasn’t fully aware of the situation. Second, the Sangpo case likely concealed deeper secrets.

Just as she was about to probe further, Wang Zhenwen waved his hand impatiently. "You’re just a young lady—don’t concern yourself with matters of the court. All those clever little tricks of yours will be better put to use on your future husband."

Miss Wang pouted her lips, but said no more. Sexing the moment while her father wasn’t paying attention, she shifted her gaze back toward the Nightwatchers.

*When this duel is over, I'll host a literary gathering at the manor...* she thought to herself.

On the other side, Xu Pingzhi, drawing on his years of experience working in the capital, scanned the various canopies, identifying prominent figures he recognised. Of course, there were far more he didn’t recognise.

Still, he noted that the closer to the royal pavilion one was seated, the higher the person's status.

Suddenly, he had a sense of standing on the stage of imperial power in the capital, and it was all thanks to Ning Yan… After this duel, if Ning Yan emerges victorious, he will become famous in the capital, renowned throughout the Great Feng... But if he loses, he will be ridiculed for a long time. And should the event be recorded in history, he might bear the scorn of future generations.

Thinking of this, Uncle Xu felt a complex mix of emotions.

"Dear, is that princess over there the one who came to offer prayers for Ning Yan that day?" Auntie asked, recognising the serene and radiant Princess Huaiqing from the crowd.

Xu Pingzhi gave a small grunt in acknowledgment.

Auntie continued, "The princess next to her, wearing the red dress, is quite pretty too, though... her gaze seems rather flirtatious. She doesn’t look very proper."

Xu Pingzhi was startled and hastily whispered, "Stop talking nonsense. Don’t speak ill of the princess in public like this—do you want our entire family executed?"

Auntie quickly shut her mouth.

"What’s so unspeakable about it? There’s not a single decent person in the royal family of the Great Feng," the older lady said indifferently.

*We don’t even know you. Go mind your own business...* Xu Xinnian thought inwardly.

Xu Pingzhi let out a long breath, forcing himself to ignore the woman, and instructed his family, "In occasions like this, it's best to look, listen, and say little. Do nothing, and nothing will go wrong… Lingyin!?"

The two words "Lingyin" came out in a high-pitched tone.

At some point, Xu Lingyin had toddled over to the azure-robed eunuch. She stood there, looking up at him with wide eyes, pointing at the food on the table, and asked with innocent anticipation, "Uncle, can I eat your food?"

Seeing this, Xu Pingzhi felt a numbness shoot up his spine from his tailbone all the way to the top of his head.

The Gold Gongs around Duke Wei furrowed their brows simultaneously, wondering where this child had come from with so little sense of propriety.

Zhang Kaitai, who had attended the memorial for Xu Qi’an, recognised the little girl and quickly explained, "Duke Wei, this is Xu Ningyan's youngest sister."

The Gold Gongs' expressions softened as they sized up Xu Lingyin, thinking that this child, unafraid of strangers and with such boldness, would surely achieve great things one day.

Wei Yuan picked up a piece of candied fruit and handed it to her.

Xu Lingyin took it and gobbled it up in a few bites.

"That’s not how you eat candied fruit. The longer you keep it in your mouth, the longer the sweetness lasts," Wei Yuan said with a smile.

"If I wait too long, all the sweets will be eaten by someone else," Xu Lingyin frowned. "If I just keep eating, it will always be sweet… Uncle, I want more."

Wei Yuan chuckled and gave her a few more pieces of candied fruit. After eating for a while, Xu Lingyin shyly asked, "Uncle, why aren’t you eating?"

Wei Yuan shook his head, smiling.

"You’re not eating because you don’t want to," Xu Lingyin blinked her clear, innocent eyes and cautiously tested, "If you’re not eating, I’ll finish all of them."

"You think you can eat all of them?" Wei Yuan laughed, glancing at Xu Lingyin’s small belly and then at the table filled with fruits, candies, and exquisite pastries.

"Duke... Duke Wei…"

Xu Pingzhi nervously approached, bowing low and trying to steady his trembling voice. "My daughter is mischievous. Please don’t take offense."

Wei Yuan raised his sleeve and handed a yellow pear to Xu Lingyin.

Jiang Lyuzhong, observing the scene, smiled and said, "Lord Wei is just chatting with the child. You can go back now."

Xu Pingzhi glanced at Little Pea, then at Wei Yuan, who paid him no mind. Left with no choice, he turned and walked away.

"Father, why are you so worried? Big Brother is a Silver Gong, well-regarded by Lord Wei. Lingyin won’t get into trouble," Xu Erlang reassured.

Xu Pingzhi sighed.

Young people didn’t understand how terrifying Wei Yuan is. Anyone who lived through the Battle of Shanhai Pass knew that Wei Yuan was far from the amiable person he appears to be.

Time passed slowly. The food in front of Wei Yuan dwindled as he glanced at Xu Lingyin’s small belly. He frowned and placed his hand on her head, then pressed various parts of her body for a while.

"What a shame," Wei Yuan said regretfully.

"Father, what’s wrong?" Yang Yan asked.

"This child’s bones are strong, and her natural foundation is excellent, but her tendons and ligaments are too inflexible. She’s not suitable for martial arts training," Wei Yuan sighed.

"No wonder she eats so much. Is this girl a bottomless pit?" Nangong Qianrou teased.

"Ptui ptui ptui…" Xu Lingyin spat at him, her little eyebrows shooting up. "You’re a bad person."

She still remembered this pretty sister, the one who tricked her family into thinking her big brother was dead, making her parents cry for so long.

Nangong Qianrou snorted, pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the spit off her trousers.

Before they knew it, the time had come. Master Du’e, who had been meditating cross-legged under the pavilion, opened his eyes and said in a resonant voice, "Jianzheng, do you know of the Sumeru Mustard Seed?"

"A mere parlour trick!"

A mocking laugh echoed from above the heavens.

In that moment, whether among the dignitaries or the commoners outside, everyone’s spirits soared with excitement.

The main event had begun!

Master Du’e drew a golden alms bowl from his sleeve and gently tossed it forward.

Boom!

The bowl, heavy as a thousand pounds, crashed into the stone floor, cracking it deeply and embedding itself in the ground.

A pure golden light shot up from the bowl, and in the sky above, a towering mountain appeared. Winding stone steps led deep into a forest, with a temple faintly visible at the mountain’s peak.

"A divine technique..." Auntie was dumbfounded, her eyes wide and mouth agape.

Except for the martial artists who had cultivation, none of the ordinary people who witnessed this scene could manage their expressions, and the crowd erupted in amazement.

"Father, what is the Sumeru Mustard Seed?" Nangong Qianrou furrowed her brows.

"This is a Buddhist parable." Wei Yuan glanced at Xu Lingyin, who was oblivious to everything around her, and said indifferently:

"Mount Sumeru hides mustard seeds, while a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru. It is said that Buddha had a mountain called *Sumeru*, which was his domain. Wherever he went, the domain followed."

Yang Yan recalled the Battle of Shanhai Pass twenty years ago, and the scene of Buddhist monks transporting armies. He suddenly understood: "A Buddhist realm within the palm of one’s hand?"

Wei Yuan nodded. "Within the golden bowl, there indeed hides a mountain."

"Jingsi, enter the mountain and guard the second pass," Master Du'e ordered.

The handsome monk dressed in azure stood up, pressed his palms together in a gesture of respect, and then, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, stepped into the golden bowl.

The next moment, on the vast scroll unfurled in the sky, a young monk appeared, climbing the mountain.

He climbed the steps at a steady pace, reaching the mountainside where he sat cross-legged.

Golden light descended from the sky, converging on him. In an instant, his body was covered in a radiant golden glow, as though he had been cast in gold.

...

"So this world really has the Sumeru Mustard Seed," Xu Qi'an was speechless.

Yang Qianhuan, with his back to Xu Qi'an, nodded. "the Sumeru Mustard Seed, also known as a Buddhist realm in one palm. However, this should be an ownerless world, hidden within the golden bowl."

"If it were a realm with an owner, then victory or defeat would be decided by its owner's will, how would that be fair."

Chu Caiwei stuffed a bag of pastries into Xu Qi'an's arms and said sweetly, "Xu Ningyan, take these and eat them on your way up the mountain."

"...Thanks, but I'm not hungry." Xu Qi'an politely declined.

Behind him, a group of white-robed arcanists cheered him on: "Go, Young Master Xu! Though we don't know why Jianzheng chose you, the teacher must have his reasons."

"You must return triumphant, Young Master Xu!"

*We'll see if I return triumphant... but for now, let me show off in front of the whole capital...* Xu Qi'an patted Yang Qianhuan on the shoulder and said:

"Senior Brother Yang, after today, you will understand what it means to perform be a saint amongst men!"

...

Outside the arena, on the rooftop of a tavern, swordsman Chu Yuanzhen and the burly bald-headed Hengyuan stood side by side, gazing at the radiant young monk Jingsi. The top scholar smacked his lips and said:

"A Gold-cast body... This Sumeru world has enhanced Jingsi's Vajra Body. With Xu Ningyan's current strength, it would be impossible to break it."

Hengyuan felt conflicted. As a Buddhist disciple, he should have stood with the Buddhists. But at the same time, he was a citizen of the Great Feng, and it was Sir Xu the Benevolent who was fighting.

"What happened last night? Why didn’t you receive my message?" Chu Yuanzhen asked.

"Daoist Jinlian blocked it," Hengyuan replied.

Earlier this morning, Chu Yuanzhen had come to watch the 'show' with Hengyuan and also inquired about last night's missed messages. After comparing notes, they both concluded that Daoist Jinlian had blocked Number Four's message.

"I knew it was Daoist Jinlian who blocked it, but why?" Chu Yuanzhen said, puzzled.

"Daoist Jinlian didn’t want you to reveal that Xu Qi'an was representing Sitianjian in the duel?"

"Hmph, do you think that makes sense?" Chu Yuanzhen sneered.

"It doesn't," Hengyuan shook his head.

"I have a feeling there's more to this." Chu Yuanzhen pondered, but he didn't dwell on the matter and instead asked:

"You stayed at Sanyang Station for three days. Did you gain anything?"

"The Diamond Sutra can't be passed down easily. Uncle Du'e told me that if I wanted to view the Diamond Sutra, I could return to the Western Regions with him and practice at Mount Sumeru for three years," Hengyuan said.

"So you could fully become a Buddhist and sever all ties with the Great Feng?" Chu Yuanzhen smirked.

"Not exactly," Hengyuan defended. "The Diamond Sutra isn't something just anyone can cultivate. Aren't you curious why it's Jingsi who came to fight, and not someone else?"

Chu Yuanzhen's mind stirred. "Is Jingsi the only one in the Western Regions delegation who mastered the Diamond Sutra?"

Hengyuan nodded. "Either one is born with a Buddha-nature, able to comprehend its profound meaning, or one must go to Mount Sumeru to listen to Buddhist teachings for a chance to understand the Diamond Sutra."

Suddenly, Chu Yuanzhen clapped his hands and exclaimed with frustration, “So even if Xu Qi'an wins this duel and obtains the Diamond Sutra, it would be useless?

"Because a lustful person like Xu Qi'an could never possess any Buddha-nature."

Hengyuan was silent for a moment, then slowly nodded.

As they talked, they heard Master Du'e announce loudly, “This contest will be a mountain climb! If one reaches the top, enters the temple, and still does not convert to our Buddhist faith, then we shall admit defeat. The Sitianjian has three attempts.”

Hearing this, Wei Yuan smiled.

"A mountain climb..." Yang Yan murmured. "The path will undoubtedly be fraught with challenges. One wrong step, and it will be an instant defeat."

After Master Du'e finished speaking, he closed his mouth and meditated silently.

Both inside and outside the arena, the audience waited for a long time, yet Sitianjian still did not send anyone to compete. For a time, rumours and discussions broke out.

"Why hasn't Sitianjian acted? Are they afraid?"

"Where is the Jianzheng? Say something, Jianzheng!"

"What’s going on? If Sitianjian was scared, why did they agree to this duel in the first place? Do they want to embarrass the Great Feng even more?"

Suddenly, someone exclaimed excitedly, "Look! Someone's coming out of the Stargazing Tower!"

In an instant, countless heads turned, and all eyes were on the gate of the Stargazing Tower.

From the hall on the first floor, a cloaked figure slowly walked out, holding a wine jar and wearing a hood, head lowered, face obscured.

The moment the cloaked figure stepped down the stairs, a deep chant echoed across the arena, carried by a surge of energy that reached everyone's ears.

“*At fifteen and twenty, a sword in hand, I wandered the Jianghu far.*”

As the cloaked figure took his second step, the deep voice suddenly grew impassioned: 

“*One day I soared, the wind rose high, like a roc nine-thousand li.*”

*This...* In the pavilions, one after another, civil officials instinctively stood up, and paid their respects to the figure.

On the third step, the cloaked figure pointed to the heavens, his voice turning from passionate to majestic: 

“*Where the seas end the heavens make shore, I stand atop the warrior’s peak!*”

Inside and outside the arena, the eyebrows of many martial artists shot up, their expressions odd. Some among the Jianghu crowd outside even stirred their energy in response.

On the fourth step, the cloaked figure let out a long howl: 

“*I fought across three thousand miles, one blade against a million men.*”

Wei Yuan raised an eyebrow, leaning slightly forward.

The generals all rose abruptly to their feet.

On the fifth step, the figure let out a soft sigh: 

“*If the heavens birthed not Xu Ningyan, then all Jiuzhou will be night that never ends!”

Xu Xinnian was fucking furious.

This was the greatest poem he had ever written, born from the depths of despair.

*How shameless, big brother!*

He glanced around and saw the stunned faces all around him. They were all gazing intently at the cloaked figure, utterly captivated.

*When I recited this poem, my family mocked me, but when my brother does it, he is admired by the masses, respected by everyone...* Xu Xinnian fumed.

In his anger, he looked to the woman beside him. She was staring at the cloaked figure, entranced.

Princess Huaiqing was gazing at the cloaked figure, her eyes radiating light. For the first time, she thought how captivating this man was.

Xu Qi'an said no more, carrying his wine jar as he slowly entered the arena, finally stopping beside the golden bowl. Then, he removed his hood and drank deeply.

The wine flowed down his chin, soaking his clothes. It was wild and carefree.

Suddenly, he smashed the wine jar to the ground, laughing heartily as shards scattered.

“*Today heroes emerge from our ranks, spending years roaming the Jianghu deep. Chatting and scheming about grand ambition, yet nothing beats a drunken feast!*”

Amid his wild, arrogant laughter, he leapt into the golden bowl.

At that moment, the entire arena fell silent.

After a long while, a sudden, overwhelming wave of cheers and clamour washed over the audience.

“The Great Feng will win!”

“The Great Feng will win!”

Such a high-key entry, line after line of poetry to be remembered throughout the ages, in an instant beat down the grandeur of the Buddhist sect, looking down on them from high above.

And restoring faith to the common people.

The civil and military officials slowly nodded their heads, showing expressions of praise and admiration. Such an act by Xu Qi’an had much deeper goals.

To rouse the spirits, and raise the banners.
