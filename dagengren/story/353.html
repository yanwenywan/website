# 353X. The Princess Consort's Secret

*Run Does he mean that the four of us, all fourth rank, have no chance of victory against this kid?* The hot-headed and bloodthirsty Zalmukha was not swayed. He narrowed his eyes, locking onto Xu Qi’an.

*What… what did he see? Why would he tell us to run?* Tangshan-Jun, ever suspicious, stared at Xu Qi’an with heightened vigilance. If this boy were truly so terrifying, why had he been entangled in combat for so long just moments before?

*The Qi-watching technique showed something that isn’t meant to be seen?* The contempt on Tianlang’s face vanished as he readied himself, as if about to face a great adversary.

*Something is wrong with this boy…* Hongling glanced at the White-Robed Arcanist’s miserable state, and a memory flickered in her mind, sharp as a dagger. It was from a conversation she once had with the arcanist while journeying to ambush the Zhenbei Consort.

Back then, she had heard that the princess consort’s beauty was so resplendent, that an Arcanist could see her Qi from tens of miles away.

In a moment of curiosity, she had asked, “What would happen if a third-ranked, second-ranked, or even first-ranked cultivator were viewed through Qi-watching?”

The arcanist had answered her solemnly, “A third rank would severely damage the observer’s soul. A second rank would leave the observer blind and insane on the spot. As for a first rank…”

He hadn’t continued, but Hongling had gleaned enough from his grave expression—the result would undoubtedly be death.

*Second rank? Could this boy be second rank? No, it’s not him. It's something on him, something tied to the power of a second rank…* Her heartbeat quickened uncontrollably, adrenaline surging and goosebumps erupting as her body was overwhelmed with the urge to flee.

Xu Qi’an raised his hand gently, making to press down. with that simple gesture, a breeze-like wave of Qi swept through, and every maidservant in the area collapsed, unconscious.

*Run, run now, or I’ll die…!* The enormous fear detonated in her heart. Hongling forced herself to suppress her instincts and plastered on a forced smile. “What arrogance! Zalmukha, aren’t you going to act? Or have you lost interest in the Confucian tome?”

Zalmukha, ever eager for battle and already unconvinced by Xu Qi’an’s supposed threat, gave a savage grin. He charged forward, the earth trembling under his enormous strides.

Tangshan-Jun and Tianlang were about to join him when they noticed Hongling darting away, abandoning them all.

*What?!* The two fourth-ranked experts exchanged glances, their pupils contracting with realisation. A dreadful premonition gripped them.

Then came the scream. Zalmukha’s bloody scream.

Whipping their heads back, they saw the towering giant on his knees, writhing in agony. His enormous wrist was trapped in a grotesquely blackened hand—muscular, veiny, and disproportionate, exuding a horrifyingly abyssal aura. Merely looking at it made their heads swim with vertigo.

Now they understood why Hongling had fled and why the White-Robed Arcanist had screamed for them to escape.

Crack! Crack! The sound of shattering bones rang out. Zalmukha’s enormous frame shrivelled rapidly, his anguished cries silenced.

The remaining two wasted no time. One leapt onto the feathered spider, while the other sprinted after Hongling, their retreat nothing short of frantic.

“Freedom from fear, freedom from delusion,” Xu Qi’an intoned with a resonant voice.

Buddhist commandments!

This time, he didn’t need the magic book. The force controlling his body was Shenshu.

In an instant, the command took hold. Hongling, Tangshan-Jun, and Tianlang found their panic quelled, their desire to flee snuffed out. Instead, an uncontrollable urge to fight overtook them.

When the edict’s grip released two seconds later, the fear and desperation returned—but it was too late.

In two seconds, a Shenshu-possessed Xu Qi’an completed a devastating triple kill.

He drew the black-gold blade from his back and hurled it. Without watching it fly, he vanished like a ghost, reappearing in front of Tianlang. Grasping the man’s neck, he unleashed a burst of Qi.

Crack! His head was picked off its shoulders.

Leaping high into the air, Xu Qi’an descended with a thunderous kick, driving Tangshan-Jun into the ground before slamming his palm atop the man’s head.

Bang! Tangshan-Jun’s eyes rolled back as his reptilian pupils faded to black.

Farther away, a faint “thunk” echoed as the black-gold blade pierced Hongling’s chest, nailing her to the ground. Her vaunted fourth-rank physique proved as fragile as paper under Shenshu’s immense power.

“No, no, don’t kill me… please…” Hongling gasped, blood frothing at her lips. She looked pitiable, trembling in the face of death.

Regret surged through her. If only she hadn’t joined this ambush. If only she hadn’t come to the Great Feng. She would never have encountered this monster—a demon in the guise of a Silver Gong.

Too late. She understood now, but too late.

“This monk does not kill. This monk is merely ushering your soul into the cycle of reincarnation,” Shenshu said with serene benevolence, turning to the false consort whose bloodless corpse now lay shrivelled. “Just like her.”

Hongling let out a final despairing scream, “Who… who are you?”

“Silver Gong of the Great Feng, Xu Qi’an,” Shenshu replied.

*Xu Qi’an…* The name echoed in her mind, the last thought she ever had.

With his adversaries slain, Shenshu methodically drained their essence, leaving them as withered husks.

“Next time you face such foes, remember to call me...” Shenshu returned control of the body to Xu Qi’an.

*Shenshu boasts now? How dull. I didn’t even get to truly experience the power of a fourth rank. They fell without a proper fight…* Xu Qi’an sighed internally.

The outcome didn’t surprise him. In fact, he expected nothing less. After all, Shenshu, even a mere severed arm, had once fought off four Gold Gongs and Yang Qianhuan. Now, nourished for half a year and further strengthened by the ancient tomb’s fortune, it was only natural that fourth-rank enemies would fall with ease.

*But could he match the Zhenbei King? A third rank… The gulf between third and fourth rank is vast, like heaven and earth. While Shenshu can easily kill fourth ranks, third rank might be beyond him…* Xu Qi’an mused, gripping his blade tightly. Around him, only maidservants and two survivors remained: Chu Xianglong and the White-Robed Arcanist.

“You’re about to die. Any parting words?” Xu Qi’an asked, standing over Chu Xianglong.

“Who… who are you?” Chu Xianglong rasped, his gaze clouded as he looked at the Silver Gong. His heart had been pierced by an arrow—only his formidable martial physique kept him alive.

“Didn’t I already say? Silver Gong of the Great Feng, Xu Qi’an.”

“That’s… not your voice…”

Xu Qi’an didn’t answer.

After a moment’s silence, Chu Xianglong mustered his remaining strength to ask, “I’ve always wondered… The stone Buddha you gave me…”

“It was fake. A cobbled-together piece, incomplete and lacking in weight,” Xu Qi’an sneered.

“…you deserve a wretched death!” Chu Xianglong cursed.

Thunk! 

The black-gold blade descended, severing his head.

Then, he turned his gaze to the arcanist, whose mind had descended into madness. The man was beyond communication, blood streaming from his eyes as he murmured repeatedly, "Run... run..."

With a swift motion, Xu Qi’an raised his blade and ended the arcanist’s life.

After eliminating all witnesses, Xu Qi’an retrieved the Confucian book, tore out the record of the Daoist "Yin-Gathering Formation," and ignited it with a burst of qi.

In the dense forest, a chilling wind swept through, and the sunlight seemed to lose its warmth.

Seven faint, unreal shadows materialised in midair, their expressions dull and lifeless.

Before heading north, Li Miaozhen had told Xu Qi’an that when a person dies, the heavenly and earthly souls leave the body, but the human soul lingers for seven days before dissipating. Until all three souls are united, the spirit remains dull and unresponsive.

No matter the question, they would answer truthfully and could not lie.

"How did you learn of the princess consort’s journey north and prepare the ambush in advance?" Xu Qi’an scanned the souls of the four northern experts and asked calmly.

"Xu Shengzu told us," replied the towering Zalmukha, his face vacant.

"And who is Xu Shengzu?" Xu Qi’an pressed.

"An arcanist…" Zalmukha answered with unwavering honesty.

*An arcanist?* Xu Qi’an's gaze shifted immediately to the soul of the white-clad arcanist, his thoughts churning. He continued, "Why ambush the princess consort?"

When dealing with souls, Xu Qi’an knew questions had to be asked one at a time. Overloading them would result in no answer.

"To prevent the Zhenbei King from reaching second rank," Zalmukha replied.

*To prevent the Zhenbei King from reaching second rank? What connection could there be between the princess consort’s death and the Zhenbei King’s advancement? Without her, would he truly be unable to achieve second rank?*

This revelation completely upended Xu Qi’an's expectations, leaving him pondering deeply.

Initially, Xu Qi’an had speculated that the princess consort’s journey north concealed some secret, perhaps tied to Emperor Yuanjing or a scheme involving the Zhenbei King.

Indeed, there was a hidden agenda—but never would he have imagined that a mere woman could be crucial to the Zhenbei King’s advancement to second rank.

After a long period of reflection, Xu Qi’an asked the same question to Hong Ling, Tangshan-Jun, and Tianlang. Their answers were consistent.

Their sole purpose in ambushing the princess consort was to prevent the Zhenbei King from advancing to second rank. Xu Qi’an then asked, "What is so special about the princess consort?"

Zalmukha murmured, "It’s said that the princess consort possesses an exceptionally rare spiritual essence. Absorbing it would make advancing to third rank effortless."

*This…* Xu Qi’an's pupils slightly contracted. He found the claim hard to believe.

If fourth rank warriors are still considered human, then third rank warriors transcend mortal limits—a qualitative leap in life itself.

Thus, the number of third ranks compared to fourth ranks fell off a cliff. Xu Qi’an had no idea how many fourth rank warriors the Great Feng had, but it was certainly many.

Yet in third rank was only the Zhenbei King. The difficulty of such advancement was evident.

*Could a mere princess consort enable a fourth rank warrior to advance to third rank?*

At this thought, Xu Qi’an couldn't help but glance at the old auntie.

*No wonder she had seemed so distraught after learning about the ambush on the official ship—so unlike her usual proud demeanour. She must have known her unique nature and the fate that awaited her if she fell into the hands of the barbarians.*

Then another discrepancy struck him.

"Wait… if the princess consort is truly so coveted, how has she survived all these years unscathed? The allure of advancing to third rank would be irresistible, not just to the northern barbarians but to fourth rank experts in the Great Feng as well, like Yang Yan."

*Yang Yan, that martial arts fanatic, would surely go mad for such an opportunity… Yet when I questioned him on the official ship, he clearly had no knowledge of the princess consort’s peculiarities… Hmm, if I were the Zhenbei King or Emperor Yuanjing, I would certainly keep her secret. But how did the northern barbarians find out?*

Xu Qi’an voiced this doubt.

Zalmukha answered truthfully, "Xu Shengzu told us."

*Again, an arcanist…* Xu Qi’an turned the same question to Tangshan-Jun and the Tianlang. Their answers matched Zalmukha's. They were certain the princess consort harbored a spiritual essence capable of helping them advance to third rank.

When it came to Hong Ling, however, Xu Qi’an expanded on his question.

The seductive woman, her eyes vacant, spoke in a low voice, "My lord has long coveted the princess consort. He ordered me to intercept her. Out of jealousy, I asked what was special about her. He said she harboured a spiritual essence and recited a poem."

*…My lord? Chu Xianglong claimed she was the favored concubine of the Qingyan Tribe’s leader. That lord must be the tribe’s leader?* Xu Qi’an dismissed the thought quickly and asked, "What poem?"

The seductive woman instinctively showed a trace of jealousy and said, “A flower blooming makes all fragrance bland, beauty overflowing under the morning sun. Praised by all as the finest of the realm, entrancing the commonfolk and heaven’s son.”

*This was the same poem Fuxiang had recited to me. It was said that the abbott of a temple had been so taken with the princess consort's beauty in her youth that he composed this poem for her…*

*This poem is certainly genuine, as it is widely known. Or could there be a deeper meaning behind it that most people are unaware of? When I return to the capital, I’ll ask Dean Zhao Shou about it.*

For now, most of the mysteries had been resolved.

The Zhenbei King sought to advance to second rank and required the princess consort's spiritual essence to overcome his final barrier. Emperor Yuanjing and Chu Xianglong were guarding against their enemies within the Great Feng, those who did not wish for the Zhenbei King to reach second rank.

However, due to Xu Shengzu and the mysterious arcanist behind him, the barbarians learned of the matter and set their ambush to seize the princess consort.

This had resulted in the current disparity between the attackers and the escort force.

*So, the court's internal enemies had yet to make their move?*

*No, they already had…* Xu Qi’an's eyes suddenly brightened as certain details came to mind.

Former Assistant Minister of Revenue Zhou Xianping orchestrated the tax silver case, which had involved a mysterious arcanist. That case proved to Xu Qi’an that this mysterious arcanist controlled certain factions within the court.

Zhou Xianping was the evidence.

*How did the barbarians learn of the princess consort's unique nature? It was this arcanist Xu Shengzu, who told them.*

The traitors within the court were surely colluding with the northern barbarians. They shared a common link: the mysterious arcanist.

*Sons of bitches, why are arcanists all fucking LYBs. The Jianzheng is scheming in secret, and so is this mysterious arcanist. One is more devious than the other. Wait—there’s no way the Jianzheng doesn’t know about this mysterious arcanist…*

*Xu Qi’an’s expression froze as a startling thought flashed through his mind: Is the Jianzheng playing a game of wits against this mysterious arcanist?!*

*Everyone is a pawn in their game, myself included—even Shenshu…*

Xu Qi’an exhaled slowly, deciding to set aside the matter of the Jianzheng and the mysterious arcanist for now. That was a challenge for the future, beyond what he could influence at present.

Pawns had their advantages: they could grow through the gifts of their players. When he was strong enough, he would overturn the game board.

But before that, he needed to lie low and cultivate from other sources. Relying solely on the players’ gifts would never allow him to develop enough strength to upend the game.

Shifting his focus, Xu Qi’an asked about the primary goal of the barbarians’ operation: "Was the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles massacre your barbarians’ doing?"
