# 380. Rage!

The aged face of Minister Sun turned ashen with despair. He looked deeply at the Prime Minister, his voice trembling with anguish: "Chuzhou City... is no more..."

*Boom!*

A thunderclap seemed to strike the Prime Minister’s head.

The High Court Minister added sorrowfully, "The Zhenbei King is dead..."

*Boom! Boom!*

Two more thunderclaps crashed upon the Prime Minister’s head, leaving him dumbfounded.

Another fourth-rank official angrily exclaimed, "The Zhenbei King massacred the entire city..."

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

The Prime Minister felt as though bolt after bolt of thunder was hammering his skull, rendering his thoughts blank. He couldn’t manage his expressions, his mind in complete disarray.

To Minister Sun and the others, the Prime Minister sat lifelessly behind his desk, his eyes unfocused, his expression wooden—like a lifeless paper effigy.

*Chuzhou City is gone?*  

*The Zhenbei King is dead?*  

*And Chuzhou City was destroyed by the Zhenbei King?*

*Why am I the last to hear about such crucial news?*

After a long pause, the Prime Minister’s mind rebooted from its frozen state, and questions began to form on their own.

A veteran of the court, the Prime Minister took a deep breath. His gaze, both heavy and sharp, landed on Minister Sun. "Tell me everything, Minister Sun. Begin from the start."

Minister Sun nodded but remained silent. Instead, he turned towards the study’s entrance and called out, "Constable Chen!"

Constable Chen stepped over the threshold and into the study.

Minister Sun sighed deeply. "It’s better for those involved to explain themselves."

The High Court Minister, hearing this, shook his head with a faint smile. "You and I thought of the same solution."

He immediately left the study and ordered the servants of the manor to summon the High Court Deputy waiting outside.

When the High Court Deputy entered the study, Constable Chen noticed the Prime Minister’s gaze on him. Bowing slightly, he saluted the gathered officials and said, "Prime Minister Sir, esteemed gentlemen, the journey north was far from smooth. In Jiangzhou’s territory, we encountered an ambush by three fourth-rank experts from the barbarian clans. At the time, the delegation only had one fourth rank: Gold Gong Yang."

The Prime Minister looked shocked as he scrutinised Constable Chen. "How did you escape the ambush?"

Constable Chen replied, "To be frank, the delegation nearly met its demise aboard the government ship. It was Silver Gong Xu who suddenly gathered us and proposed we switch to travelling by land. He claimed that if we didn’t, we’d likely face an ambush at Flowstone Shoals the next day. After some heated debate, we chose to heed Silver Gong Xu’s advice.

"The following day, Gold Gong Yang set out alone by ship to probe the waters and indeed encountered an ambush. The culprit was Tangshan-Jun of the Dragon Tribe from the northern Yao clans."

The Prime Minister nodded faintly. "His mind is meticulous, his instincts sharp as a cunning rabbit’s. When I chose him as the primary officer for the delegation, the majority of the court actually acknowledged his capability."

"Still, we could not evade pursuit. Eventually, they tracked us down. At that time, three fourth-rank experts surrounded the delegation, and Gold Gong Yang could barely hold the line." Constable Chen’s expression turned solemn as he continued, "In the critical moment, Silver Gong Xu stood forward, single-handedly holding off two fourth-rank experts, buying us the time we needed to escape. It was after this incident that we parted ways with him. It wasn’t until Chuzhou City fell that we met him again…"

Prime Minister Wang raised a hand, interrupting him. "What reason did the barbarians have for ambushing the delegation? And where did Xu Qi’an go after parting ways with you?"

Constable Chen furrowed his brows, uncertain. "It seemed to involve the princess consort. As for Silver Gong Xu, he left the delegation to head north on his own, undertaking a separate mission."

"Seemed?" The Prime Minister narrowed his eyes with a hint of scepticism.

"This was Silver Gong Xu’s deduction, not mine," Constable Chen emphasised with a bow.

Prime Minister Wang nodded slowly, his doubt receding. He began pondering the reason the barbarians might have targeted the princess consort.

Seeing this, Constable Chen continued, "Later, we arrived in Chuzhou City but were thwarted by Que Yongxiu for several days, gaining no progress. Until that day…"

From Chen’s account, the Prime Minister gradually pieced together the events of the catastrophic battle in Chuzhou City.

After a long silence, the Prime Minister asked, "Where was Silver Gong Xu during all this?" His question was directed at the High Court Deputy.

The High Court Deputy understood immediately and bowed. "Silver Gong Xu infiltrated the northern frontier alone and collaborated with the Heaven Sect Holy Maiden, Li Miaozhen, eventually finding the sole survivor, Provincial Administrator Zheng. When the great battle erupted in the city, he had just parted ways with him."

The Prime Minister responded with a faint "Hmm" before turning back to Constable Chen. "What was Silver Gong Xu’s assessment of the mysterious expert’s identity?"

*The Prime Minister really respects Xu Qi’an’s judgement. Earlier, when I mentioned the princess consort, saying it was Xu Qi’an’s theory, the Prime Minister refrained from questioning further…*

Constable Chen answered, "Speaking of the mysterious expert, Silver Gong Xu coldly remarked one sentence."

Everyone present, including the Prime Minister, immediately turned their attention to Constable Chen.

Taking a deep breath, Constable Chen softly said, "Silver Gong Xu said, ‘The court is filled with demons and monsters wearing human faces.’"

This statement was an act of great disrespect towards those in power. Thus, Constable Chen lowered his head, not daring to meet the Prime Minister’s gaze or that of the other officials.

*Xu Qi’an suspects the mysterious expert to be someone from the court or closely connected to someone there…* Minister Sun shivered inwardly, a chill running down his spine.

Having weathered the political tides for years, Minister Sun prided himself on his understanding of court dynamics and its key players. But as he mentally reviewed potential suspects, he could think of no one capable of "commanding" such a formidable expert.

*Xu Qi’an’s words implied he had a high degree of confidence, though he could only ascertain a connection to the court, without pinpointing the exact person…* The Prime Minister’s eyes glinted briefly as a thought struck him: perhaps he could use Xu Erlang, who shared mutual admiration with Xu Qi’an, to probe the latter indirectly.

"Could it be Wei Yuan?" the High Court Minister murmured.

The Prime Minister and Minister Sun’s expressions changed subtly, while the other officials, including Constable Chen and the High Court Deputy, looked puzzled.

Wei Yuan is but an ordinary man. Why would the High Court Minister suggest such a thing?

"This is clearly impossible," the High Court Minister said, shaking his head.

What he meant was that Wei Yuan had not left the capital; he had recently attended a small court meeting in the Imperial Study. Moreover, with the court’s familiarity with Wei Yuan, it was inconceivable for someone to impersonate him.

One could mimic his face, even his mannerisms, but not his aura.

"Why was the delegation’s report not received by the cabinet?" The Prime Minister turned to the High Court Deputy.

The Deputy bowed. "The delegation believed the matter should not be sent through urgent dispatches, as it might give His Majesty time to devise a means to exonerate the Zhenbei King."

*The delegation has already briefed His Majesty, yet I remain uninformed. This means His Majesty has issued a gag order…* The Prime Minister sneered.

"So, does that mean His Majesty won’t find himself cornered?"

He mocked the delegation’s rather naive strategy before sighing. "Since that is the case, the mysterious expert’s identity can be set aside for now. What we must consider is what we aim to achieve from this event and how best to handle it."

A sixth-rank official said gravely, "If the Zhenbei King’s massacre of 380,000 civilians in Chuzhou City is not properly addressed, we will all be condemned in the history books."

Another official added, "Pressuring His Majesty to convict the Zhenbei King would not only fulfil the ideals of the sages we’ve studied but also bolster our reputations—a win-win outcome."

A third official, expressionless, said, "This official cares not for fame, only for justice in his heart."

*These officials must have been mobilised through Zheng Xinghuai’s efforts…* The Prime Minister exhaled deeply and said, "Investigate and verify the details immediately. Once the court session begins, we’ll gather with our peers and enter the palace to see His Majesty."

…

Lunch had barely ended when, under the leadership of Prime Minister Wang, a large group of officials gathered at the northern gate leading to the imperial study. However, they were promptly stopped by the Yulin Guards.

As if anticipating such a scene, a checkpoint had been set up in advance at the palace gate, barring all entry and exit. The officials, unsurprisingly, found themselves blocked outside.

“Move aside! We demand an audience!”

“The Zhenbei King has gone mad and deserves his death. However, the aftermath of his actions has not yet been addressed. We must seek justice for the 380,000 citizens of Chuzhou City.”

One official shouted passionately, righteous and indignant, as if embodying justice itself.

“As a king, he slaughtered his own people—a crime unworthy of forgiveness. King Huai must be demoted to a commoner and left to rot in the wilderness as justice to the world.”

The officials, draped in their various court robes, seethed with anger and began to push against the barricades.

“Outrageous!”

The captain of the Yulin Guards glared at the officials and shouted, “If you dare to force your way into the palace, you will be executed on the spot!”

“Bah!”

The grey-haired Provincial Administrator Zheng spat a mouthful of phlegm at the captain. Not only was he unafraid, but he also flew into a rage. “Today, this old man will stand right here. Go on, try and cut me down if you dare.”

The captain sidestepped the spit, his scalp tingling.

He truly didn’t dare draw his sword. Though trespassing into the imperial palace was a capital offence, rules were rules, but reality was another matter. In the past, there had been instances where outraged officials stormed the palace gates.

The correct course of action was to block them at all costs—better to endure being beaten than to actually draw a blade against these aged scholars. Otherwise, the consequences would be severe.

And who were these people standing before him?

The Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Six Departments, Vice Ministers, members of the Hanlin Academy, Censors of the Six Divisions... This was the very embodiment of the term "august officials."

Fortunately, the soldiers were robust and able to hold their ground against these ageing dignitaries. They endured spitting, kicking, and even slaps, but they didn’t retreat a single step.

However, the more firmly the Yulin Guards held their ground, the more tumultuous the civil officials became. At first, only a dozen or so high-ranking officials were causing a ruckus, but gradually, minor officials from the imperial city’s offices joined in.

The palace gate became increasingly chaotic, and the standoff showed no sign of resolution.

At that moment, an elegant carriage halted at a distant street corner. The curtain lifted, and a young man of unparalleled beauty, with rosy lips and pearly white teeth, stepped out.

“Erlang…”

A gentle voice came from inside the carriage. Wang Simu revealed her delicate face, speaking softly, “This act may offend His Majesty, but it is an excellent opportunity for you to make a name for yourself. Moreover, the officials gathered at the palace gate share the same intent.

“Speak your mind freely. If you can earn widespread praise in court and beyond, and if you can change my father’s opinion of you, what worry is there about your future success?”

Through deliberate efforts, news of the Zhenbei King’s massacre had spread throughout the imperial city.

Upon hearing this, Wang Simu had advised Xu Erlang to get involved.

*What does your father’s opinion of me have to do with anything…* Xu Erlang muttered inwardly. He then replied solemnly, “I came not for fame, but for my beliefs—for the people.”

Wang Simu chuckled but was about to respond when Xu Erlang suddenly stammered, “B-brother?!”

Miss Wang, startled, pulled the curtain slightly open. Following Xu Erlang’s gaze, she saw a man in a Silver Gong uniform approaching unhurriedly from a distance.

“Brother, what are you doing here?” Xu Erlang exclaimed in surprise.

“What about you?” Xu Qi’an retorted. He turned his head slightly, casting a calm glance at Wang Simu.

She forced a polite smile and quickly let the curtain drop.

Xu Qi’an removed his sabre and swatted Xu Erlang’s backside, scolding, “Xu Cijiu, you’ve got some nerve! Your elder brother is still a lonely bachelor struggling to find a wife, and here you are already wooing the young lady of the Wang family.”

“Brother, stop talking nonsense!” Xu Erlang, both flustered and embarrassed, flushed as he explained, “Miss Wang and I are friends through poetry, discussing the classics—a gentleman’s friendship.”

*A gentleman’s friendship? More like a special friendship…* Xu Qi’an mused silently. “Her matters can wait. What are you doing here?”

Xu Erlang’s expression turned serious. “I heard that the diplomatic mission returned to the capital, bringing back the Zhenbei King’s remains and news of his massacre to advance to the second rank. Brother, tell me, is it true?”

Xu Qi’an’s playful demeanour faded as he nodded solemnly.

Xu Erlang staggered back two steps, clutching his chest, his eyes instantly reddening.

He had been sceptical, but the scene before him—the officials’ righteous outrage and his brother’s confirmation—made the truth undeniable.

Xu Qi’an patted his younger brother on the shoulder and glanced at the officials. “It seems that the one in the palace doesn’t intend to condemn the Zhenbei King. While the civil officials’ pens are sharp, their words alone won’t suffice.”

“Big Brother, wait for me. I’ll be right back.”

The deaths of 380,000 people, slaughtered by their own prince—such cruelty and inhumanity were rare even in the annals of history. If he couldn’t vent his indignation today, Xu Xinnian felt he would have wasted his nineteen years of studying the sages’ teachings.

Finally, Xu Xinnian reached the edge of the crowd. Taking a deep breath, he shouted, “Make way!”

The noisy scene suddenly fell silent, and all eyes turned towards the young official. It was none other than Xu Xinnian, a scholar of the Hanlin Academy.

Many recalled the scene during the Buddhist debate when Xu Xinnian’s sharp words had enraged Master Jingchen.

The crowd parted to let him through.

Prime Minister Wang slightly turned his head, his expression impassive but his gaze lingering on Xu Xinnian, as if harbouring some expectations.

Ignoring the stares, Xu Xinnian took a deep breath and began, “Today, I heard that King Huai, for his selfish gain, massacred a city, and exterminated many lineages. Bastard! Truly his mother is angered, hence I come…”

As time passed and the sun began to set, only Xu Xinnian’s voice remained at the palace gate.

He continued his tirade for four whole hours.

And what a tirade it was! He criticised in classical prose, recited impromptu indictments, quoted ancient texts fluently, used colloquial insults, obscure allegories, and sarcastic allusions. His vocabulary was astonishingly rich, yet he skilfully avoided any sensitive remarks about the royal family, leaving no room for reproach.

The crowd of civil officials grew, from senior statesmen to junior officials, all looking at Xu Xinnian with newfound admiration.

It was like a whole new world!

If there were a civil service examination for cursing, Xu Xinnian would undoubtedly be zhuangyuan.

Even Prime Minister Wang, a veteran of decades of court battles, felt a sudden urge to recruit this young man, thinking, _With him in my camp, I would dominate court debates._

The Yulin Guards, on the other hand, hung their heads in despair, praying fervently for the young man to leave.

“Sir Xu, have some tea…”

One official offered him tea. Over the past four hours, Xu Xinnian had already refreshed his throat several times.

The officials willingly served him, hoping he would continue. For them, Xu Xinnian leaving due to thirst would be a significant loss.

Xu Xinnian sipped the tea, handed back the cup, and was about to speak again when—

“Shut up! No more cursing! No more cursing…”

At that moment, an elderly eunuch stormed out with a group of palace attendants, visibly enraged.

“You! You! You are outrageous! In six hundred years of the Great Feng’s history, has anyone ever stood outside the palace gates and cursed for four hours straight?” The eunuch was livid.

Xu Xinnian replied coolly, “Milord does not need to talk to me, this official has no time for impotent words.”

Some quick-witted officials nearly burst into laughter. Prime Minister Wang twitched slightly but stepped forward, not wanting Xu Xinnian to offend the emperor’s closest attendant further. “Has His Majesty agreed to see us?”

The eunuch nodded. “His Majesty will see the Prime Minister. The rest of you must disperse at once and stop gathering outside the palace gates.”

The officials, reinvigorated, looked at Xu Xinnian with newfound respect. In their eyes, he had accomplished something remarkable.
