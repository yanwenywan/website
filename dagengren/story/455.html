# 455. Honest announcement in the Heaven and Earth Society group

*I’m not an idiot…* Xu Qi’an gave a wry smile. “I confirmed Jinlian’s identity after returning from Jianzhou. But I’d already had my suspicions before that.”

Zhong Li had told him that Daoist Jinlian’s soul was incomplete, just like Fuxiang’s.

The consequences of a fractured soul were usually one of two outcomes: becoming an idiot or a vegetable.

Daoist Jinlian came from the Daoist Earth Sect, and the Daoist path was adept in matters of the soul, so a fractured soul wasn’t necessarily suspicious. It could have simply been lost in an accident.

But through his time spent with Li Miaozhen, he’d come to understand Daoist methods well. Li Miaozhen had helped him reconstruct his soul, and had helped Zhong Li do the same.

Daoist Jinlian’s cultivation was at least as high as Li Miaozhen’s, if not higher, so why hadn’t he reconstructed his own soul?

Where had the missing half gone?

That was the first point of suspicion.

There were many other details too, the Earth Book fragment, the nine-coloured lotus. How could an Earth Sect Daoist below Rank three snatch the nine-coloured lotus from a Rank two Daoist Leader?

Of course, those were merely suspicions, but not enough to prove Jinlian was the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect.

It wasn’t until Jianzhou, when he saw Daoist Jinlian’s soul merge with that of the Earth Sect Daoist Leader, that it all fell into place, even though the beautiful woman Bailian claimed it was an Earth Sect secret technique.

But in that moment, Xu Qi’an connected every clue.

*Not just me, anyone in the Earth Book chat group who was involved in defending the lotus in Jianzhou, apart from Lina, would likely have their own suspicions…* Xu Qi’an turned to look at Luo Yuheng, her refined, striking features serene, her clear eyes like mirrors.

“National Teacher, do you know when Daoist Jinlian fell to demons?”

Luo Yuheng thought for a few seconds and replied, “Six years ago. Jinlian failed his tribulation and fell to the demonic path. His soul split in two, his good side held onto the Earth Book fragment and helped some disciples escape, while his evil side corrupted most of the sect. That was how the Heaven and Earth Society and the Earth Sect came to be.

“At the time, Jinlian’s good side secretly entered the capital to seek help from me at Lingbao Temple. I had only just advanced to second rank and my foundation was unstable. Besides, the Earth Sect cultivates virtue, but once they fall into the demonic path, they become the vilest of all. Human Sect cultivators already walk the edge, burning with karmic fire. If we’re tainted by the Earth Sect, the only outcome would be death and destruction.”

*So six years ago, Daoist Jinlian had come to the capital? That would mean… Huaiqing received the Earth Book fragment from him then, and became a member of the Heaven and Earth Society?*

*It’s very likely.* The possibility triggered a train of thought in Xu Qi’an’s mind. “Then… did Daoist Jinlian also seek help from the Heaven Sect?”

Luo Yuheng gave a cold laugh. “Is that not obvious?”

*Then presumably, Li Miaozhen also received her Earth Book fragment around that time. But she probably didn’t know Jinlian was the Earth Sect Daoist Leader. Her master hadn’t told her either.*

“Did the Heaven Sect agree to help?”

“The Heaven Sect cultivates absolute detachment. Disciples like Li Miaozhen are the exception,” she said coolly.

Xu Qi’an understood. Luo Yuheng had feared the corruptive nature of the Earth Sect. As for the Heaven Sect Daoist Leader, his attitude was simply: “I have no emotions. It’s not my problem.”

*If Jinlian fell into demonic cultivation six years ago, that contradicts my theory…*

Luo Yuheng looked at him. “Your deductions were wrong?”

Xu Qi’an nodded, then shook his head. “National Teacher, was there anything odd about Jinlian before his fall? Did the Earth Sect descend all at once, or was it a gradual process?”

Luo Yuheng considered the question. “As far as I know, Jinlian entered seclusion to undergo a tribulation. He was in seclusion for nearly thirty years. As for the fall into demonic cultivation, I may not practise the Earth Sect’s virtue and merit, but a thousand-mile dam collapses from an ant hole. Nothing in this world happens instantly. Falling into the demonic path is never sudden.”

*Bang. Bang bang!*

Xu Qi’an felt his heart pound and swallowed.

“I think I understand now. National Teacher, hear me out…”

He paused, then began slowly, “I suspect that what King Huai and Emperor Yuanjing actually encountered at the Southern Guardens wasn’t a bear, but the Earth Sect Daoist Leader. He was already showing signs of corruption, perhaps overwhelmed by bloodlust, or performing some kind of demonic ritual. So he chose the Southern Guardens, a place where he could slaughter beasts. The capital has the Jianzheng and countless experts, there’s no way he could kill wantonly here.

“This would also explain why, in the autumn of the 26th year of Zhende, the animals in the outskirts of the Southern Guardens were nearly extinct. At the time, King Huai and Yuanjing ventured deep into the Southern Guardens on a hunt and accidentally ran into the corrupted Jinlian. All their guards died. Hah, how could a bear kill so many experts? But if it was Jinlian, then no matter how many guards there were, they’d all be doomed.

“You said just now that the Earth Sect Daoist Leader was in seclusion for nearly thirty years, then failed his tribulation and fell. That lines up exactly, thirty years ago was when he left the capital. So he must’ve already shown signs of corruption while still here.”

The more Luo Yuheng listened, the graver her expression became. She nodded. “Then why didn’t Jinlian kill Yuanjing and King Huai?”

Xu Qi’an thought for a moment, then shook his head.

“He must’ve had a purpose, but none of the clues point to what it might be, so I can’t speculate. My guess is: he corrupted them.”

Back in Chuzhou, he’d fought an avatar of the Earth Sect Daoist Leader. His strongest impression was of the overwhelming malice, capable of corrupting everything it touched.

Even the Sovereign Sword had been tainted, losing its spirit for nearly a quarter of an hour.

So corrupting Yuanjing and King Huai made perfect sense.

These weren’t wild guesses, they were reasoned conclusions drawn from existing clues.

“It could even explain King Huai’s ruthless selfishness, and Emperor Yuanjing’s nearly insane obsession with immortality. They seem normal on the surface, but were already half-mad, just like Earth Sect Daoists.”

At this, Luo Yuheng raised another question. “What about the traffickers, and the anomaly beneath the dragon ley?”

*That…* Xu Qi’an’s expression stiffened. He didn’t have a good theory for that yet.

After a moment’s thought, he said, “The Earth Sect Daoist Leader corrupting Yuanjing and King Huai may serve another purpose, but we lack the clues to uncover it.”

But Luo Yuheng’s eyes lit up with sudden realisation. “I know what it is.”

Xu Qi’an pricked up his ears.

“The Earth Sect Daoist Leader is a master of the One Qi Transforming into Three Purities technique. Jinlian and the current Daoist Leader are the good and evil halves. If he had ever used that technique, where’s the third?”

It was like lightning struck his brain. Xu Qi’an blurted out,  
“Under the dragon ley?”

“You're thinking exactly what I am,” Luo Yuheng nodded with satisfaction and said:

“Yuanjing has cultivated for twenty years, with the nation's resources leaning entirely towards him, yet he still hasn’t formed a Golden Core. It’s rather baffling. Of course, cultivation isn’t solely about resources, talent matters greatly. I used to think he was just lacking in talent, but after everything that’s happened, if he has another avatar of Jinlian behind him, wouldn’t that make more sense? Those great medicines likely went into Jinlian’s mouth too.

“He polluted King Huai and Yuanjing likely for cultivation purposes, to pave the way for breaking through to first rank. One day, the three will merge into one, breaking through in a single leap to become an Earthly Immortal.

“Of course, all of this depends on whether there truly is an avatar hidden beneath the dragon ley. But your last information wasn’t enough, it proves nothing. In a while, I’ll send an avatar with you to explore the dragon ley and verify it.

“Heh, if there really is an avatar of the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader hidden under the dragon ley, if Yuanjing really has been corrupted by him, then I’ll have no scruples about breaking with him.”

*And you don’t have to face the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader head-on either, once this comes to light, the Jianzheng can no longer turn a blind eye… Zhong Li once said that even the Jianzheng couldn’t easily manipulate the dragon ley. Hiding in it could indeed escape his notice…* Xu Qi’an’s eyes lit up. Then, recalling something else, he said in a low voice:

“National Teacher, if Yuanjing has been polluted and controlled by the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect, then his persistent desire for dual cultivation with you suddenly makes a lot more sense.”

The Earth Sect’s demon Daoists were all obsessed with wickedness and women, he’d witnessed it firsthand in Jianzhou.

It wasn’t that they were particularly lecherous; it was that men, by nature, are lecherous, and lust is the root of all evil.

As for the possibility that Yuanjing was actually the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader’s avatar, Xu Qi’an didn’t even consider it. It was impossible. Yuanjing was the emperor of a nation, bearer of national fortune, he could be influenced or polluted, but never replaced.

Moreover, being imbued with national fortune isn’t necessarily a good thing for someone in a high position. The old ancestor of the Wulin Alliance in Jianzhou had rejected such fortune precisely because he wanted to live another five hundred years.

Luo Yuheng seemed extremely sensitive to the words “dual cultivation,” especially when spoken by Xu Qi’an. She stared coldly at him for a few seconds before saying:

“In half a month, we’ll delve into the dragon ley.”

“Why half a month?”

Xu Qi’an frowned. That was too long.

Luo Yuheng hesitated slightly, then chose to be frank: “During that time, I’ll experience a bout of karmic fire.”

*You’ll be scorched by karmic fire within half a month? Please, let me extinguish it for you…* Xu Qi’an indulged in a little internal banter, but kept a gentlemanly exterior and nodded:

“Alright. I’ll contact you once you’ve recovered.”

Luo Yuheng gave a soft nod and dissipated into golden light.

A few seconds later, the door creaked open and Zhong Li poked her head in through the gap, silently observing.

“She’s gone,” Xu Qi’an said.

As soon as he spoke, the Taiping Sabre suddenly flew up and struck the door with a bang, trying to close it.

“Ugh…”

Zhong Li gagged as if choking, experiencing a moment of strangling suffocation. She slowly slid down in defeat.

*Weren’t you the one who claimed to have experience and said you could protect yourself? A seasoned Master of Prophecy shouldn’t have assumed that pose just now…* Xu Qi’an angrily summoned the Taiping Sabre and demanded to know why it bullied Zhong Li.

The sabre buzzed with vibration, conveying the sentiment: “I thought it was fun.”

*We’ll explore the dragon ley in half a month. Then everything will be clear… and I can come clean with Huaiqing and the others.* Xu Qi’an thought to himself, then looked at Zhong Li and said:

“I need to go to the Sitianjian and see little sister Caiwei.”

He intended to ask Chu Caiwei to find Huaiqing and invite her to the Xu residence for a secret meeting, rather than using the Earth Book fragment.

Because at this point, he wasn’t sure if Daoist Jinlian was friend or foe. That was why he wanted to meet Huaiqing last night, but she refused to meet “online friends.”

Of course, he’d only ask Chu Caiwei to send the invitation. Nothing more.

…

The Western Regions.

The skies over the Western Regions were clear and vividly blue, with few clouds. The land was mostly barren plains, lacking lush vegetation or verdant peaks, evoking a sense of vast, desolate space.

Mount Ananda was a Buddhist sacred site, the heart of the many Buddhist kingdoms in the Western Regions, and a holy land in the eyes of countless Buddhist followers.

It was on this mountain that the Buddha attained enlightenment and founded the Buddhist path.

On Mount Ananda, thousands of temples clustered around the summit’s Great Palace of the Radiant King. Occasionally, Sanskrit chants would echo from the mountains, solemn and grand.

As the greatest power in the Nine Provinces, Mount Ananda was considered a forbidden place among cultivators of other systems. But to Buddhist disciples, it was a destination of pilgrimage.

Across the plains, one could occasionally see dark-skinned Westerners clad in simple robes, with sweat cloths on their shoulders, prostrating every few steps on their journey to the holy land in their hearts.

Beneath a tree’s shade stood a white-robed arcanist, his features indistinct, his presence vague, gazing toward Mount Ananda in the distance.

“What brings you to Ananda?”

A gentle and melodious voice spoke, a woman’s most captivating tone.

Before the white-robed arcanist appeared a white-robed Bodhisattva. Her layered skirt trailed along the ground, and unlike Buddhist monks, she hadn’t shaved her head. Her long black hair fell loosely, fluttering in the wind.

She bore the distinct features of the Western Regions, well-defined facial contours, and rare glass-coloured eyes.

Clad in white, she exuded an elegant, unrestrained beauty that could captivate a nation.

Barefoot, her jade-like feet seemed untouched by the slightest speck of dust.

The arcanist, still gazing at Mount Ananda, paid no mind to the beauty before him and sighed, “Since the contest in the capital, the fortune of the Western Regions has begun to stir. That’s not a good sign.”

The Bodhisattva’s glass-like eyes were emotionless and remote. Her voice remained soft and pleasant:

“Du’e brought Mahayana Buddhism back from the capital. After half a year of debate at Ananda, more and more believers have turned to Mahayana. He has belittled the Way of Self-Liberation as Hinayana. A schism within the Buddhist sect is imminent.”

The arcanist smiled. “That little thief in the capital, utterly shameless.”

Prajna Bodhisattva’s tone remained gentle and pleasant: “Du’e wishes to bring the boy back and honour him as a Buddha Son. Samantabhadra is pleased, but Agaruka disapproves.”

The arcanist asked, “What does the Buddha think?”

The Bodhisattva gave him a scrutinising glance, then said coldly, “The Buddha has been in slumber for five hundred years.”

The arcanist nodded and got to the point: “I’ve come to borrow a divine artefact from your Buddhist sect.”

The Bodhisattva’s glassy eyes gazed at him, neither joyful nor sorrowful.

“Don’t be so quick to refuse, at least hear my offer,” the arcanist said with a smile.

“I’ll trade you a piece of information.”

The Bodhisattva was silent.

The arcanist’s smile widened as he slowly said, “I know where the sealed object beneath Sangpo is.”

…

After lunch, Huaiqing arrived at the Xu residence in an ordinary carriage, which came to a slow stop outside the gate.

The coachman pulled a stool from beneath the carriage and welcomed the princess. After stepping down, Huaiqing’s brows furrowed sharply, she’d sensed prying eyes from a hidden spot.

*Father Emperor has had people secretly watching the Xu residence…* Without revealing anything, Huaiqing entered the residence.

She didn’t disturb the women of the household. Led by Old Zhang from the gatehouse, she entered the inner courtyard, where Xu Qi’an was seated at a stone table, smiling and nodding at her.

Huaiqing returned the nod and followed him into a room.

Her clear, limpid gaze swept the room and noticed that Li Miaozhen was also inside.

“I had Zhong Li set up a formation to block sound. After all, what we’re about to discuss isn’t for outsiders to hear,” Xu Qi’an said, sitting down behind the desk and smiling:

“Isn’t that right, Your Highness, or should I say, One!”

Huaiqing’s usually cool and calm face froze for a moment. Her pupils contracted slightly.
