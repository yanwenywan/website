The capital, the imperial palace.

The Crown Prince held a banquet in the Eastern Palace, inviting his royal siblings. Being his immediate younger sister, Lin’an arrived early, sitting on a chair and swinging her feet under her skirt.

Today, she wasn’t wearing her usual red dress but a magnificent long dress with a purple base and gold trim. Her hair was adorned with a ruby coral crown, with coral serving as the framework, and two lifelike golden phoenixes flanking the ruby, with six strings of pearls hanging down.

Additionally, she wore other ornate accessories like golden hairpins and jade hairpins, looking lavishly and exquisitely dressed.

Purple was a colour commonly used by the concubines in the palace to highlight their elegance and nobility, which wasn’t typically suitable for young girls. However, Lin’an’s noble aura gave her the appearance of a beautifully dressed doll.

Her round face and charming peach blossom eyes made her look both enchanting and innocent, perfectly balancing multiple qualities.

There was still half an hour before lunch, and the princes and princesses gradually arrived at the Eastern Palace. Everyone was accustomed to Lin’an’s intricate style of beauty.

Among the four princesses, probably only she could pull off such an extravagant look. The other princesses wouldn’t be able to handle such opulence.

Although Huaiqing had the looks, her temperament didn’t match.

“Is Huaiqing not here yet?” Lin’an’s lively eyes darted around as she looked expectantly toward the door.

“She’s busy with duties and will come later,” the Crown Prince said with a smile, then cleared his throat:

“Today, the Sitianjian has prepared a special batch of chicken bouillon, and some were sent to the palace. I especially invited all of my brothers and sisters to taste it.”

In fact, a few days ago, Sitianjian had “offered” a batch of chicken bouillon to the imperial kitchen, and the princes and princesses had already enjoyed this addictive seasoning.

Talking about this popular topic, the princes and princesses engaged in a lively conversation.

“Indeed, the taste of chicken bouillon is irresistible, but it does make you thirsty.”

“Father mentioned yesterday that it shouldn’t be consumed too much; a diet of light flavours is the way to stay healthy.”

The princes secretly rolled their eyes at Emperor Yuanjing’s obsession with health. Only middle-aged people would be so concerned with such things. Why should young people worry about health?

Lin’an looked around, lifting her round, white chin, “Do you know who invented chicken bouillon?”

At this point, she turned into a spoiled brat, flaunting arrogantly.

The princes and princesses genuinely didn’t know the answer. Only three people in the palace knew about it: the Crown Prince, Lin’an, and Huaiqing. If they didn’t reveal it, no one else would know.

Under the curious prodding of her siblings, Lin’an raised her chin higher and said with a sweet smile, “It was Xu Qi’an, my subordinate.”

She emphasized the latter part.

“Xu Qi’an?” The Fourth Prince frowned, “Isn’t he Huaiqing’s person?”

The Fourth Prince was Huaiqing’s full brother.

“He’s mine now. He swore allegiance to me,” Lin’an boasted about stealing Huaiqing’s man.

In the eyes of their siblings, she had always been bullied by Huaiqing. Now that she finally gained an upper hand, she couldn’t help but flaunt it. The more outstanding Xu Qi’an was, the more accomplished she felt.

The princes and princesses chuckled quietly, while the Fourth Prince frowned, displeased by Lin’an’s actions.

Although he was the son of the Empress and theoretically held the highest status, the position of Crown Prince had gone to the eldest son of a concubine, Lin’an’s full brother. Moreover, Emperor Yuanjing treated his other children equally but showed special favour to Lin’an while disliking Huaiqing. This left the Fourth Prince feeling even more insecure.

*Mother had said Huaiqing is strong-willed and domineering, much like Father in his younger days, but with even more talent. If she were a man, Father would probably dislike her even more.*

“Who does Xu Qi’an belong to?”

At this moment, Huaiqing’s clear, melodious voice came from the door. The eldest princess, dressed in a moonflower-colored palace dress, had arrived.

The princes and princesses clearly saw Lin’an’s arrogance deflate instantly. She looked unwilling but quickly backed down, pouting, and said loudly, “Half to each of us!”

Using the most defiant tone to say the most submissive words.

Huaiqing snorted.

She knew about Xu Qi’an’s attempts to please both sides and tolerated it mainly because Lin’an was a silly sister with no real threat. Stealing people was just a way to spite her.

If any other prince tried to take her people, Huaiqing would retaliate without mercy. But with Lin’an, she was content with just scaring her.

Huaiqing walked up to Lin’an, looking down at her, and said coolly, “Move, I want to sit here.”

Lin’an looked up, seeing only Huaiqing’s eyes, the lower half of her face being hidden from this angle by her ample bosom.

This made her feel frustrated. This sister not only had more talent but also a better figure. Besides the Emperor’s favor, she couldn’t compete with Huaiqing in anything.

Biaobiao was a delicate girl, and felt aggrieved being bullied by Huaiqing, turningher head away.

There was nothing she could do. She couldn’t fight, arguing was beneath a princess’s dignity, and Huaiqing, being a scholar, could scold without using foul language. Lin’an couldn’t win against her.

The Crown Prince coughed and tried to lighten the mood, “Huaiqing, don’t be harsh with Lin’an, you’re her elder sister.”

Only then did Huaiqing let Biaobiao off, no longer bullying her.

…

While Eating, the Crown Prince casually remarked, "Have you heard about what happened in the Imperial Study today?"

The Fourth Prince immediately responded, "The admonitory stele and the Transport Office?"

The Crown Prince nodded, smiling, "We don't need to comment on the Transport Office matter. The court officials and Father will decide on that. But the admonitory stele incident is truly remarkable."

The Fourth Prince nodded in agreement, "*Your food and your money, flesh and blood of the people. The people are easy to abuse, the heavens are hard to cheat.*"

"An excellent poem!" Huaiqing’s eyes lit up, her elegant face beaming with radiance.

She usually remained silent during meals, but the essence of this poem stirred the eldest princess more than the lines, *Drunk, he knows not if the sky floats in the water* and *its subtle fragrance drifts with the rising moon at dusk.*

*What a terrible poem, with no artistic conception...* thought Lin’an.

Huaiqing, staring at the Fourth Prince, asked, "Who composed this poem?"

She never paid much attention to palace affairs.

The Crown Prince answered on his behalf, "It was Xu Qi’an."

"Excellent poem!" Lin’an clapped her small hands on the table, loudly praising.

"That’s just his nature," Huaiqing chuckled.

"What do you mean ‘his nature’, as if you know him well?" Lin’an retorted habitually.

Huaiqing initially didn’t want to respond but, seeing the princes all watching her, she pondered for a moment and said:

"Xu Qi’an is someone who despises evil passionately. He disregards minor faults without compromising on major principles, unlike those hypocritical scholars who only pay lip service."

"Is it true that he cut down a Silver Gong with his blade?" The Crown Prince asked with a smile.

"The other day, I had a casual chat with Duke Wei and mentioned him," Huaiqing glanced at the princes, "Duke Wei said that since Xu Qi’an joined the constabulary, he has never been corrupt, not even taking a penny."

"Then why do you say he disregards minor faults?" Lin’an felt that Huaiqing was slandering her loyal follower.

She glared at Huaiqing fiercely.

Princess Huaiqing said, "Xu Qi’an indulges in the Jiaofangsi, stays out all night, and has a close relationship with the Oiran of the Reflecting Plum Pavilion, Fuxiang."

Lin’an’s smile gradually faded, her expressive peach blossom eyes widened, and she shouted, "Nonsense."

She sulkily ate a few more bites, feeling that the food had lost its taste, then threw down her chopsticks in anger, declaring, "I’m not eating anymore."

She stood up, lifted her skirt, and left with her personal maid.

….

Lin’an storming off didn’t affect the others’ meal. The Crown Prince felt a bit awkward, so he raised his wine cup with a smile to keep the banquet going.

After the banquet, Huaiqing returned to her own courtyard, drank a large bowl of tea, and then sat in her boudoir to meditate and practice Qi cultivation.

She had secretly advanced to the Refining Qi stage. The other day, she sought out Wei Yuan for a "chat" precisely because of this matter.

Huaiqing was highly talented but had always kept a low profile. As she grew older, she felt it was appropriate to gradually enhance her cultivation.

The main thing was, for the whole year this year, Emperor Yuanjing had not once mentioned anything about arranging marriages for the princesses.

*Father focuses on cultivating immortality, and Mother is detached from worldly affairs. If Emperor Yuanjing doesn't bring it up, she won't bother either. Mother has always been like this; though she is the Empress, she is completely uninterested in her duties and status.*

"Your Highness, a letter has arrived from the manor, it was sent from Qingzhou," a guard hurried in.

By “manor”, he referred to Huaiqing’s residence within the Imperial City.

The letters for the princes and princesses generally didn't enter the palace directly but are delivered to their respective manors.

Qingzhou? Princess Huaiqing thought it was a letter from Ziyang Jushi, nodding, "Bring it here."

The guard respectfully handed it over and withdrew.

Huaiqing opened the letter. The first sentence read: *As I write this letter, I have arrived at the border of Qingzhou…*

Huaiqing immediately realized it was from Xu Qi’an. The letter was long, filling two pages. She concentrated on reading it, and her expression turned grave upon reading about the corruption case in the Transport Office in Yuzhou.

As she continued reading, the tone became less formal. The latter part wasn't a subordinate reporting to a superior but rather a man confiding in a woman he admired….

*…it comes from the earth yet is not dirtied by it, it sparkles in the water yet does not try to enchant, it is full and straight without tangled branching, its fragrance spreads far and lingers in the air. It is to be admired from afar, and not to be disrespected.*

Princess Huaiqing muttered these beautiful words, immersed in the imagery of a lotus flower in full bloom.

"It's a pity Xu Ningyan didn't study literature," Princess Huaiqing said softly, then tipped the envelope, and a withered lotus petal fell out.

*Is this kid expressing his love for me through this letter?* Princess Huaiqing fell into contemplation.

*If I were to present this letter to the palace, even ten heads falling wouldn't be enough for him.*

She folded the letter carefully, tucked it into an infrequently read book, and saved it.

Then, with great interest, she called a maid to grind ink and wrote down the poetic phrases about the lotus from the letter to hang in her study.

Looking at the writing, Huaiqing's lips curled into a faint smile.

…

“What’s wrong with Her Highness?”

“I don’t know. Ever since returning from the Crown Prince’s place, she’s been sullen.”

“Perhaps she was bullied by the Eldest Princess... but it doesn't seem like it. If the Eldest Princess had bullied her, she would’ve already cursed her out and forgotten about it.”

In the courtyard, several palace maids huddled together, chatting. Lin’an had just thrown a tantrum, and now only her two personal maids were with her in her bedroom. The others didn’t dare to approach her in such a foul mood.

“Why must Your Highness quarrel with Princess Huaiqing…” a personal maid advised.

“It’s not her!” Lin’an fumed. “It’s that damn running dog.”

The two maids were taken aback before realizing who “damn running dog” referred to. One of them had even been playfully spanked by Xu Qi’an.

The maids exchanged confused glances, thinking that the “damn running dog” had been out of the capital for over half a month.

“How did he offend Your Highness again?”

“I don’t know.” Lin’an’s expression was gloomy. “I just feel upset.”

“???”

At this moment, a guard arrived at the courtyard, requesting to see Princess Lin’an. One of the maids, recognizing him as a guard from their own residence, reluctantly knocked on the door:

“Your Highness, a guard from the residence seeks an audience. He says there’s a letter for you from Qingzhou.”

A letter from Qingzhou? Lin’an was puzzled. Her social circle was very small, consisting mostly of siblings within the palace, imperial clan siblings, and occasionally the family members of officials who would write to her, inviting her to private tea parties in their boudoirs.

But none of these connections included Qingzhou.

“Who sent the letter?” the maid asked on her behalf.

“I don’t know,” replied the maid outside.

The personal maid glanced at Lin’an, who nodded. She then turned and called out, “Bring it in.”
