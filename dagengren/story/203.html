# 203. Heh, Women

Song Tingfeng bought a few ounces of loquat candy from a street vendor. It was hard, cut into small square pieces, somewhat similar to the cough sweets Xu Qi'an had in his previous life.

You couldn't find such hard candy in the capital. This loquat candy, both soothing for the throat and sweet, was a unique specialty of Yunzhou.

*Damn, even the candy here is harder than me...* Song Tingfeng thought as he sucked on one, looking around. He sighed, "It’s the same Yunzhou, but Baidi City is so different from other places. Just look at this bustling and beautiful scene; you'd think Yunzhou is truly a place of peace and prosperity."

As they travelled, they passed through various prefectures and counties, witnessing vast stretches of abandoned farmlands and desolate, uninhabited villages. The stark reality of Yunzhou's desolation became clear.

People’s lives were hard!

"With such fertile land, there's no worry about food from farming, and living by the mountains supports three generations. Plus, being close to the open sea means abundant salt fields..." Zhu Guangxiao, usually silent, surprisingly spoke at length, feeling frustrated. "Why has it come to this?"

Song Tingfeng and Xu Qi'an shared his sentiment, the latter saying solemnly, "We came to Yunzhou to eradicate deep-rooted problems. Eliminating the Commander who colluded with mountain bandits will greatly reduce Yunzhou's banditry."

"Ningyan is right; we can't get lost in the Jiaofangsi. A real man should serve the country and the people, and make a career... Damn, what a beauty!"

Xu Qi'an and Zhu Guangxiao looked in the same direction, their eyes lighting up. Ahead, by the street, stood a breathtakingly beautiful woman.

She wore a delicately elegant dress, styled in the latest fashion, with a slender waist accentuated by a fine silk belt adorned with blue jade.

Her skin was snow-white and smooth, her eyes bright as lacquer, her red lips striking, and her sharp, pretty face was unparalleled in beauty.

*Naisu...* the word flashed through Xu Qi'an's mind.

A beauty with an oval face and big eyes was exactly Xu Qi'an's type. If she had a bit of a fox-like allure, it would be even better. The three most standard oval-faced beauties he had seen were Xu Lingyue, Huaiqing, and Number Two.

However, their temperaments were distinctly different: a pure and cute high school girl, a cold and noble strong woman, and a spirited policewoman.

But this chance encounter had the face of a seductive and enchanting woman, looking very flirtatious, which was his ideal goddess.

"Perfect, this is the beauty I've dreamed of..." Xu Qi'an's heart fluttered, feeling like he had finally found love in this lonely world. All those others like Fuxiang, Huaiqing, Lin'an, and the National Teacher were just fleeting distractions.

*Hmm?*

He soon realized something was off. No matter how pretty, she shouldn't be overwhelmingly superior to those other beauties. This inconsistency brought Xu Qi'an to his senses.

Immediately, his left thumb warmed slightly. From the jade ring given by Ziyang Jushi, a warm current flowed out, soothing his spirit.

Looking again at that stunning beauty, Xu Qi'an's pupils contracted. What he saw now was not an absolute beauty but a finely crafted paper doll.

The paper doll had the same fashionable hairstyle and wore the same luxurious dress, identical to the seductive beauty.

Its exquisite face was deathly pale, its eyes dull and lifeless.

*Hiss...*

Encountering such a strange sight in broad daylight, Xu Qi'an took a sharp breath.

*This isn't a person, it's a ghost... Caiwei mentioned before that for a ghost to exist for a long time in the world, it must either benefit from local terrain, like the female ghost in the well of my new residence... or be the spirit of a strong person who fell but whose spirit remained, though this has time limits and can't exist indefinitely...*

Xu Qi'an quickly judged that this female ghost was under someone's control, with a ghost-keeper behind it.

*This ghost is quite strong to be able to confuse even me... If it weren't for the Confucian righteous energy that wards off all evils, I might have been fooled this time...* Xu Qi'an discreetly looked away, checking his companions.

He then noticed that they had a problem too, their gazes somewhat vacant, staring dazedly at the ghost. Although they retained some rationality, they were heavily influenced by its charm.

*...Was I just looking like a lovesick fool?* Xu Qi'an felt a bit embarrassed.

"Guangxiao, Ningyan, I've started believing in love again," Song Tingfeng said, deeply enchanted by the beauty, "I plan to settle down and start a family. I've even thought of my son's name."

*That's not love; you're just lusting after her... No, she doesn't even have a body...* Xu Qi'an thought.

"You're just being lecherous," Zhu Guangxiao retorted, looking conflicted, torn between his childhood sweetheart and this love-at-first-sight beauty.

Such hesitation showed he had the same thought as Song Tingfeng.

At that moment, the stunning woman swayed her slim waist and walked gracefully towards them.

"Are you three gentlemen also out for a stroll?"

She stopped in front of them, her skirt swaying to a halt. She bowed gracefully, saying:

"Alone, I find it rather boring. May I join you three gentlemen?"

*She's targeting us...* Xu Qi'an grew wary but feigned a drooling look, hesitatingly frowning, "We're heading to Jiaofangsi, isn't that inappropriate?"

"Who's going to Jiaofangsi? If you want to go, go by yourself. Song is not that kind of person."

"Ningyan... hey, that's crude."

Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao silently stepped back, distancing themselves from him.

*Hmph, this guy is indeed a pervert, speaking so shamelessly about debauchery in broad daylight...* the demon inwardly scoffed, her smile growing even more enchanting.

*Perverts are good; Grandma is best at dealing with perverts.*

*I have Ziyang Jushi's jade ring for protection and am not afraid of evil spirits. If she makes any wrong moves, I'll strike immediately. With my preparedness, I have a great chance of winning... But it's best to leave her alive for interrogation at night...* Xu Qi'an's eyes flashed as he reluctantly said:

"If that's the case, then let's go together."

He planned to observe quietly for now. If he remembered correctly, the magical books gifted by the great Confucians included Daoist spells for dealing with ghosts.

*It seems like you're fishing for me, but actually, I'm the one fishing for you...*

…

In the teahouse, by the window

Li Miaozhen stood, her body partially turned away, using the cloth hanging by the window as cover. She observed the three men in the distance. Seeing how effortlessly her demon had infiltrated the enemy ranks, she nodded in satisfaction.

Of all the methods, beauty was always the most effective weapon against men.

*Jiang Lyuzhong is out with Inspector Zhang to inspect the people's conditions, accompanied by three white-robed Sitianjian members, and they won't be back today. Without Jiang Lyuzhong at the post station, and without an arcanist to use Qi Observation, my demon won't be discovered.*

*Although the demon excels in charm and illusions, she ultimately lacks a physical body and cannot truly engage in intimate acts with men. To maintain a long-term relationship with Xu Qi'an without being discovered, I'll have to hire a girl from the Jiaofangsi...*

*Once this is over, I'll send him a few bottles of aphrodisiac pills. So young and already so weak, he really needs to nourish himself... hehe.*

…

The four of them wandered around Baidi City, fully enjoying the local customs and eating all sorts of delicious foods.

The woman introduced herself as Susu, coming from a merchant family. Her father was a silk merchant, which is why she could afford to wear such beautiful and elaborate dresses.

She admired the three gentlemen for their remarkable appearance and talent and couldn't help but want to associate with them.

*Is it "associate" or something else... you need to make that clear...* Xu Qi'an mentally retorted. The key point was, despite such a clumsy excuse, Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao believed it. They actually believed it...

*Hmm, I can't blame them. They've already been dumbed down.*

In a tea house, in a private room, Song Tingfeng pushed some pastries towards Susu, attentively saying, "Why isn’t Miss Susu eating?"

"I am not hungry."

"Why isn’t Miss Susu drinking tea?"

"I am not thirsty."

*Afraid the water will flow out...* Xu Qi'an thought as he picked up his teacup, smiling, "Miss Susu, entering a tea house without drinking tea, are you looking down on us brothers?"

Susu immediately put on a pitiful expression, "Why would you say that, sir?"

"Ningyan, if Miss Susu doesn't want to drink, don't force her." Zhu Guangxiao and Song Tingfeng immediately reprimanded their colleague, standing up for their love interest.

*Damn it, do you two even remember your surnames anymore… Your lower heads have taken over…* Xu Qi'an gave up on the idea of using water to reveal the paper doll's true nature.

Susu pursed her lips and asked casually, "From your accents, you gentlemen are not from Yunzhou, are you?"

Song Tingfeng raised his chin, speaking proudly, "We are from the capital."

Susu gasped, covering her mouth in awe, "You gentlemen are from the capital? I've always heard that the capital is the most prosperous city in the world, full of talented people. I've longed to see it."

Xu Qi'an had to admit, in terms of how to flirt with men, this unknown female ghost was the best he had seen. Even Fuxiang was slightly inferior.

She always managed to touch the itch in a man's heart.

*This is true seduction... Crude seduction uses the body as bait, while the essence of seduction lies in mental stimulation.*

Zhu Guangxiao boasted, "We are Nightwatchers... Miss Susu, have you heard of Nightwatchers?"

Susu cooperatively shook her head, her clear, innocent eyes blinking.

Song Tingfeng took over the topic, praising the Nightwatcher constabulary. Seeing the admiration in Susu's eyes, he almost couldn't stand straight with pride.

Susu subtly guided the conversation, "What brings you gentlemen, oh no, sirs, to Yunzhou with the Inspector?"

"Of course, we’re here to investigate."

"Investigate what?"

Just as Song Tingfeng was about to speak, Xu Qi'an kicked him under the table, making him sober up a bit. He hesitated, "Miss Susu, this matter involves state secrets and cannot be disclosed."

Susu smiled charmingly, "I apologize for my impoliteness."

She admitted her mistake very graciously, without any pretense, making Song Tingfeng and Zhu Guangxiao like her even more.

*These three have quite firm wills, I need to intensify my efforts. If I don’t bring back some useful information today, Master will be angry. When Master is angry, he won’t give me a man… This Xu Qi'an has the strongest will. Though he often sneaks glances at my body, he is the most clear-headed... Hmm, Master instructed me to seduce him, the other two can be ignored...*

*This female ghost is about to reveal her true intentions. No, Tingfeng and Guangxiao can’t hold on much longer, I must act early...*

Each with their ulterior motives, Xu Qi'an and Susu exchanged a smile. Xu Qi'an spoke first, "I need to use the restroom. Tingfeng and Guangxiao, keep Miss Susu company."

Creak... Bang... The door to the private room opened and then closed.

With only three people left in the room, Song Tingfeng said, "Miss Susu...."

Susu's red lips parted slightly, exhaling a breath of insubstantial, unreal Yin energy that scattered on their faces.

Their gazes turned vacant instantly, like puppets.

In his daze, Song Tingfeng saw Zhu Guangxiao also leaving, leaving only him and Susu in the room. At this moment, Miss Susu got up gracefully and started to undress.

Her dress and undergarments were removed piece by piece…

"Miss Susu, please don't do this, I am not that kind of person."

"Miss Susu, let’s go to the post…"

The same illusion played out in Zhu Guangxiao’s mind. Unlike Song Tingfeng, he wasn’t hypocritical. As a straightforward person, he guided Miss Susu to sit on the table...

…

"Hiss!"

Qi ignited the paper. Xu Qi'an tossed the paper ashes into a wine jug, and moments later, the paper was completely burnt. Blue smoke wafted from the jug's spout, and intricate runes appeared on the surface of the roughly-made ceramic jug.

This was a Daoist spirit-sealing talisman, specifically used for capturing ghosts.

To use this talisman, a vessel was needed as a carrier—cups, bottles, pouches, jugs, and jars would all suffice. When the mouth of the vessel was aimed at the malicious spirit, the talisman would activate.

Xu Qi'an hid the jug in his robes and held the jade thumb ring tightly in his palm as he strode back to the private room.

As he approached the door, he heard two heavy breaths—men's breaths. His heart sank, and he had a bad premonition.

*I still underestimated this female ghost.*

Inside the private room, Susu seemed to have heard footsteps and called out, "Is that you, Master Xu? I don’t know why, but the two gentlemen suddenly had a fit of hysteria. Come quickly and take a look..."

Xu Qi'an, remaining vigilant while acting, "hurriedly" pushed open the door.

Inside, Song Tingfeng was hugging a pillar, crazily thrusting against it; Zhu Guangxiao was gripping the table edge, showcasing his waist strength.

"...," Xu Qi'an was stunned.

At that moment, Susu, who had been lying in ambush by the door, seized the opportunity to blow a gust of Yin energy towards him.

Xu Qi'an felt a moment of haziness, but he quickly regained clarity, as the jade thumb ring in his palm continued to emit a warm force.

He cooperatively made his pupils dilate and pretended to be under the illusion.

"Bang..." The door closed gently, and he heard a soft chuckle.

Susu paced around the private room with graceful steps, laughing softly, "Oh, men!"

She sat on a long bench, crossing her legs. She transformed from a charming and delicate woman into a cold and haughty queen.

Ignoring the two Bronze Gongs immersed in their illusions, she looked at Xu Qi'an, her delicate brows slightly raised, "I have some questions for you. Answer honestly."

Xu Qi'an, with unfocused eyes, nodded obediently like a puppet.

Susu pondered for a moment and then asked, "Is Zhou Min a spy for the Nightwatchers?"

"He is."

*...This matches what Master said!* Susu nodded slightly, no longer having doubts. She quickly added, "Tell me all the information you have gathered."

The other Bronze Gong, with vacant eyes, suddenly said, "You're dreaming!"

*Hmm?*

Susu was taken aback. Then she saw this Bronze Gong, Xu Qi'an, calmly take a wine jug out from his robes. He opened the lid and aimed the mouth of the jug at her.

"Seal!"

Throughout the process, he maintained his vacant and lost expression, so much so that it wasn’t until he took out the wine jug that Susu realized something was amiss.

The next moment, a strong suction enveloped her, pulling her spirit into the jug.

"Heh, women!"

Xu Qi'an's eyes flashed, regaining their brightness. He smiled as he closed the lid.
