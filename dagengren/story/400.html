# 400. Retreat

Yang Cuixue narrowed his eyes and followed the voice to its source. The newcomer was a young man clad in black combat attire, his hair tied in a high ponytail, with a long blade hanging at his lower back.

*He seems… seems familiar…* Just as this thought arose, he heard one of his disciples exclaim behind him, “Xu Qi’an? Why is he here?!”

The speaker was Young Master Liu, who had crossed paths with Xu Qi’an in the capital.

Seeing Xu Qi’an again, Young Master Liu was quite pleased. Back then, their acquaintance had started with conflict, but they had fought and come to understand each other. Though Silver Gong Xu’s first impression wasn’t great—after all, their first meeting had ended with his beloved sword being broken—later events had proved Xu Qi’an’s character.

Despite abducting Miss Rongrong, Xu Qi’an had not taken advantage of her. Upon realising the misunderstanding, he not only apologised but also compensated Young Master Liu with an artefact crafted by Sitianjian.

As Young Master Liu reminisced, he suddenly noticed his sect master gripping his shoulder with an expression of uncontained excitement, eyes blazing as he sought confirmation.

“H-he’s Xu Qi’an?”

Young Master Liu dumbly nodded. “I saw him in the capital. My master recognises him as well.”

Yang Cuixue immediately turned to his junior brother. Young Master Liu’s master gave a slight nod. “Indeed, that is Silver Gong Xu.”

When Yang Cuixue looked at Xu Qi’an again, the image now aligned with the portrait in his memory. There was no mistake—it was really him.

Liu Hu’s eyes widened to the size of saucers, the reflection of the young man clearly imprinted within them. He suddenly recalled the very subject he had been discussing only a few days ago.

Jianzhou and the capital were separated by over two thousand miles. Excluding major organisations with intelligence networks, most jianghu wanderers and common folk had only just begun hearing about the Chuzhou City massacre and the emperor’s self-reproach edict within the past five days.

Once the news reached Jianzhou, it caused an immediate uproar. From the jianghu to government officials, everyone was discussing it. Xu Qi’an’s righteousness had won universal praise.

With the Buddhist contest long gone, Xu Qi’an had once again risen to fame, becoming a hero and an incorruptible official in the eyes of the common people.

Those who upheld justice in the jianghu revered him even more.

And now, they were seeing this legendary figure with their own eyes.

_He really does have an extraordinary presence, a true dragon among men…_ Liu Hu inwardly admired.

The sentiments of the other jianghu wanderers were much the same, a mixture of shock and joy.

_We actually met Silver Gong Xu in Jianzhou…_ This was a tale worth boasting about.

Yang Cuixue’s expression turned serious. He straightened his robes before stepping forward and solemnly bowing. “Yang Cuixue of the Ink Pavilion pays respects to Silver Gong Xu.”

A veteran fourth rank expert, the master of a sect, bowing to a junior—this would normally be seen as a tremendous loss of face. Yet none of the jianghu warriors or Ink Pavilion disciples present found anything inappropriate about Yang Cuixue’s actions.

Xu Qi’an’s deeds—especially his role in the Chuzhou massacre case—were worthy of respect.

“Pavilion Master Yang is too polite. I do not deserve such a bow.” Xu Qi’an raised a hand in a polite gesture.

“Yang has long admired Silver Gong Xu. To finally meet in person is truly exhilarating, exhilarating indeed,” Yang Cuixue said with a broad smile, his demeanor lacking any of a sect master’s usual reserve.

_Long admired? That sounds a bit odd…_ Xu Qi’an smiled. “I have also long heard of The Pavilion Master’s great name.”

He hadn’t, but exchanging pleasantries was part of the game.

The Heaven and Earth Society disciples watched in astonishment. The previously arrogant and sarcastic Ink Pavilion master was now all smiles and deference in front of Silver Gong Xu.

Meanwhile, the jianghu wanderers and blue-robed swordsmen, who had been ready for battle, now stood relaxed with smiles on their faces. The previous hostility had vanished completely.

Among them, many of the female disciples gazed at Xu Qi’an with increasing admiration.

Chasing the brightest star was a natural instinct.

And in this moment, there was no doubt that Xu Qi’an was the brightest star in their eyes.

_He holds such incredible prestige…_ Daoist Bailian’s beautiful eyes showed a rare trace of astonishment. She had always been detached from worldly affairs, disinterested in fame and fortune, and thus had underestimated Xu Qi’an’s influence beyond her own circle.

“Pavilion Master Yang, that remark about ‘face’ was just a joke.”

After a few pleasantries, Xu Qi’an got straight to the point. He gave a solemn bow and spoke earnestly, “I have deep ties with the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect and Brother Chu. At their invitation, I have come to Yue Clan Manor to help defend the lotus seeds. I ask that Pavilion Master show some leniency.”

Yang Cuixue pondered for a moment before sighing and shaking his head. “Forget it. Since I now know that Silver Gong Xu is guarding the lotus seeds, I shall not interfere. Otherwise, I would ruin my own reputation.”

His tone was half-serious, half-joking.

“My thanks!”

Xu Qi’an then turned to the gathered warriors and spoke in a loud, clear voice. “Everyone, our meeting today is a stroke of fate. Let us part on good terms. Should you ever find yourselves in need, do not hesitate to seek my help. Xu Qi’an will do everything in his power.”

These words resonated deeply.

What mattered most in the jianghu?

Face.

Without giving others face, one could not survive in the jianghu.

And Silver Gong Xu was no ordinary figure. A single word from him carried more weight than a thousand from an ordinary man.

Liu Hu grinned and called out, “My mum loves listening to gossip. When she heard about your deeds, she couldn’t stop praising you, saying you’re a great and upright official. If she knew I stood against you…”

“I’m out. Fuck it, I don’t want my hometown folks gossiping about me either,” someone else said loudly.

“Silver Gong Xu, a promise is worth a thousand tons of gold. If we say we won’t interfere, we won’t. We may not be eloquent, but we understand this principle,” another added.

_This is what true prestige looks like…_ Li Miaozhen puffed up her cheeks slightly, feeling a tinge of jealousy.

Unknowingly, Xu Qi’an had accumulated an immense reputation.

She still remembered when he had sent a message through the Earth Book asking for her help in capturing the Jinwu Guard centurion Zhou Chixiong, who had fled to Yunzhou. Back then, he had been weak and lacked connections.

Yet, in just over half a year, both his cultivation and influence had caught up to hers.

Even the officials of the imperial court would be envious of such prestige.

Chu Yuanzhen remained silent, observing from the side. He had traveled the jianghu for years, but someone like Xu Qi’an—rising at such an unprecedented speed—was not just rare but truly one of a kind.

After a brief hesitation, Yang Cuixue transmitted a message, “The Ink Pavilion will not interfere in this matter, but the Wulin Alliance has many factions, and the Earth Sect’s orthodox Daoists are just as numerous. Silver Gong Xu, be mindful of your limits and do not act recklessly.

“Tomorrow, I will come to observe the battle. If things become dire…”

He left the sentence unfinished.

_The Ink Pavilion master has a true chivalrous heart… No wonder Jiang Lyuzhong and the others always say the jianghu is far more interesting than the court. Perhaps I should roam the jianghu more in the future…_

Xu Qi’an nodded, accepting the goodwill. He transmitted back, “Many thanks, Pavilion Master.”

Yang Cuixue waved a hand, gave a final bow, and led his disciples away.

Liu Hu and the others followed suit.

_Whew…_ The Heaven and Earth Society disciples let out a collective sigh of relief before breaking into smiles.

“Sir Xu.”

A delicate and charming voice spoke as an exceptionally beautiful young girl stepped forward, her hands clasped behind her back. She pursed her lips slightly and said, “Many thanks for your help, Sir Xu.”

She had a pair of expressive eyes, as if she had something to say but hesitated. Still young, with just the last traces of baby fat fading, her recently sharpened chin gave her a fragile, pitiful charm.

In another year or two, she would be at the age where the man she fancied might lift her dainty chin and teasingly whisper, _Little lady, tonight you’re mine._

_How old is she? Does she have a boyfriend? Can I add her on WeChat?_ Xu Qi’an’s mind ran through these three questions in quick succession. On the surface, however, he remained composed, merely nodding indifferently.

Summoning her courage, the girl stammered, “D-disciple… disciple’s name is Qiu Chanyi. Sir Xu, you… you’re also a holder of an Earth Book fragment, aren’t you?”

The moment she said this, Master Hengyuan, Chu Yuanzhen, and Li Miaozhen instinctively turned their gazes toward Xu Qi’an.

_Damn, girl, are you trying to make me socially die on the spot?_ Xu Qi’an’s expression remained stern. “I am not.”

“Huh?”

Qiu Chanyi was taken aback. She parted her lips slightly, clearly disappointed. “T-then you really came just because of Senior Sister Miaozhen and Senior Brother Chu?”

The other disciples also turned to look at him.

They hoped that Silver Gong Xu was a member of the Heaven and Earth Society, not someone merely acting out of righteousness or personal ties.

This distinction was crucial.

“I’m here to investigate a case,” Xu Qi’an said with an eye roll.

“A case?”

Qiu Chanyi tilted her head innocently. “What case could there be in the Heaven and Earth Society?”

_Why do the cats wail all night? Why does the sixty-year-old Daoist keep playing dead? Why are all the female cats in the manor suddenly pregnant? Is this a distortion of human nature or a collapse of morality?_ _Would these count as cases?_

Xu Qi’an’s lips curled into an amused smile. He replied, “Daoist Jinlian and I are close friends. Even if I weren’t a holder of an Earth Book fragment, I would still not be considered an outsider.”

Daoist Bailian shot him a curious look, puzzled as to why Silver Gong Xu would deny his identity.

“Hmm? Where is Senior Yang?” Xu Qi’an glanced around.

“No idea. He disappeared the moment those jianghu ruffians showed up,” a disciple answered.

_Where has Yang Qianhuan run off to show off this time…_ Xu Qi’an analyzed, “Word of my arrival will spread through those people. There’s a small town not far from Yue Clan Manor, isn’t there?”

The disciple who had spoken earlier nodded.

“What is your Daoist name?” Xu Qi’an asked.

“Silver Gong Xu, I am Lingyun,” the young disciple answered.

Xu Qi’an nodded. “Lingyun, I have a task for you. Disguise yourself and head to the town immediately. Gather intelligence and see how all the factions are reacting.”

Lingyun’s eyes shone with excitement. “Sir Xu, rest assured. I will complete the mission!”

In a secluded corner, Yang Qianhuan squatted on the ground, drawing circles in the dirt with his finger as he muttered, “I understand now… I understand… First, I must build up my reputation…”

…

A dozen miles from the manor lay a small town, modest in scale, with a low-class brothel, two inns, and a restaurant.

The restaurant, called Three Immortals Inn, was famous for its roast chicken, crab roe buns, and plum wine—hence its name, symbolising three heavenly delights.

On a scorching summer day, there was little more satisfying than a chilled jar of plum wine and a plate of roast goose.

Recently, the town had been flooded with jianghu warriors. The inns and brothel were packed, yet they still couldn’t accommodate the sheer number of martial artists flocking to the area.

Some ended up staying in private homes. In most places, common folk wouldn’t dare to take in jianghu folk—especially if there were young wives in the household.

But the people of Jianzhou had a high tolerance for them.

This was because, to some extent, the jianghu factions in Jianzhou played a role in maintaining local order. Even outsiders, no matter how fierce, would restrain themselves here, wary of provoking the Wulin Alliance.

Of course, there were those who feared no one—not even the Wulin Alliance. But such individuals, regardless of their moral standing, rarely stooped to bullying common folk.

Ever since the warriors who had tested Yue Clan Manor returned, the entire town had been in an uproar.

Xu Qi’an had arrived.

Yes, the very same Silver Gong Xu—the man who had executed the National Dukes at the marketplace.

The news was explosive. The capital was two thousand miles from Jianzhou, and the news of the Chuzhou massacre had only just reached Jianzhou a few days ago, shocking both the jianghu and the imperial court.

Yet now, the man spoken of in countless taverns, the legendary righteous Silver Gong Xu, had appeared in Jianzhou.

“Did you hear? Silver Gong Xu has arrived at Yue Clan Manor! He’s acquainted with the Earth Sect’s traitors. Even Pavilion Master Yang of Ink Pavilion has declared he won’t get involved.”

“Well, Pavilion Master Yang is a man of integrity. He prefers to associate with righteous warriors, so of course he wouldn’t fight Silver Gong Xu.”

“I wonder how many other Jianzhou sects will back out now? If it’s only the Ink Pavilion, heh, then Pavilion Master Yang is going to be quite pleased with himself.”

“Exactly. All the credit for being righteous will go to the Ink Pavilion. I think I’ll withdraw as well. Silver Gong Xu is a man of honour—if he’s protecting something, I’d feel ashamed to try and take it.”

“You must be drunk already. Someone like you wouldn’t last a second against Silver Gong Xu.”

Three men happened to be passing by an inn and overheard this conversation.

Their group was an unusual one.

The man in the center was a white-robed young noble, refined and elegant, with a face as fair as jade. His features were outstanding, yet his brows carried a cold, sinister air.

Flanking him were two towering giants, each over nine feet tall. Both wore conical hats and black robes, standing silently on either side of the white-robed noble.

“Xu Qi’an is in Jianzhou too?”

The white-robed noble’s lips curved into a chilling smirk. “Wearing out iron shoes for nothing gained, only to have it fall right into your palm. To think I planned to visit him in due time, yet he falls into my lap instead. This trip wasn’t wasted.”

The giant to his left said in a deep voice, “Young Master, the master instructed you not to provoke him.”

The giant on the right remained silent.

The white-robed noble chuckled. “He’s just a minor upstart who seized another’s nest. How long can he possibly remain dominant? One day, I’ll flay him, extract his marrow, and grind his bones.”

His tone was brimming with confidence, as if this outcome was already predetermined.

The giant on the left advised, “Though his rise is not yet complete, his skills are formidable. Young Master must not underestimate him.”

The giant on the right remained silent.

The white-robed noble grew impatient. “Yes, yes, I know. I have never underestimated him. You two are like one mute and one nag—how utterly dull.”

The left guardian and right guardian were the men his father had assigned as his protectors. Annoying as they were, they were undeniably top-tier warriors. The white-robed noble had never seen them lose a fight.

Idly stroking his jade ring, he mused, “I heard Xu Qi’an’s sabre was personally forged by the Jianzheng. Hmm… I suppose I should take it as a down payment.”

The giant on the left remarked, “That saber is peerlessly sharp. It might rival ‘Moonshadow.’ If Young Master acquires it, it would be a fine weapon.”

The giant on the right remained silent.

The white-robed noble laughed aloud. “Come, I hear there’s a gathering at Three Immortals Inn. Let’s join in the fun. Wanhua Tower’s Mistress is said to be quite the beauty.”
