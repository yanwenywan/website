# 373. Heaven Punishes the Unjust

The man who suddenly appeared seemed to have been lurking in Chuzhou City for a long time, waiting for this very moment to seize the Sovereign Sword.

He was dressed in an azure robe, his jet-black hair tied up with a crude jade hairpin.

Although he had an unremarkable face, the way he wielded the Sovereign Sword and faced six top-tier experts alone—with calm composure and an untamed gaze—made everyone watching instinctively acknowledge his strength.

This was someone capable of contending with six top-tier experts simultaneously.

*Damn it! Not only is the Zhenbei King refining blood pills, but he also arranged so many contingencies, gathering such a number of elite powerhouses to ambush me and Zhujiu...* The chief of the Qingyan Tribe's expression drastically changed. He took several steps back and extended his palm.

A vortex of air whirled in his palm with a "whoosh." On the distant city wall, blades—some broken, some intact—began to gather toward Jili Zhigu like a school of swimming fish.

_Hiss hiss..._ The steel fish formed by the weapons melted into molten iron the moment they touched the vortex.

The molten iron condensed continuously, impurities were eliminated, and it re-formed into a gigantic sword as large as a door—something no ordinary person could wield.

"Does the Great Feng royal family have another high-ranked martial artist? Did someone advance after the battle of Shanhai Pass? Impossible. There’s no such person in the royal family. But if you’re not one of them, how can you wield the Sovereign Sword?"

The giant serpent Zhujiu slithered, crushing one house after another, and raised its massive body near the city wall, cautiously observing the azure-robed man.

Zhujiu voiced the question in everyone's hearts. Their eyes turned to the azure-clad young man.

But his response was silence.

The high-ranked warlock, his body surging with blood energy and an illusory battle soul floating above his head, cast a divination on the spot. Soon, he found that the Zhenbei King, Jili Zhigu, Zhujiu, and the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect were all staring at him.

… The high-ranked warlock opened his mouth slowly and said, "I cannot divine it. He carries an artefact that shields heaven’s secrets."

*An artifact that shields heaven’s secrets?*

The experts examined the azure-clad man warily, their curiosity about his identity deepening.

*He carries the aura of a fragment of the Earth Book. He must be its owner...* In the centre of the black lotus, the humanoid figure made of viscous, inky liquid sensed a familiar presence. Propelled by oil-like fluid, it left the lotus, rose into the sky, and stared maliciously at Xu Qi’an, roaring:

"Who are you? Who are you..."

The gathered experts were stunned by the Earth Sect Daoist Leader's reaction. His words suggested both recognition and unfamiliarity.

The high-ranked warlock frowned. "Do you know him? Who is this person?"

The black figure ignored him, its gaze filled with malice and decay locked onto Xu Qi’an. It roared from above, "Where is Jinlian? Where is Jinlian?"

_Jinlian?!_

*Isn’t he Jinlian... the same Jinlian who fell into demonic cultivation...* The high-ranked warlock frowned deeply.

*This person not only can wield the Sovereign Sword but also seems deeply connected to the Earth Sect. Judging by the Daoist Leader's attitude, they are likely enemies rather than allies...* Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu, unaware of the Earth Sect's secrets, found the uninvited guest increasingly enigmatic.

The woman in the white dress gazed intently at him, her interest piqued. She knew nothing of Xu Qi’an’s connection to the Earth Sect Daoist Leader.

At this moment, Xu Qi’an spoke slowly: "Jinlian once asked me to help him purge his sect and slay the demonic Daoist Leader. I did not refuse. I simply told him that I would assist when I had the leisure. Jinlian agreed readily."

"!"

The black figure retreated dozens of miles in an instant, glaring viciously at him like a ferocious beast wary of a powerful hunter.

Heilian was the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect and a peak second rank expert. Yet this person had casually uttered the phrase "purge his sect"... Zhujiu and Jili Zhigu felt a chill, realising that neither the Sovereign Sword nor this man’s overwhelming aura could be underestimated.

*He’s not bluffing? Judging by Heilian's reaction, Jinlian doesn’t seem to have completely fallen into demonic cultivation. Although the details are unclear, if Jinlian sought this mysterious figure’s help, it must mean he truly possesses such strength...* The high-ranked warlock felt a growing sense of unease.

Every warlock skilled in divination loses their sense of security when events veer off the predicted path.

...

The fierce battle subsided. The commotion had drawn the attention of surviving jianghu folk and city guards in Chuzhou City.

As the provincial seat, Chuzhou had seen countless jianghu warriors flood in over the past month. Though many had perished in the recent chaos, a small number survived.

Chuzhou City was vast, and while they could not see the battlefield, the sudden cessation of the terrifying shockwaves stirred speculation among the survivors.

"Is it over? Who won—was it the barbarians or the Zhenbei King?"

"It must be the Zhenbei King! If he lost, we’d all be dead."

"Should we go check it out?"

"Are you insane? By the way, what’s going on with the civilians in Chuzhou City?"

Barbarian cavalry and Yao forces had engaged the Great Feng army, but the fighting was not intense. With the city walls breached, the leaders and nobles of both sides had turned to fierce combat within the city.

There was no need for mutual destruction now; more effort was spent on containing each other.

Even seasoned soldiers and savage barbarians cherished their lives and avoided unnecessary sacrifices.

Thus, soldiers on all sides had the luxury to observe the city’s developments.

Standing on the city wall, Que Yongxiu watched the sudden appearance of the azure-robed man uneasily. He couldn’t decide if his unease stemmed from the man’s resemblance to Wei Yuan in demeanor, which made him instinctively wary, or from the instability caused by the intervention of such a high-ranked expert.

Perhaps it was both.

*The city of Chuzhou must be reduced to ruins, and all survivors within it must die, including the delegation. Only in this way can I bury the truth of the massacre. As long as there’s no evidence, with the Zhenbei King’s protection, my title as a first-rank duke, my lineage as a descendant of the founding generals, and the achievements I’ve accumulated in guarding the northern frontier over the years—even Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen cannot touch me.*

*Let us hope everything proceeds according to plan. But who is this man? Why can he wield the Sovereign Sword? Does the royal family still harbour such a formidable figure? What is his stance? Hmm, King Huai is a kin of the emperor. His ascension to Rank Two is of utmost importance. If this man can wield the Sovereign Sword, it suggests he belongs to our Great Feng's camp.*

*Surely, he would rejoice in Zhenbei King’s breakthrough and lend his support.*

Thoughts flickered through Que Yongxiu’s mind as he continuously weighed the pros and cons.

Somewhere else, Yang Yan leaped onto a rooftop, gazing out at the distant battlefield.

With his sharp eyesight, even from afar, he could clearly see the changes in the scene, the figure of the unknown man in azure robes, and the Sovereign Sword in his grip.

Yang Yan stared at the figure, his gaze momentarily dazed.

“Gold Gong Yang, what’s happening? Why has the battle stopped? What do you see?”

Below the rooftop, the Deputy Justice of the High Court shouted hoarsely.

The guards and soldiers of the diplomatic envoy remained vigilant, watching for Yao, barbarians, or even the Zhenbei King’s troops who might launch an attack.

Yang Yan retracted his gaze and replied in a calm tone, “A mysterious master has appeared. He has taken the Sovereign Sword.”

“What?”

The two censors and the Deputy Justice of the High Court were shocked.

*When did the Sovereign Sword arrive in Chuzhou? Was it not always enshrined in Yongzhen Shanhe Temple to stabilise the nation’s fortune?*

*And a mysterious master wielding the Sovereign Sword? How could this be?*

Years ago, Emperor Yuanjing had personally handed the Sovereign Sword to the Zhenbei King. Not only was the king an unparalleled warrior at the time, but the sword would not acknowledge anyone who wasn’t part of the royal lineage.

The Sovereign Sword was the sword of the founding emperor, following him in his mighty campaign, slowly accumulating the Great Feng’s fortune.

It had a spirit of its own.

“Who—who is he?” the Deputy Justice of the High Court stammered.

Yang Yan shook his head and murmured, “He reminds me of Duke Wei during the Battle of Shanhai Pass.”

Saying this, he fell silent, offering no further explanation.

“Is this mysterious master friend or foe?” Censor Liu asked.

“I don’t know.” Yang Yan shook his head, then added, “But if he can wield the Sovereign Sword, perhaps he is one of Zhenbei King’s hidden assets.”

The Deputy Justice’s face darkened.

Gritting his teeth, Censor Liu said, “So this massacre was planned long in advance, all to push King Huai forward, helping him ascend to Rank Two. For this, the Sovereign Sword was deployed, and 380,000 citizens sacrificed.

“Three hundred and eighty thousand lives! They had elders and children, husbands and wives, mothers and sons. All gone, slaughtered. How could they? How could they? I can’t accept this!”

Witnessing the blood sacrifice of the city first-hand was far more impactful than simply reading about it in official documents.

It was enough to nearly drive Censor Liu to despair.

… 

The Zhenbei King narrowed his eyes, then smiled slightly.

“You’ve come at the perfect time to break our stalemate. The northern Yao and barbarian tribes have repeatedly raided our borders, pillaging and slaughtering. Now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Kill them, and the northern frontier of the Great Feng will know eternal peace.”

He paid no heed to the man’s identity for now. But the fact that he was recognised by the Sovereign Sword meant he could not be from the Yao or barbarian clans.

Stoking animosity, the Zhenbei King sought to leverage the long-standing enmity between Great Feng and the barbarian tribes to persuade this mysterious master to join forces with him against Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu.

As for the massacre of the city, he’ll get to that after he has retrieved the Sovereign Sword.

Hearing the Zhenbei King’s words, Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu became highly vigilant, shifting much of their focus toward Xu Qi’an, wary of his potential assault with the Sovereign Sword.

“I’m here to kill you!”

The azure-robed man’s words left all the peak-level experts stunned, their faces showing shock.

The Zhenbei King’s smile gradually faded. He fixed his sharp gaze on Xu Qi’an and said, “What did you say?”

Xu Qi’an ignored him. Slowly, he floated into the air, rising high. Then, a jet-black flame-like rune emerged from his brow.

His body began to swell, tearing through his clothes. The skin exposed was inhuman, black as forged steel, exuding explosive power.

At that moment, Xu Qi’an was more sinister than the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect, enveloped in black demonic flames, appearing both divine and demonic.

“W-who is this man?”

The high-ranked warlock’s face was filled with shock.

When had Jiuzhou birthed such a peak-level martial artist?

On the walls, in the city, surviving jianghu folk, barbarians, northern soldiers, and Yao all simultaneously felt the sinister, overwhelming power emanating from Xu Qi’an.

It made them almost drop their weapons, their hearts filled with the urge to flee.

“Zhenbei King, you deserve death!”

In the air, Xu Qi’an, cloaked in black flames, his voice thundered like the roar of a god, a decree from the heavens.

“Zhenbei King, for your selfish pursuit of ascension, you massacred 380,000 citizens of Chuzhou City. Each life lost was because of you.

“The people of the north revered and loved you, treating you as their protector against the barbarian invaders, their guardian deity. But how have you repaid them?

“You colluded with the Church of the Warlock God, turning them into the walking dead, using their blood essence in forbidden rituals for an entire month. Such atrocities are unforgivable.

“Zhenbei King, can you face the people of the Great Feng who adored you? Can you face the founding emperor who established this nation through hardship? Can you face the ancestors and spirits of the past? Can you face the 380,000 wronged souls, who died under your command?

“You’re an animal.”

Each word struck like a thunderclap.

As Xu Qi’an spoke, images flashed through his mind—citizens collapsing in agony, their pleas for mercy ignored, blades piercing their hearts.

The scholars who stood firm against tyranny, their lives extinguished brutally, yet their gazes remained unyielding.

The young mother shielding her child with her body, unable to protect them as both were skewered together, her eyes filled with despair.

The second son of the Provincial Governor Zheng crying in pain before his death, and the governor himself sobbing uncontrollably.

The voices of the wronged souls roared, wept, and lamented in his mind.

Xu Qi’an wavered under the weight of their cries. Today, if the Zhenbei King did not die, it would haunt him forever.

…

Tens of thousands of soldiers from the Northern Border stirred uneasily, doubting their ears.

"He said the Zhenbei King committed mass slaughter? That the citizens of Chuzhou City were sacrificed through his collusion with the Church of the Warlock God?"

"Impossible! The citizens of Chuzhou were alive and well before the Yao and the barbarian clans attacked the city. It was their vile sorcery that killed everyone in the city."

Murmurs spread among the soldiers, echoing through their ranks.

Some cursed loudly, some were bewildered, and others defended the Zhenbei King passionately, unable to accept such accusations.

Restricted by their positions and knowledge, the rank-and-file soldiers had no understanding of the Zhenbei King's schemes, let alone the secret of refining blood pills. Even though they had just witnessed the bizarre phenomena in the city, they lacked the insight to grasp what had occurred.

The soldiers who had participated in the massacre that day were already corpse soldiers under the control the high-ranked warlock.

The Church of the Warlock God, adept at manipulating corpses and souls, as well as stirring blood energy, also had the means to refine pure blood. However, the prerequisite was that these people had to be dead—warlocks could not control the living.

Using corpse control methods to refine blood was both covert and secure, ensuring that neither the Yao nor the barbarian clans uncovered the truth. Even arcanists had been deceived.

The souls of the deceased citizens were sealed within their bodies until the blood pills were refined. Only then did they realise they had died long ago.

How could the rank-and-file soldiers possibly comprehend such intricacies?

Apart from the soldiers, the surviving jianghu warriors in the city were struck dumb by the accusations hurled from above.

Then, doubts began to rise in their hearts, feeling that the terrifying, flame-wreathed figure must be slandering the Zhenbei King.

The Zhenbei King had guarded the border for over a decade, defending against the barbarian clans and preserving the land. He was widely regarded as the mightiest martial artist in the Great Feng. His accomplishments were well-known across the nation.

Now, a mysterious figure suddenly appeared, accusing the Zhenbei King of mass slaughter. How could anyone believe it?

"Nonsense! I hope the Zhenbei King cuts him down immediately!"

"If the situation turns dire, even as commoners, we must do our part for Chuzhou. We Chuzhou folk are not afraid of death!"

"But… that person is holding the Sovereign Sword. I've heard only members of the royal family can gain its recognition. Could his words actually be true…?"

……….

"Well said! He's voiced what I've held in my heart for so long. What is a king? With such atrocities, he is no different from a beast!" Censor Liu trembled with emotion, spittle flying as he declared, "This man must be a hidden master of the Great Feng royal family, here to uphold the will of Heaven and bring justice to the Zhenbei King."

"Exactly! If sacrificing civilians is the price for advancing to Rank Two, then the Great Feng deserves to crumble. The Zhenbei King is utterly wrong—grievously so!" The High Court deputy justice declared, his outrage palpable.  

The officials never imagined that a powerful figure would appear to condemn the Zhenbei King, exposing his crimes and boldly proclaiming his intention to execute him.

Despite their hardened hearts, when the mysterious figure rebuked the Zhenbei King, they felt a glimmer of hope—a belief that justice would prevail over evil.

"Civilians may fall in war, to the swords of the barbarian clans and the Yao. At worst, we will retaliate! Today they massacre a Great Feng city; tomorrow, we annihilate one of their clans. Such enmity is eternal and irreconcilable."

Constable Chen clenched his fists, his voice trembling with rage:

"But the citizens should not die by the hands of the Zhenbei King. Until the moment of their deaths, they believed the Zhenbei King was their pillar of strength, the hero who shielded them from harm. Yet this hero turned his blade upon them, draining their blood to fuel his advancement to Rank Two. What tragedy!

"How could the Zhenbei King do it? He is nothing but a treacherous scoundrel, a cold-blooded beast!"

Constable Chen, driven by the righteousness of a martial artist, abandoned all respect for the Zhenbei King's kingly status. All he thought was that this man deserved death.

As for what would happen to the Northern Border after the Zhenbei King's death?

Ha! A king who could sacrifice an entire city for his selfish desires—should they wait for him to advance to Rank One and sacrifice ten cities next time?

Even the barbarian clans, with their raids and pillaging, had not killed as many as the Zhenbei King.

After the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the barbarian clans had spent over a decade recuperating. While they continued to harass the borders, their actions were limited to small-scale raids, never escalating to full-scale war.

But the Zhenbei King?

380,000 thousand lives—gone in an instant.

When he sought to advance to Rank One in the future, what would happen then?

The others understood this all too well, which was why the High Court deputy justice had bitterly declared that he hoped the barbarian clans would prevail in this battle.

……….

The Zhenbei King remained impassive, his voice resonant: "Who are you, sir, to spew such slander and tarnish my name?"

Que Yongxiu's expression darkened as he gripped the hilt of his sword tightly. This man was no ally—he had come to kill King Huai!

*Damn it! Damn it! He must die! Who is this wretched dog, and why is he ruining my plans—ruining King Huai's plans?* Que Yongxiu seethed with fury, a vein bulging.

Hearing the Zhenbei King's words, Que Yongxiu took a step forward, standing atop the battlements as he shouted, "Soldiers! Today is all part of a grand conspiracy by the Yao and the barbarian clans. They seek to harm our Zhenbei King!"

The Northern Border soldiers immediately realised the truth, their outrage ignited.

"The Yao and the barbarian clans not only want to harm the Zhenbei King, but they also aim to tarnish his reputation. Detestable! They deserve to be slaughtered to the last!"

"The Zhenbei King has guarded the border for so many years without returning to the capital. He is the hero of the Great Feng! Don’t let that man deceive you!"

"The Zhenbei King must not die! He is the martial god of the Great Feng—our nation needs him, and so do the people!"

"We will protect the Zhenbei King with our lives!"

The soldiers' bloodlust surged, and they were ready to pave an escape path for the Zhenbei King with their bodies if necessary.

At that moment, high in the sky, Xu Qi’an tossed the Sovereign Sword, letting it plunge into the ground with a resonant clang.

"Zhenbei King, the Sovereign Sword has a spirit. It discerns loyalty from treachery and knows the hearts of men. If your conscience is clear, then ask it to choose you."

Xu Qi’an faintly heard the sword hum as if it were mourning, lamenting the betrayal of being cast aside.

In that instant, the distant clamour abruptly ceased.

On the city walls, soldiers peered down intently at the Zhenbei King and the Sovereign Sword, afraid to blink.

The soldiers below the walls, unable to see what was happening, were anxious, wishing they could sprout wings and fly up to witness the outcome.

By now, except for a few isolated skirmishes, most combat had ceased. The Yao, the barbarian clans, and the Great Feng soldiers watched warily from a distance while splitting their attention to the unfolding drama.

*The Sovereign Sword recognizes fate, not people. As a Great Feng king, my reputation still stands, hence so does my fate. There is no way the sword won’t respond to me…*

The Zhenbei King smiled faintly and reached for the ancient sword of the founding emperor. Guided by his qi, the sword began to rise, seemingly ready to be drawn.

Upon seeing this, Zhujiu, Jili Zhigu, and the woman in the white dress instinctively attempted to intervene. However, their earlier retreat had left them too far away.

Now, it was too late to stop what was about to unfold.

“Buzz…”

Suddenly, the bronze sword radiated a faint golden glow, shaking off Zhenbei King's attempt to draw it closer and refusing his touch.

The Sovereign Sword had rejected King Huai…

Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu exchanged a glance, communicating telepathically:

“This man’s identity is unknown, but his background far exceeds our expectations. We must not underestimate him. Even though he targets the Zhenbei King, he will most likely not spare us either.”

“The Zhenbei King’s life or death is irrelevant. Securing the blood pill is our true goal.”

From the heart of the lotus, the jet-black figure stared at Xu Qi’an with doubt and unease. Though this man was undoubtedly blessed with deep fortune, he was not a figure of great destiny. How, then, could the Sovereign Sword treat Zhenbei King as though he were worthless rags in comparison?

“Zhenbei King… who exactly is he? Does your royal family still hide such a formidable master? Is he one of your ancestors?” The high-ranked warlock trembled with shock, a feeling he had not experienced for years.

Zhenbei King’s face darkened. He replied in a heavy tone, “From Emperor Gaozu to Emperor Wuzong, which peak martial artist of our royal family has ever attained eternal life? He is not one of us.”

Even as he spoke, his figure blurred, and he appeared before the Sovereign Sword, reaching out to seize it.

“Buzz!”

A brilliant golden light exploded from the sword, sending a tidal wave of energy outward and pushing Zhenbei King back. Countless arcs of sword energy lashed out, colliding with the physique of the Rank three martial artist and creating a shower of sparks.

The Sovereign Sword… this divine weapon that upheld the Great Feng’s fortune, this blade that had once accompanied Zhenbei King in the Battle of Shanhai Pass and slain countless foes, now reacted so violently to his approach.

On the distant city walls, uproar ensued among the soldiers.

At least ten thousand troops stood upon the walls, witnessing the Sovereign Sword reject Zhenbei King, resisting his touch.

It was as if something fundamental within them had shattered.

“What am I seeing? I must be under an illusion. I saw the Sovereign Sword repelling the Zhenbei King!”

“The Zhenbei King… did he really massacre the city?”

“This can’t be true. It can’t be true!”

Weapons clattered to the ground as many soldiers clutched their heads in anguish, muttering to themselves in denial. Some desperately questioned their comrades, hoping for a different answer, only to find that their companions had also broken under the weight of the revelation.

Faith crumbled.

The Sovereign Sword was the sacred weapon of Great Feng, passed down from the founding emperor. To the army men, it was a revered symbol.

During the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the emperor himself conducted a grand ancestral rite, personally bestowing the Sovereign Sword upon the Zhenbei King.

That historical event was still recounted within the army, celebrated as one of the Zhenbei King’s many glories.

For this reason, seeing the Sovereign Sword reject him was an unbearable blow to the soldiers.

Those beneath the city walls couldn’t see what was happening clearly, but as the uproar erupted above them, countless soldiers raised their heads. Instead of cheers, they heard shouts of despair and saw faces twisted in anguish.

This…

The truth became self-evident. The Sovereign Sword had made its choice, and that choice dealt a crushing blow to the soldiers.

It confirmed that the mysterious warrior in the sky spoke the truth. The Sovereign Sword rejected Zhenbei King because he had committed unforgivable crimes.

He had slaughtered the Great Feng’s people. He had become estranged from the Sovereign Sword.

“Heaven punishes the unjust. Zhenbei King, today is your day of reckoning.”

Xu Qi’an descended like a meteor, wreathed in endless wrath and dragging with him a monstrous aura of demonic flames.

With a whistle, the Sovereign Sword flew into Xu Qi’an’s hand, as if offering itself willingly. He was domineering and majestic, like a deity and a demon combined… though in truth, he was just a voice actor.

The Sovereign Sword erupted with dazzling golden light, slashing mercilessly toward Zhenbei King.

Unperturbed by the sword’s fearsome edge, Zhenbei King’s face darkened further as he raised his sabre in response.

“Boom!”

It was as though hundreds of cannons had fired simultaneously. A cataclysmic shockwave tore through the surroundings, annihilating everything in its path. Ruined buildings were swept clean, and the soldiers on the walls saw a circular wave ripple outward, obliterating all it touched.

This scene could only be described as a natural disaster.

The Zhenbei King’s sword disintegrated into dust. It had been a supreme artefact crafted by Sitianjian, capable of cutting through steel and enduring Rank three combat. Yet before the Sovereign Sword, it was pathetically fragile.

Seizing the moment, the crimson serpent opened its vertical eye and unleashed a jet-black beam faster than lightning, striking Zhenbei King squarely.

For an instant, Zhenbei King’s body froze, his joints stiffening as he watched helplessly while the bronze sword descended upon him.

“Die!”

In the distance, the warlock extended his hand and clenched it into a fist, casting a curse.

The unbreakable body, surrounded by demonic flames, suddenly suffered an invisible attack. Bearing the damage, his strike was momentarily disrupted.

The Zhenbei King seized the opportunity, unleashing a barrage of punches in an instant. The sheer speed condensed hundreds of strikes into a single, thunderous boom.

Like a cannonball, Xu Qi’an hurtled through the air, his chest briefly concave before rapidly regenerating.

Nine fox tails unfurled behind him, creating a screen in the high heavens to halt his retreat.

As he steadied himself in midair, a torrent of black liquid surged upward from below, resembling a geyser of oil, threatening to engulf him in its corrosive and corruptive flow.

Boom! Boom! Boom! A massive azure giant charged forward, leaping into the air like a predator descending upon its prey.

The giant’s sword became a blazing sun, slicing down with overwhelming force.

The black lotus beneath crumbled under the relentless sword energy, dissipating into smoke before reforming in the distance.

Xu Qi’an’s strike fractured the earth, creating a deep and jagged chasm stretching for miles.

“I detest it when people hit me with their fists.”

This time, the voice belonged to Shenshu himself.

Behind the black demonic figure, twelve shadowy, muscular arms emerged, each one tightly clenched into a fist.

Twelve fists fell simultaneously, their speed blinding, leaving craters several meters wide on the ground with every strike.

The Zhenbei King moved like lightning, alternating between charging and weaving, relying on his martial instinct to evade the rain of fists.

The chaos unfolded across the city as the fight intensified. No longer a one-on-one duel, the combatants now focused on coordination amidst the uneven numbers.

Techniques from various schools interwove like a deadly tapestry, laying waste to the capital of Chuzhou. Houses crumbled into ruins, ruins became pits, rivers shifted course, and lakes vanished under the chaos.

Since the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the lands of Jiuzhou had enjoyed twenty years of peace; this level of carnage was unprecedented.

For these combatants at the peak of all life, a human city would be razed flat in a single battle.

Seizing the opportunity provided by the three others distracting their opponent, Jili Zhigu leaped into the air and grabbed the Blood Pill from the debris.

“This blood pill contains the lives of countless people of our Great Feng, and you, a barbarian, think you’re worthy?”

Xu Qi’an was the first to intercept, slashing at the azure giant’s arm with the Sovereign Sword. The blade revealed white bone but failed to sever it in one strike.

The body of a Rank Three martial artist was formidable beyond measure. Even the Sovereign Sword, while capable of inflicting genuine damage, could not completely destroy with ease.

*If only I had the Confucian Sage's carving knife,* Xu Qi’an lamented internally, recalling it was far away in the capital, sealed by the academy.

The Blood Pill soared skyward, but before it could escape, nine fox tails coiled toward it. Simultaneously, a crimson serpent lunged, its massive body blocking out the sun as it tried to swallow the pill whole.

The Zhenbei King, the Daoist Leader’s avatar, and the warlock all acted swiftly, vying for the Blood Pill.

With a resounding crack, the Blood Pill shattered under the struggle, splitting into seven fragments.

Without hesitation, Zhujiu and Jili Zhigu devoured their fragments. Their injuries healed instantly, their auras surged, and their physical and qi strength reached new heights.

Facing the circumstances, the warlock also consumed the fragments to maintain his state for the battle ahead.

The Zhenbei King’s face darkened, veins bulging across his forehead as rage boiled within him. His meticulously orchestrated plan had been all for naught, with others reaping the benefits of his hard work.

Not only had he lost the princess consort, but now the Blood Pill as well. Truly a case of losing both wife and soldiers.

The Zhenbei King popped his fragment into his mouth, crushing it between his teeth with visible fury, as if chewing Xu Qi’an himself.

“Master… these fragments, they’re all the essence of my Great Feng’s people,” Xu Qi’an hesitated, his instincts rejecting the idea of consuming them.

“I know a secret technique,” came Shenshu’s voice in his mind. “It burns the undying body to briefly reach peak power, but it requires vast amounts of blood essence as fuel. It’ll let you end this battle quickly.”

Xu Qi’an’s thoughts stirred. “Your peak when you were alive?”

After a moment of silence, Shenshu replied, “Not quite—but it will be more than enough against them... And I am not dead.”

Xu Qi’an gazed at the fragment in his hand, a phrase echoing in his mind: _The young man who slew dragons, finally became a demon._

Seeing his hesitation, Shenshu stopped speaking. Xu Qi’an swallowed the Blood Pill fragment.

“What power… No wonder this was forged from the lives of 380,000 people. Zhenbei King, why not share your method of refining Blood Pills with me? Together, we can slaughter cities and ascend to Rank Two, what do you think?”

Jili Zhigu stretched his body, his mood jubilant as he felt the immense energy coursing through him.

“Indeed!” Zhujiu sneered, speaking in human tongue. “We don’t know how to refine such pills. Random slaughter might nourish us, but it won’t yield these results. You, Zhenbei King, can secretly slaughter a city, but any more, and the Jianzheng will come for you. Let’s join forces and make a second, third pill together.”

The snake writhed as if its body itched, signaling its imminent shedding.

The warlock chuckled coldly. “It’s not over yet.”

The woman in the white dress glanced at Xu Qi’an and laughed softly. “This Regent will play along a little longer.”

The Daoist Leader’s avatar said nothing, having little use for the Blood Pill. He hadn’t consumed it, instead keeping it hidden. Being merely an avatar, he had already gained what he desired:

The evil of slaughtering a city.

No matter the outcome, he had profited and didn’t mind continuing the fight.

After consuming the Blood Pill, each combatant’s aura surged, brimming with confidence.

Their newfound strength reduced their fear of the Sovereign Sword.

The Zhenbei King tore off his armor, revealing his bronze-toned body.

“We have also reached the pinnacle of this life. Since the Blood Pill has been divided, your goals are achieved. Zhujiu, Jili Zhigu, let’s join forces to kill him first.”

Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu immediately turned to Xu Qi’an, wariness deep in their eyes.

The Zhenbei King had redirected their attention, sharing the burden of their focus.

It was an overt scheme.

This mysterious figure, capable of wielding the Sovereign Sword, had shown hostility toward them during the battle. Should the Zhenbei King fall, they knew this man’s next target would be them.

The Sovereign Sword’s presence was a real and lethal threat.

In contrast, the Zhenbei King had been rejected by the sword, making him a lesser danger.

Exchanging a glance, Zhujiu and Jili Zhigu grinned savagely. “Agreed.”
