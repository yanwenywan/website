# 382. The Curtain Rises (1)

The Imperial palace today had become a place of conflict, and no external officials were permitted to enter. The princes, princesses, and the imperial consorts within the palace naturally could not then summon outsiders.

*So, is Princess Huaiqing summoning me for something important?* Xu Qi’an promptly followed the head guard, mounted his beloved little mare, and rode towards Huaiqing Manor.

Huaiqing Manor was located in the highest and most heavily guarded section of the imperial city.

This area housed the residences of royal kin, including the estates of princes and princesses like Lin’an. It was second only to the imperial palace in significance.

*I am, after all, the lead investigator of the Chuzhou case. Although I’m not directly in the eye of the storm now, I am one of the principal figures involved. If Huaiqing is seeking me at this time, it’s certainly not because she misses me terribly…*

Truth be told, this was Xu Qi’an’s first visit to Huaiqing Manor. In contrast, he had frequented the Second Princess's residence many times. If it weren’t for the numerous spies and the impropriety of it, Xu Qi’an could have claimed a dedicated guest room at Lin’an’s estate.

The layout of Huaiqing Manor was similar to Lin’an Manor, but leaned towards a colder and more minimalist style. From the plants in the courtyard to the furnishings, there was a sense of serenity and simplicity.

In the spacious and well-lit reception hall, Xu Qi’an met Huaiqing, whom he hadn’t seen in a long while. This woman, as elegant as a snow lotus, was as composed and graceful as ever.

She wore a plain white palace gown overlaid with a light yellow gauze robe—simple yet not plain. Her jet-black hair was half loose and half tied into a bun, adorned with a jade hairpin and a gold ornamental *buyao*.

Her facial features were exquisitely beautiful and defined. Her eyebrows were long, straight, and delicate; her eyes were large, bright, and deep, resembling a tranquil autumn pool.

“Your Highness!”

Xu Qi’an cupped his fists in greeting. He initially intended to tease her about whether she liked the seal he had gifted her, but as he opened his mouth, he felt the levity inappropriate. Following Huaiqing’s gesture, he took a seat.

“Tell me the details of the Northern Border,” Huaiqing said with a calm expression. Her brows showed a trace of heaviness, as though she, too, lacked the mood for small talk.

Xu Qi’an proceeded to recount the events in Chuzhou in detail.

When he finished, Huaiqing remained silent for a long time. Her flawless face revealed no emotions, and in a soft voice, she said, “Take a walk with me in the courtyard.”

The rear garden of the princess’s residence was vast. The two walked side by side without speaking, yet the atmosphere was not awkward. Instead, they had a sense of tranquil harmony, like a reunion of old friends.

“Father was wrong. King Huai was first and foremost a king, and only secondarily a warrior. In life, the higher one’s position, the more one must prioritise the place they stand. That is the foundation of survival.”

After a long pause, Huaiqing sighed. “Therefore, King Huai deserved to die, even though the Great Feng has now lost a peak-level warrior because of it.”

*What about your father? Does he also deserve to die?*

Xu Qi’an replied softly, “Your Highness speaks with great righteousness.”

Huaiqing shook her head. Her serene and graceful face showed a trace of melancholy as she said gently, “What does this have to do with righteousness? It’s only that my blood hasn’t gone cold. I… am deeply disappointed in my father.”

Just as Xu Qi’an was about to respond, Huaiqing suddenly transmitted her voice to him, “Father’s refusal to leave the palace is not out of fear—it is a strategy.”

*Princess Huaiqing’s cultivation is profound. To transmit her voice, she must have reached the Refining Spirit realm. She’s been hiding her true abilities…* Xu Qi’an was startled and responded via voice transmission, “A strategy?”

Huaiqing nodded slowly and explained, “Have you noticed who among the civil officials besieging the palace gates in the past three days has left, who has come, and who is merely observing the spectacle?”

Xu Qi’an was taken aback.

Glancing at him, Huaiqing continued her transmission: “When the news of King Huai’s massacre reached the capital, whether they are corrupt officials or upright ones, whether they are genuinely furious or seeking fame, no scholar could remain indifferent. At such a time, public outrage is at its peak, like a surging tide. Thus, Father avoids the brunt and refuses to leave the palace.

“But waves crest once, weaken the second time, and subside the third. When the officials calm down, when some achieve their goal of making a name for themselves, and when dissenting voices emerge in the bureaucracy, that will be the time for Father to confront them. And that day will not be far off—I assure you, it will happen within three days.”

She then chuckled softly, a sound laced with mockery and disdain. “At present, rumours are rampant in the capital, and the people are filled with anger and anxiety. Every class is talking about it. At first glance, it seems like an unstoppable wave. However, Father’s real opponents are only those on the court, not the common rabble.”

Xu Qi’an furrowed his brows and said gravely, “But King Huai ultimately committed a massacre. His Majesty must provide an explanation to the officials and the people.”

Huaiqing sighed pessimistically. “Let Prime Minister Wang and Duke Wei deal their moves.”

Amidst the heavy atmosphere, Xu Qi’an changed the topic. “Your Highness once studied at Cloud Deer Academy. Have you ever heard of a book called _The Collected Records of the Great Zhou_?”

Huaiqing thought carefully, then shook her head. “I’ve never heard of it.”

…

That day, the indignant civil officials still failed to force their way into the imperial palace or meet Emperor Yuanjing. By dusk, they dispersed.

However, the officials did not give up and agreed to return the following day. If Emperor Yuanjing refused to provide an explanation, they would bring the court to a standstill.

That evening, as predicted, dissenting voices emerged in the bureaucracy.

Some, deeply worried, raised a question: “The news of the Zhenbei King’s massacre has spread far and wide. Where is the authority of the court? The common people must be utterly disillusioned with the royal family and the court, no?”

The Zhenbei King was the Emperor’s brother, a true royal, not just an ordinary noble.

He was also the Great Feng’s military god, and the guardian of the Northern Border in the hearts of the people.

Such a man massacred a city for his own gain!

The aftermath of this event is not just the loss of trust in the court—it is the disgrace of the royal family and the erosion of public faith.

Can a single statement, “The Zhenbei King has been executed,” truly erase the scars in the hearts of the people?

This was not the same as executing corrupt officials.

For over twenty years, Zhenbei King’s image has been that of a towering figure: a military god, the protector of the Northern Border, and a true prince.

How could this compare to a corrupt official? Executing corrupt officials only bolstered the authority of the court and the royal family.

But if the royal family itself committed such atrocities, will the people cheer as they do for the execution of corrupt officials? No, their faith will collapse. They will lose trust in the royal family and the court.

So, the Zhenbei King we once celebrated and admired is such a person.

It could even lead to more extreme reactions.

On the same day, there was an assassination attempt on the Crown Prince in the Eastern Palace.

That night, the palace gates were sealed, and the Imperial Guard searched the entire palace for the assassin but found nothing.

The following day, the gates of the capital were shut. Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen and Wei Yuan mobilised the capital’s five military divisions, the constabulary, and the Nightwatchers to search the entire city for the assassin.

House-to-house searches were conducted.

The entire capital was in chaos.

…

"The Crown Prince has nothing to do with this incident. Why was he suddenly targeted for assassination? Was it merely a coincidence, or is it part of the larger scheme? If it's the latter, then it’s truly tragic."

Early in the morning, upon hearing the news, Xu Qi’an immediately went to see Wei Yuan, but Wei Yuan refused to meet him.

Helpless, he instead headed to the courier station to discuss the matter with Zheng Xinghuai.

"Lord Zheng is out; he’s not at the station," said Li Han, who was carrying a horn bow on his back. He met Xu Qi’an at the entrance and said gravely:

"Recently, differing opinions have emerged in the official circles. Some claim that the Zhenbei King’s city massacre case is extremely delicate, involving the court’s prestige and the hearts of the people across the land, so it must be handled cautiously.

"Lord Zheng was furious and went out early this morning. I believe he went to lecture at the Imperial Academy."

*Those must be the old Emperor's pawns...* Xu Qi’an sighed, somewhat admiring Emperor Yuanjing. Despite being an unworthy ruler, he had played power politics for so many years and was far from dim-witted.

Together with Li Han, Xu Qi’an rode to the Imperial Academy.

From a distance, they saw Zheng Xinghuai standing outside the academy, speaking with great passion:

"The sage says: The people are of utmost importance, the monarch is of lesser importance...

"The Zhenbei King, as a noble King, massacred the people and treated them like livestock. He is the common enemy of all scholars...

"We scholars must strive to bring fortune to the people, establish virtue, merit, and principles. This is why I returned to the capital, vowing to seek justice for the 380,000 people of Chuzhou City..."

Does this approach work?

Of course, it does. Some newly rising Confucian scholars, before gaining nationwide recognition, often lectured at places like the Imperial Academy to spread their academic ideas.

If they won the approval of students and built a reputation, establishing a school of thought was not far off.

Zheng Xinghuai wasn’t spreading a philosophy; he was condemning the Zhenbei King and rallying students to join the critics.

The results were excellent. Scholars, especially young students filled with ambition and passion, were far purer than the seasoned officials in the bureaucracy.

Throughout history, most protests and demonstrations were led by young people.

"Is no one stopping him?" Xu Qi’an asked.

Li Han shook his head.

*That’s strange...* Xu Qi’an frowned slightly.

He waited patiently by the roadside until Zheng Xinghuai, having vented his anger, left with his bodyguards, including Shentu Baili. Xu Qi’an then stepped forward to meet him.

"This is no place to talk. Silver Gong Xu, come back to the courier station with me," Zheng Xinghuai said solemnly, with a slight nod.

Back at the courier station, Zheng Xinghuai led Xu Qi’an to the study. After Li Han served tea, the official, who had experienced significant ups and downs in his life, looked at Xu Qi’an and said:

"Is this about today’s rumours in the officialdom?"

"That’s part of it. The rumours may have been spread by him, but they’re not without reason and must be guarded against." Xu Qi’an sighed and added, "Primarily, I’m here regarding the Crown Prince’s assassination attempt."

Zheng Xinghuai pondered for a moment before asking, "Who has been the most active in this matter?"

Xu Qi’an was taken aback. "Duke Wei and the Prime Minister."

Sitting upright, Zheng Xinghuai nodded and said, "This is most likely a scheme orchestrated by Duke Wei and the Prime Minister. As for their purpose, I cannot say."

*What? Duke Wei and the Prime Minister plotted to assassinate the Crown Prince?*

*Why? What does the Crown Prince have to do with this case...?* Xu Qi’an could not imagine such an answer.

After much discussion, Zheng Xinghuai glanced at the water clock in the room and said gravely, "I must visit old acquaintances in the capital and make my rounds. I’ll take my leave now, Silver Gong Xu."

Xu Qi’an rose to his feet, and as he reached the threshold, Zheng Xinghuai’s voice came from behind: "Silver Gong Xu..."

He turned around.

The ageing scholar, whose back was slowly hunching, smoothed his greying hair and bowed deeply.

"A young man’s promise is worth a thousand tons of gold. I have always admired Silver Gong Xu’s half-poem. That day, atop the city walls, I promised the 380,000 dead souls of Chuzhou to seek justice for them. Since I made that vow, I have no regrets.

"After this matter is resolved, I shall resign and return home. In this life, I fear we may not meet again. Thus, this official thanks you in advance."

Xu Qi’an straightened his face and returned the bow with utmost seriousness.

He opened the door and stepped over the threshold. A few steps away, Zheng Xinghuai’s voice recited from the room:

"*A young man’s valour, brings heroes from five capitals old. With loyal heart, with just hand. With words of iron, life or death, A promise is worth a thousand tons of gold...*"

*The tumult of the world is endless, yet to achieve merit and retreat, leaving behind a life of leisurely freedom and pastoral serenity, would be quite ideal...* Xu Qi’an chuckled.

...

The Imperial Palace.

Emperor Yuanjing sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, his eyes half-closed. "Have they caught the assassin yet?" he asked indifferently.

The elderly eunuch shook his head and replied respectfully, "No news yet."

"If they can’t catch him, then there’s no need to," Emperor Yuanjing said.

He opened his eyes, a sharp yet contemplative smile on his lips. "In this court, only Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen are interesting. The others fall short."

The elderly eunuch kept his head lowered, refraining from comment.

Emperor Yuanjing continued, "Send people out of the palace to deliver messages to those on the list. There’s no need to be discreet, but don’t be too blatant either."

After a pause, he added, "Notify the cabinet. Tomorrow, in the Imperial Study, we shall convene the court to discuss the Zhenbei King’s city massacre case."

The elderly eunuch’s breath quickened slightly. "Yes Your Majesty!" he replied.
