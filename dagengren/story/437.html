# 437. Each Side

The entire venue was so silent one could hear a pin drop. After a few heartbeats, a tremendous shock and confusion exploded in everyone’s hearts, followed by a wave of frenzied discussion.

This uproar far surpassed any that had come before.

*The military treatise that had subdued the arrogant and domineering Peiman Xilou, that had made the great scholar Zhang Shen slap the table in praise, turned out not to be written by Xu Xinnian, but by that almost taboo name…*

*The former Silver Gong, Xu Qi’an?*

“A treatise written by Silver Gong Xu? How is that possible… he’s not even a scholar.”

“Xu Qi’an, he’s just a martial man…”

Though Xu Qi’an was no longer an official, everyone still habitually referred to him as Silver Gong Xu.

The Imperial Academy students erupted like a boiling pot. Everyone was talking at once, voicing their views and opinions, ignoring the decorum of the occasion.

Most found it absurd, impossible to believe. It wasn’t that they looked down on Xu Qi’an, but the matter itself seemed completely illogical, shocking, bewildering, beyond comprehension.

At that moment, a student of the Imperial Academy loudly said:

“Don’t forget, Silver Gong Xu is the foremost poet. Back then, who could have imagined he’d compose poem after brilliant poem destined to be classics?”

His words immediately resonated with the students, who shouted in agreement, trying to persuade those still in disbelief:

“Silver Gong Xu isn’t a scholar, yet he could write poetry, so why couldn’t he write on military strategy? Besides, have you forgotten? Silver Gong Xu has been to war. In Yunzhou, he single-handedly held off eight thousand rebels and died of exhaustion.”

At that, the other students suddenly realised the truth. Yes, Xu Qi’an wasn’t a novice to the battlefield. In Yunzhou, he had indeed faced thousands of rebels alone.

“Silver Gong Xu is truly a rare genius.”

“Exactly. The fact he isn’t a scholar only proves his brilliance, a talent scarcely seen in the world.”

“Damn it, why did someone like him take the martial path… That Xu… an unworthy father.”

In an instant, praise for Xu Qi’an flooded in from the Imperial Academy students.

One student, long stifled, even loudly challenged:

“Peiman Xilou? You claimed to be self-taught? What a coincidence, our Silver Gong Xu is also self-taught. You’ve talent, no doubt. But there’s always a higher peak. Xu Qi’an of the Great Feng? He’s a mountain you’ll never cross.”

The crowd immediately echoed him.

Peiman Xilou wore a blank expression, speechless.

The boy with vertical pupils clenched his fists, facial muscles twitching, as if he wanted to go on a killing spree but was barely restraining himself.

He was on the verge of madness. The situation had clearly been in their favour, everything was going according to Big Brother Peiman plan. Apart from a few revered scholars who wouldn’t take the field, no contemporary scholar could stand against him.

Yet the unseen figure Xu Qi’an, only known by name, had foiled the plan and rendered all their efforts worthless.

Huang Xian’er bit her lip, her soft, seductive gaze flickering, pondering something inscrutable.

*So the treatise was written by his elder brother? For Xu Dalang to entrust such a masterpiece to him, the bond between the brothers is deeper than I thought…* After her initial shock, Wang Simu did not feel disappointed. Instead, she was both touched and comforted by the closeness between the two.

On his own, Xu Erlang might appear slightly lacking in her father’s eyes. But if he had a brother as capable as Xu Qi’an behind him, her father would not take him lightly.

At that thought, she quietly glanced at her father. Sure enough, Wang Shoufu was watching Xu Erlang intently.

Wang Simu felt secretly pleased. What’s more, after today’s literary meet, Xu Erlang’s reputation would rise dramatically.

For a fleeting moment, Huaiqing couldn’t help but want to turn her head to glance at a certain guard behind her, but she restrained the impulse, stiffened her neck, and remained seated.

Her curiosity grew stronger. He understood military strategy? Wrote a treatise? Since meeting him, he had never voiced any opinion on such matters. *Was the book written by Duke Wei, using him to pass it to Xu Erlang?*

The clever eldest princess deduced further, she suspected the treatise had been written by Wei Yuan.

Huaiqing pursed her lips, eyes falling on the military treatise in Zhang Shen’s hands. Her cool gaze, usually as calm as autumn water, now burned with an uncharacteristic thirst for knowledge.

*So it was that Running Dog who wrote it…* Biaobiao’s smile bloomed like a flower, her goose-egg face radiantly charming. Xu Erlang was in the spotlight, and she felt a sense of justice. Someone had finally put that arrogant savage in his place. Beyond that, she had little emotional reaction.

Upon learning that Xu Qi’an had written the treatise, Biaobiao’s spirits soared. She was brimming with pride and joy. Were it not for the inappropriate setting, she’d have bounced around like a chattering sparrow, pestering Xu Qi’an.

The Grand Tutor smiled with satisfaction, his old face beaming. “The Great Feng truly is a land of talent. We still have juniors who can amaze us.”

Then, looking at the statue-like Zhang Shen, he said in a deep voice, “Zhang Jinyan, let this old man see the book.”

Zhang Shen snapped out of his daze and passed the treatise over the air.

The Grand Tutor leaned on his staff, turned back and sat at the desk. Squinting through his slightly dimmed old eyes, he began to read.

Not even ten minutes later, having only read the first two chapters, the Grand Tutor suddenly snapped the book shut with a loud “pat”. His hands trembled slightly with excitement as he spoke in a grave voice:

“This book must not circulate. The barbarians must not be allowed to copy it. This is the military treatise of the Great Feng. It must never be passed beyond our borders.”

*Uh…*

The titled nobles, military commanders, Imperial Academy students, Hanlin Academy prodigies, and of course, Huaiqing and others, all stared at the treatise in the Grand Tutor’s hands with increasing longing and desire.

…

A young eunuch came dashing to the palace gates, eyes sparkling with excitement. Unlike usual, he didn’t bow his head, but kept peering eagerly inside, clearly impatient and thrilled.

The old eunuch glanced nervously at Emperor Yuanjing, who was sitting in meditation, and quietly withdrew to the entrance. Frowning, he asked, “What is it?”

The young eunuch whispered a few words into his ear.

The old eunuch’s eyes suddenly widened, his expression extremely complex. He lowered his head and returned to Emperor Yuanjing’s side, saying softly, “Your Majesty, this old servant… this old servant has something to report.”

The emperor did not open his eyes, merely replied with a disinterested “Mm.”

“There has been a development at the literary meet. After Zhang Shen conceded, Hanlin Academy’s Xu Xinnian stepped forward to debate military strategy with Peiman Xilou…”

The emperor opened his eyes.

The old eunuch continued, “Peiman Xilou conceded defeat.”

The emperor showed clear surprise, and after a few seconds of silence, spoke in a measured tone:

“That Xu Xinnian is Zhang Shen’s student, specialising in military strategy. I hadn’t expected such mastery. Impressive. Though he’s Xu Qi’an’s cousin, he’s also a Hanlin bachelor. Him besting Peiman Xilou is acceptable.”

Xu Qi’an had resigned of his own accord, but the emperor had followed up by stripping him of title and office, expelling him from court.

Xu Xinnian was that bastard’s cousin. If he won against Peiman Xilou, the public would inevitably bring up the equally gifted Xu Qi’an and accuse the emperor of “persecuting the loyal and virtuous.”

That was the only downside.

Still, Xu Xinnian’s status as a Hanlin bachelor was personally appointed by the emperor, and his talents had been recognised by the emperor himself. So it wasn’t a major problem.

All in all, Emperor Yuanjing was rather pleased. Compared to a few rumours, losing to Peiman Xilou would have been the true disgrace.

If the court lost face, then so did the emperor.

And for an emperor, two things mattered above all: power and image.

The gloom between Emperor Yuanjing’s brows lifted, and a faint smile appeared on his face as he said, “Tell Us the full process. We want to know how he defeated Peiman Xilou.”

The old eunuch hesitated, then quietly took a few steps back before lowering his head and saying, “The presented scholar Xu Xinnian took out a military treatise. After Peiman Xilou read it, he was utterly convinced and willingly admitted defeat.”

“A military treatise?”

This was unexpected. Emperor Yuanjing said in surprise, “What treatise?”

Even Zhang Shen of Cloud Deer Academy had admitted that his _Six Treatises on the Art of War_ was inferior to Peiman Xilou’s. As for the military works compiled by the Hanlin Academy, they were nothing more than old ideas in new packaging.

The old eunuch swallowed. “The treatise is called _The Art of War_ by Sun Tzu. It—it was… written by Xu Qi’an.”

After he finished, he heard the sound of hurried breathing from within the sleeping chambers.

Even without looking up, he could imagine just how unsightly the Emperor’s expression must be at this moment.

A few seconds later, Emperor Yuanjing’s voice came, devoid of emotion: “Leave!”

The old eunuch felt a wave of relief, lowered his head, and fled the palace as though escaping. Behind him, the sounds of shattered crockery and vases echoed.

*The court hasn’t been humiliated, but this time His Majesty, really really has…* The old eunuch let out a sigh.

One could only imagine how the entire capital would gossip. The Emperor had persecuted the loyal and virtuous out of selfishness. The proud scholars of the capital had been thoroughly outdone by a barbarian. And in the end, it was that very man, expelled from officialdom by imperial decree, who had turned the tide.

A sovereign had become a laughingstock. No wonder His Majesty had flown into a rage.

…

The literary gathering had ended, but the military treatise had not been returned to Xu Xinnian. It was forcibly seized and retained by the Grand Tutor.

The noblemen, military officials, and the attending scholars were deeply dissatisfied, but none dared openly oppose this venerable figure of the scholarly world.

Even Huaiqing did not dare. She left with some displeasure, leading her guards straight to her residence.

The various parties dispersed. As for the Yao and barbarians, Peiman Xilou looked somewhat solemn, Huang Xian’er had shed her seductive manner, her pretty face cold as frost.

And the vertical-pupiled youth with his impulsive, violent temper, nothing needed to be said.

Once the three boarded the carriage, no one spoke. The atmosphere was suffocating, until Huang Xian’er finally broke the silence:

“Do you have any other plans?”

Peiman Xilou’s expression remained blank. After a few seconds of thought, he said lightly:

“Though I lost at the gathering and my reputation has taken quite a hit, the officials of Great Feng won’t disregard me because of this. The impact is still there, but for the fact that Silver Gong Xu’s interference has ruined all subsequent plans.”

He let out a long sigh. “That man is staggeringly talented. I must admit it. Before, I admired his poetry, his natural gifts, envied his renown. But after today, I feel genuine apprehension toward him—even fear.

“Thank goodness he and the Emperor of Great Feng are at odds. No, thank goodness they are mortal enemies. Otherwise, should he ever command the military, our divine race would be in grave danger.”

Huang Xian’er smiled sweetly. “I thought the same. That’s why I’m planning to send him a few beauties with outstanding looks.”

Peiman Xilou shook his head. “You think he lacks women?”

Huang Xian’er sighed softly, casually revealing her long legs and gently brushing her chest with one hand. She said coyly, “Then I’ll go myself. That’ll work, won’t it?”

Peiman Xilou finally smiled. “I was waiting for you to say that.”

After a pause, he said, “There’s no rush. These next few days, we continue to make the rounds and try to win over as many Great Feng officials as possible. Recover whatever losses we can. Once the negotiations end, we’ll pay this legendary figure a visit. Xuanyin, you’re not going.”

The vertical-pupiled youth was indignant. “Why not?”

Peiman Xilou sneered, “Xu Qi’an is a wholesale martial man. You speak without thinking. If you provoke him, he might very well strike you down on the spot.”

The youth widened his eyes. “He wouldn’t dare! We’re an envoy. If he kills a diplomatic envoy, the Great Feng court won’t spare him.”

Killing an envoy meant breaking off diplomatic relations. And given the current alliance against the Church of the Warlock God, the Great Feng court wouldn’t allow such a thing.

Huang Xian’er poked the boy’s forehead and said with a smile, “He even dared kill dukes. If you’re not afraid of dying, we won’t stop you. Think about your worth.

“Lord Zhujiu sent you here to be tempered; he has hopes for you. But if you die here, His Excellency won’t care.”

The Yao race had always been ruthless in how they trained their juniors, and snakes were cold-blooded above all.

If you survived and grew stronger, you’d be nurtured. If you died, it simply meant you weren’t good enough.

The law of the jungle.

…

Huaiqing’s residence.

Upon returning, Huaiqing dismissed the palace maids and guards, leaving only Biaobiao and Xu Qi’an in the parlour.

“So it was you. I couldn’t find you at all earlier. If you hadn’t entered the tent, I wouldn’t have dared confirm your identity.”

Biaobiao cheerfully dragged Xu Qi’an to sit beside her.

_Princess, we shouldn’t be sitting together. This really breaks decorum… And by the way, in my previous life this face of mine stunned the whole party, how did you not recognise me at first? Your face blindness is truly a problem._

Just as Xu Qi’an had this thought, Biaobiao looked at him admiringly and said, “You’re so clever, disguising yourself as such an utterly forgettable man. Just one glance and you’d be forgotten. No one would notice.”

Xu Qi’an gave her a blank look and silently moved to another table.

Biaobiao widened her watery peach blossom eyes, looking utterly wronged.

“The treatise was written by Duke Wei. You used it to suppress Peiman Xilou?” Huaiqing asked, sipping her tea and glancing at her increasingly emotional and foolish younger sister.

“That’s right!”

Xu Qi’an smiled and nodded.

Huaiqing gave a slight nod. That made sense. In this world, only Wei Yuan could write a military treatise that could convince Peiman Xilou, impress Zhang Shen, and stir the Grand Tutor so deeply.

_So the treatise was written by Wei Yuan…_ Biaobiao looked a little disappointed. In her mind, her Running Dog was omnipotent.

“You probably don’t remember what was written in it, do you?” Huaiqing asked.

“Nope.” Xu Qi’an shook his head.

Huaiqing gave a small sigh. Although she would eventually get to read the treatise, as a lover of books, she hated the wait.

_Never mind. I’ll go see Duke Wei later…_ Huaiqing thought to herself.

After a few more casual remarks, Xu Qi’an took his leave.

Biaobiao followed him out. As they exited the residence, she stared intently at Xu Qi’an. “That treatise… was it really written by Wei Yuan?”
