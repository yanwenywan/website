# 376. Game Analysis

*Upon learning of the "Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles" case in the Northern Territories, this poor Daoist was struck by inspiration and assumed the identity of Lady Flying Swallow, secretly travelling to Chuzhou. After enduring countless hardships, I finally located Zheng Xinghuai, the Provincial Administrator who had miraculously survived the massacre.*

*Who could have expected that, at that very moment, the Zhenbei King's spies would arrive with troops, intending to silence both this humble Daoist and Zheng Xinghuai? It turned out they had been tracking us in secret, lying in wait for an opportune moment.*

*However, they met with fierce resistance from this poor Daoist. Like Xu Ningyan in Yunzhou, I held my ground against overwhelming odds, eventually driving back the Zhenbei King's spies. It was then that I learned from Zheng Xinghuai the full details of the city's massacre.*

*This train of thought elevated this poor Daoist to the tenth level!*

Such was Li Miaozhen's internal monologue, and she very much wanted to voice these thoughts. However, recalling Xu Qi’an’s lone stand against tens of thousands of rebels and the shameful moment during the Yunzhou case when, in a moment of hubris, she had boasted to him, “This general is naturally skilled at solving cases,” she resisted the urge to boast.

As someone utterly devoted to the art of deduction and unravelling mysteries, Li Miaozhen suppressed her desire to flaunt her accomplishments and instead truthfully replied, “All of this is actually thanks to Silver Gong Xu.”

*Silver Gong Xu?!*

The members of the delegation froze, bewildered by the sudden mention of Xu Qi’an.

Li Miaozhen explained, “It was Xu Qi’an who invited me to Chuzhou to investigate this case.”

*Ah, so that’s it…* The High Court Deputy Justice stroked his beard, nodding with a smile.

“Daoist Li is truly a remarkable individual. Although the Daoist Heaven Sect unity with nature and non-action, your disdain for fame and fortune does not diminish the significance of your contributions. You do not need to attribute all credit to Silver Gong Xu.”

Censor Liu, upon hearing this, chimed in, “The delegation will certainly report the details to the court and petition for rewards on your behalf.”

While Xu Qi’an might have invited the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect to assist with the investigation, her efforts in Chuzhou were undeniably her own achievements.

*Scholars are always so eloquent…* Li Miaozhen felt both pleased and a touch abashed. She then continued, “After arriving in Chuzhou, I travelled widely, seeking clues, but found nothing…”

The delegation listened intently, understanding the difficulty of the case and eagerly anticipating how Li Miaozhen had discovered the breakthrough that led to the truth of the massacre.

“But every event leaves traces,” she continued. “The corpse that exposed the ‘Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles’ case was found on a mountain path outside the capital. A commoner with no evidence to support his claims would never have dared to bring such accusations to the capital. Clearly, someone was aiding him from behind the scenes. That person did not use official documents or reports but relied on Jianghu messengers. I reasoned they would use the same method again.

“Thus, I assumed the identity of Lady Flying Swallow in Chuzhou, slaying barbarians, punishing corrupt merchants, and distributing porridge to the poor. This poor Daoist has earned some renown in the martial world; many recognise me, and even more know of me…

“As expected, it wasn’t long before someone sought me out in secret, asking for my help.”

*Brilliant!*

The members of the delegation were utterly convinced, their admiration pouring forth as they exclaimed, “Daoist Li’s mind is as sharp as a blade! To think of investigating from this angle—it is truly extraordinary. We are deeply impressed.”

Chief Constable Chen, feeling ashamed, added, “I’ve worked in the constabulary for so many years to no avail. This is truly humbling.”

Censor Liu was full of praise: “I had thought the resolution of this case would ultimately depend on Silver Gong Xu, but Daoist Li has proven herself far superior.”

The civil officials did not hold back their compliments, half out of genuine admiration and half out of the habitual politeness cultivated in court.

Hearing such words, Li Miaozhen couldn’t help but let a small, smug smile slip through. Quickly regaining her composure, she cleared her throat and said, “This poor Daoist is not being modest; in truth, all of this was taught to me by Xu Ningyan. We have remained in contact throughout.”

The laughter and praise abruptly halted, as if someone had pressed pause. The members of the delegation froze, their expressions stiff as they stared blankly at the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect.

*Why did Li Miaozhen save the most crucial piece of information for the very end?*

*Was this some sort of peculiar sense of humour?*

*This is a little awkward…*

*So, Xu Qi’an had departed from the delegation mid-journey, secretly heading to the Northern Territories because, from the very beginning, he had already arranged for assistance. When His Majesty and the cabinet ministers appointed him to lead the investigation, he must have already devised a detailed plan…* Chief Constable Chen felt a profound sense of Xu Qi’an’s cunning.

The repeated setbacks suffered by Minister Sun at Xu Qi’an’s hands, driving him to madness, were now perfectly understandable.

*It was an oversight on my part. From the tax silver case to the Sangpo case, the Yunzhou case, and later the case of the imperial consort, every single incident has demonstrated Xu Qi’an’s wealth of experience and meticulous thinking. To underestimate him is a grave mistake…* The High Court Deputy Justice smiled wryly and shook his head.

*So this was all part of Silver Gong Xu’s plan from the start. How naive of me to think otherwise.*

*No wonder he is referred to as Sir Xu…* Centurion Chen Xiao’s spirit lifted, a look of admiration on his face.

The imperial guards also smiled, feeling a sense of shared pride.

Yang Yan gave a slight nod, as if he had expected no less—it seemed only natural to him.

Li Miaozhen then informed the delegation of Zheng Xinghuai’s survival, which greatly excited Censor Liu. Not only did they now have a key witness, but Censor Liu also had a personal connection with Zheng Xinghuai and was genuinely overjoyed to learn he was still alive.

“Xu Ningyan is probably still on his way to Chuzhou City. My sword is much faster than his,” Li Miaozhen remarked, before asking, “What of the mysterious expert? Where has he gone?”

Yang Yan thought for a moment before his expression changed abruptly. “He headed in the same direction as the fleeing barbarians.”

The High Court Deputy Justice’s heart skipped a beat as a wild thought flashed through his mind. His breathing grew rapid. “Could it be… could it be…”

Censor Liu was quick to catch on. “Could it be he has gone to pursue Jili Zhigu? He fears the power imbalance in the Northern Territories, that after this battle, the people of Chuzhou will be left defenceless against barbarian raids.”

Yang Yan and Li Miaozhen exchanged glances and spoke in unison: “Let us go and see.”

The latter added, “Hop on.”

Yang Yan leapt lightly onto the spine of the sword, standing with his hands behind his back.

A fourth-rank martial artist could fly, but their speed, altitude, and stamina paled in comparison to the Daoist art of sword flight. To draw a comparison, it would be like comparing a motorbike to a high-speed train.

If one were to imagine a race between a martial artist running across the ground and a Daoist soaring through the skies, the martial artist might gain the upper hand—provided the terrain was an open plain with no mountains or rivers to impede their progress.

Flying north for half an hour, Li Miaozhen and Yang Yan spotted Jili Zhigu. He was not hard to find, as he stood directly on the main road.

This leader of the Qingyan Tribe, once the strongest barbarian warrior after the Battle of Shanhai Pass, was now but a withered husk.

His head had been torn off and cast aside on the roadside, still attached to a portion of his spine.

Li Miaozhen hovered in mid-air, gazing down at the scene, and murmured, “In this battle in the North, two third-rank martial artists have fallen. This news will undoubtedly spread across Jiuzhou and cause an uproar.”

Yang Yan was momentarily dazed. The realm he had longed to reach now seemed, in the eyes of higher-ranking experts, to amount to nothing more than this.

Third rank… No matter the system or faction, such individuals were leaders in their own right.

Yang Yan dismounted from the sword, picked up the spine, and hoisted the Qingyan leader’s head. Then, he carried it back to Chuzhou City.

When he hung the head on the city walls, twenty thousand soldiers silently gazed upward, tears streaming down their faces.

The barbarian warrior who had terrorised Chuzhou for twenty years was finally dead.

At the same time, a question lingered in everyone’s mind: who was the mysterious expert responsible for this?

…

Hundreds of miles from Chuzhou City, by the edge of a serene pool, Xu Qi’an lay weakly on a large, smooth rock worn down by the flow of water, having just bathed.

After successively seizing the life essence of the Zhenbei King and Jili Zhigu, Shenshu had fallen into a deep slumber—this time, likely beyond waking. Unless, of course, fortune smiled upon him once again, as it had in the ancient tomb, allowing him to leech another wave of fortune.

Without the muscle-bound monk to rely on, a sudden sense of insecurity crept over him... Xu Qi’an examined his body carefully and noticed that after Shenshu had revealed his pitch-black Dharma aspect, his physical strength had grown yet again.

It was akin to a flood expanding the width of a river channel. Though the floodwaters had receded, the mark they left behind was indelible.

*No wonder Lu Shuren said, "We express gratitude to those who dig tunnels, but we reserve the highest respect for those who expand them."* Xu Qi’an found himself with a deeper understanding of this sentiment.

*After this battle, my comprehension of Transforming Force has deepened. Personally experiencing the combat and power utilisation of high-rank martial artists is an invaluable experience for someone like me...*

Forcing himself to muster some energy, Xu Qi’an sat cross-legged and began to meditate, reviewing the case of “Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles” out of habit.

*The Zhenbei King's objectives in the massacre were twofold: first, to refine the Blood Pill and break through to third rank completion, and then absorb the Princess Consort's spiritual essence to officially ascend to Rank Two. Second, to set a trap and hunt down Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu.*

*The appearance of the Sovereign Sword indicates that Emperor Yuanjing was fully aware of the Zhenbei King's massacre and might even have been complicit. Otherwise, the Sovereign Sword would never have shown up in Chuzhou.*

When the Sovereign Sword appeared, Xu Qi’an had been both shocked and furious. But at the time, with a great enemy before him, he hadn't had the luxury to dwell on it.

"That dog Emperor Yuanjing..." Xu Qi’an exhaled deeply, forcing himself to calm down.

*If the dog Emperor knew about the massacre, it clears up a mystery—the heroic figure who died outside the capital must have been taken out by agents of Emperor Yuanjing. Only he could have laid such a comprehensive trap around the capital, identifying and neutralising the target.*

*This also explains why I was appointed as the chief officer of the case rather than a governor being dispatched. The mission was only ever meant to be perfunctory, so there was no need to assign a governor with substantial power to counterbalance the Zhenbei King. And when the situation became dire, the Zhenbei King could simply silence everyone.*

*Moreover, the delegation's role included escorting the Princess Consort to the north. The dog Emperor may be inhumane, but he's still a sly old fox. However, I can't shake the feeling that he trusted and indulged the Zhenbei King far too much.*

Xu Qi’an paused for a moment, then continued along this train of thought:

*If Yuanjing knew the truth of the massacre, did Duke Wei also know? Judging by the response of his remnant soul, he shouldn't have... But then again, with a LYB like Duke Wei, his displayed reaction might not be genuine—it could be what he wanted me to see.*

*Assuming Duke Wei was aware of the massacre, how would he have responded? With his character, there's no way he would tolerate such an atrocity, even if it meant the Great Feng gaining a Rank Two martial artist.*

*But so far, I haven't seen any sign of Duke Wei's involvement in this matter. Hmm... if I reverse the logic, if Duke Wei did know about this, how could he stop the Zhenbei King?*

*The Zhenbei King is a Rank Three martial artist, the strongest in the Great Feng. How could he be stopped? There's no one in the Nightwatchers capable of dealing with him. Otherwise, it wouldn't have fallen to me to thwart his plans just now.*

*Then how would one stop the Zhenbei King?*

A flash of inspiration struck Xu Qi’an's mind—_Drive the tiger to devour the wolf._

*In the northern regions, the only ones capable of disrupting the Zhenbei King's plans were Jili Zhigu and Zhujiu. If it were me, I would have leaked the location of the massacre to his enemies.*

*But how did Duke Wei know the massacre would take place in Chuzhou?* Xu Qi’an frowned, recalling a puzzling detail.

Before departing the capital, Wei Yuan had told him that due to the redeployment of informants to the northeast, intelligence from the north was delayed, leaving him in the dark about the _Blood Runs Three **Thousand** Miles_ case.

*With Duke Wei's intelligence, even if he withdrew his informants, he wouldn't have left the north entirely blind. He would have kept a few spies in key cities. Otherwise, he wouldn't be the Azure Cloak Wei I know.*

This was yet another piece of circumstantial evidence suggesting Wei Yuan had been hiding something.

Building on this line of thought, Xu Qi’an began to piece together a clearer picture:

*Duke Wei specifically sought me out and asked how I planned to investigate the case. I told him I intended to break away from the delegation and head north alone.*

*Then he gave me a way to contact Cai'er. The moment I met her, she provided crucial intelligence about Xikou County. Everything happened far too smoothly.*

*Furthermore, Xikou County and Chuzhou are in opposite directions. Was this Duke Wei's way of sending me on a wild goose chase, to keep me out of this affair?*

*If that's the case, then he must have a thorough understanding of the situation in the north.*

For a moment, Xu Qi’an felt a chill run down his spine, his feelings complicated—a mix of gratitude and an instinctive wariness towards LYBs.

*When I pick up the Princess Consort and rejoin the delegation, I’ll make a stop at Sanhuang county.*

...

The following morning, Xu Qi’an, sporting the devastatingly handsome visage of his past life—capable of provoking outrage amongst cliques and shaming even the most dashing stars—strode into the inn and knocked on the Princess Consort’s door.
