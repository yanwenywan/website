# 348. Ambush

Xu Qi’an found himself both surprised and unsurprised by this conjecture.

What caused him surprise was that he had always regarded the Zhenbei Princess Consort as a glorified vase—a peerless beauty, yet fundamentally a mere woman who shouldn’t be entangled in any matters of secrecy.

What didn’t cause surprise was noticing that Chu Xianglong had brought women on board. After hearing from Yang Yan that the Princess Consort was accompanying them, he had already made mental preparations.

*Since there’s a chance of danger, I must take precautions and proceed cautiously... But no rush for now—I have my own matters to attend to.*

Xu Qi’an picked up the cloth bag, laid out the eight pieces of butter jade on the table, and took out his carving knife to begin carving.

…

After eating her fill, the old auntie lay down on the bed for a nap. Her light sleep was soon interrupted by the noisy shouting and commotion from the pier.

Irritated, she thumped her pillow a few times before getting up to tidy the dishes and pack them into the food container. She carried it out of the room and went downstairs to the second floor.

Walking along the corridor, she looked left and right at the rooms, knowing that this floor was occupied by Nightwatchers and officials from the Three Departments.

She wasn’t sure which room Xu Qi’an was staying in, but it didn’t take her long to locate the room of the notorious lecher Xu Ningyan; his door was wide open.

Inside, the now remarkably refined young man was sitting at his table, meticulously carving pieces of butter jade.

"Knock, knock."

She rapped on the door. When he looked up, she stiffly said, "Here’s your food container. Th-thank you..."

Clearly not adept at expressing gratitude, her awkwardness showed in her rigid demeanour.

"Just leave it by the door," Xu Qi’an replied nonchalantly, lowering his head to continue his work.

The old auntie stepped into the room, set the container down carefully, and glanced at the table. There lay several finished carvings: a miniature sword, two jade buns, an octagonal talisman, a seal, and a jade pendant.

Curious, she asked, "What are you carving these for? The workmanship’s rather crude."

She chuckled to herself, as if amused by her own quip.

"They’re gifts for women," Xu Qi’an replied.

*Gifts for women?* She stared at the carvings on the table, her smile gradually fading.

"Whenever I travel outside the capital, I send local specialties to the women who fancy me, along with a handwritten letter. It’s inexpensive, yet it pleases them and makes them like me even more."

Xu Qi’an spoke with righteous conviction, detailing his well-honed skills in managing relationships.

The old auntie shot him a look of pure disdain, as if staring at the scum of the earth. "You truly are a despicable man," she sneered.

Xu Qi’an retorted, "Too bad there’s nothing here for you."

"Hmph, as if I care." She stormed out, seething with anger.

Before long, all the jade carvings were complete, imbued with meaning and purpose by Xu Qi’an.

He carefully set aside the miniature sword for safekeeping in the fragment of the Earth Book. This one was for Li Miaozhen and didn’t need to be mailed—he would deliver it in person when they reunited in the North.

Unrolling a sheet of prepared letter paper, Xu Qi’an dipped his brush into ink and began to write.

*Five days from the capital, we have arrived in Huangyou county. This place is famed for its butter jade, a soft and shiny stone, that is warm to the touch. I became quite fond of it, so I bought some raw pieces and carved Your Highness a seal.*

*The seal says: When you smile, the evening glow blankets heaven.*

This was for Huaiqing. He put the letter and the seal into the envelope.

The second letter was for Biaobiao:

*Five days from the capital, we have arrived in Huangyou county. This place is famed for its butter jade, a soft and shiny stone, that is warm to the touch. I became quite fond of it, so I bought some raw pieces and carved Your Highness a pendant.*

*I am a hopelessly coarse and worldly man; mountains are just mountains, seas are just seas, flowers are just flowers, but when I see you, only four words come to mind: for a thousand lifetimes.* 

He placed the jade pendant into the envelope.

The third and fourth letters were for Caiwei and Lina, with nearly identical contents:

*Five days from the capital, we have arrived in Huangyou county… In the vast world, there are countless delicacies. I heard that there is a country far beyond the seas, where there is a heavenly treat known as “Hujianese”.[^1] In the future, if we have an opportunity, I’ll take you looking for it to the ends of the sky.*

He tucked the jade buns into their respective envelopes.

The fifth message was for Zhong Li:

*Five days from the capital, we have arrived in Huangyou county… While I’m away from the capital, stay safe underneath the Sitianjian. Believe that the hard days will pass — just a bit more bitterness, just a bit more pain, one day flowers will bloom from your suffering.*

*When that day comes, be my princess, and you’ll only need to eat \*\*\*\* and not bitter fruit.*

The octagonal talisman went into her envelope.

The sixth letter was for Lingyue:

*Five days from the capital, we have arrived in Huangyou county… Your brother is safe and sound, though a bit homesick, missing my gentle and lovely little sister. When big brother comes home from this trip, I’ll get you some more jewellery. In your brother’s heart, Lingyue you are the most special, no one could replace you.*

The seventh letter was for Fuxiang:

*Some great Confucian once said: to find one true confidant in life, then that life has no regrets. Miss fuxiang is that confidant of mine, I hope our bond lasts as long as heaven and earth, more permanent than gold.*

*“Please let me freeload as long as heaven and earth…”*

Every fish needed different words, to fully express his care and affection for them, to make them feel that they are the most important. Nothing could be brushed over.

This was the essential work of a king of fishes. 

With everything ready, Xu Qi’an stretched, feeling a great weight come off his shoulders. Looking at the seven letters on his table, he felt a deep sense of accomplishment.

Last time on the border of Qingzhou, he also wrote seven letters, but two of those were filler letters addressed to his uncle and auntie. Now though, all seven were for women. Put Li Miaozhen on top, that makes eight.

Xu Qi’an celebrated the growth of his "fishpond" enterprise with pride.

…

Satisfied, he secured the letters and set out for Yang Yan’s room. "Boss, I have something to discuss with everyone. Can we meet here?"

Yang Yan, who was just sat cross-legged in meditation, frowned at the interruption but slowly nodded. "Alright."

Xu Qi’an promptly instructed a Silver Gong to summon Chu Xianglong and the officials from the Three Departments.

A few minutes later, the group arrived. Their faces were cold, clearly displeased.

One of the Censors, skilled in mediating conflicts, forced a smile. "Sir Xu, what do you wish to discuss?"

"I want to change the route and travel by land instead," Xu Qi’an declared, dropping a bombshell.

"Impossible!" Chu Xianglong immediately objected, his tone resolute.

Learning from his past mistake, he stood with arms crossed, making it clear he wouldn’t compromise.

"Sir Xu, don’t be reckless. In ten days, we’ll reach Chuzhou by water. If we switch to land, it may take half a month or more," the Deputy Justice of the High Court said coldly.

“Although you’re the lead official, you still can’t make such capricious decisions.”

For normal orders, they could work around them, and let Xu Qi’an have his way, showing acknowledgment for his power as lead official. This did not, however, include changing the route.

Switching to land travel would be a logistical nightmare, requiring arrangements for horses, carriages, and transport carts—not to mention feeding and accommodating the 200-odd members of the entourage. It was precisely for these reasons that they had opted for the more efficient water route in the first place.

Moreover, in military operations or official delegations, changing routes was a serious breach of protocol, one that required the highest level of authority. Even though this was not a military mission, such a decision remained highly sensitive.

The Chief Constable Chen of the Ministry of Law, turned to Yang Yan and said in a deep voice, “Gold Gong Yang, what do you think?”

Yang Yan’s expression remained neutral as he replied, “It is indeed inappropriate.”

Even Yang Yan, a fellow Nightwatcher, disapproved of Xu Qi’an’s decision. It was evident that if he insisted on proceeding, he would invite ridicule upon himself. Other Nightwatchers likely wouldn’t support him either.

“Hmph!”

Chu Xianglong snorted coldly and said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave. Next time, spare me such brainless ideas.”

The constable from the Ministry of Law gave Xu Qi’an a scrutinising look and said, “General Chu, don’t rush off. Perhaps we should hear what Sir Xu has to say.”

Chu Xianglong turned back, surprised.

A seasoned and perceptive officer, the constable had grown increasingly uneasy over the past few days. Initially, he thought Chu Xianglong’s return to the Northern Border with the diplomatic mission served both as a convenience and as surveillance on behalf of the Zhenbei King. After all, the investigation the mission was tasked with might implicate the Zhenbei King himself.

But the more he thought about it, the less sense it made. If Chu Xianglong alone had been accompanying them, it would have been plausible. However, with the princess consort also traveling with the mission, why wasn’t an imperial guard unit assigned to escort her?

Why was she mingling with them?

A royal consort aboard a vessel full of men was rather unconventional.

The Deputy Justice of the High Court cast a glance at the constable from the Ministry of Law, frowning slightly, then looked at Xu Qi’an and Chu Xianglong with growing suspicion.

*Ah, as expected of the Ministry of Law’s constable—much sharper than these civil officials...* Xu Qi’an unfolded the map he was holding and, looking at Chu Xianglong, asked:

“General Chu, why is the princess consort traveling with the diplomatic mission?”

The constable of the Ministry of Law, the two censors from the Censorate, and the Deputy Justice of the High Court all turned to Chu Xianglong in unison.

Xu Qi’an’s question voiced the doubts or curiosity lingering in their minds.

“The princess consort is traveling to the Northern Border to reunite with King Huai. What’s the problem?” Chu Xianglong narrowed his eyes, staring sharply at Xu Qi’an.

He knew this matter had been kept under wraps from others on separate ships. And indeed, it wasn’t necessary to conceal it completely. As long as they quietly left the capital, no one would be the wiser. The purpose would still be achieved.

“Why was I, the chief official of the diplomatic mission, not informed of this in advance?” Xu Qi’an pressed.

Chu Xianglong replied indifferently, “It’s just a trivial matter. The princess consort is of noble status, and discretion is naturally preferable.”

“If her status is so noble, why wasn’t a detachment of imperial guards assigned to escort her?”

This time, the constable from the Ministry of Law interjected with a sudden question.

“Indeed, given the mixed company aboard these official vessels, if the princess consort were traveling, another ship should have been prepared,” the Deputy Justice of the High Court added with a wry smile.

“Hmm... it does seem improper,” one of the censors murmured, frowning.

*These old foxes...* Chu Xianglong swept his gaze across the officials from the three ministries, irritation flaring in his heart.

Just days ago, they had shown hostility toward Xu Qi’an while subtly currying favor with him. Yet now, when faced with a situation that might jeopardise their positions, their attitudes immediately turned ambiguous.

Seeing Chu Xianglong’s silence, Xu Qi’an sneered and addressed the group:

“As Chief Constable Chen pointed out, if the princess consort is traveling to the Northern Border to reunite with Prince Huai, His Majesty could simply dispatch imperial guards for her escort. There would be no need for this covert mixing with the diplomatic mission. Furthermore, why was this kept secret from us? Were any of you aware that the princess consort was aboard?”

The Deputy Justice of the High Court and the two censors shook their heads.

Xu Qi’an continued, “Do you know what this implies?”

The Deputy Justice of the High Court quickly asked, “Sir Xu, please speak plainly.”

Xu Qi’an’s voice was resolute: “It implies the possibility of danger—such as an ambush — an ambush targeting the princess consort.”

The expressions of the two censors and the Deputy Justice of the High Court changed, their faces turning grave.

The constable from the Ministry of Law maintained his composure, as if he had anticipated this.

Chu Xianglong, realizing that outright denial would only isolate him, snorted and said:

“The princess consort does indeed have another purpose for traveling north, but there’s no need for Sir Xu’s alarmist talk. Her departure from the capital was unknown even to you. How could anyone else know?

“An ambush requires preparation. We’re traveling north via the fastest water route, and the princess consort’s presence was kept a secret. How could there possibly be an ambush?”

The Deputy Justice of the High Court and the others nodded slowly, acknowledging the logic in Chu Xianglong’s words.

They, too, had only realised after departure that there were women aboard the ship and only later pieced together that one of them was the princess consort. If even they didn’t know beforehand, how could a potential enemy prepare an ambush?

There simply wouldn’t be enough time.

“A false alarm, a false alarm…” The Deputy Justice of the High Court exhaled, visibly relieved.

Xu Qi’an smiled and said, “Please calm yourselves, my sirs. Let me finish, and then you may decide.”

He shifted his focus back to the spread-out map and pointed to a specific spot. “At the speed we’re traveling, we’ll pass through this area by tomorrow evening at the latest.”

The group gathered around to examine the map. It depicted a narrow stretch of river with turbulent waters, flanked by high mountains on either side.

“If someone wanted to set an ambush on both banks, this location would be ideal. The swift current would prevent us from quickly changing course without risking capsizing. Meanwhile, enemies stationed in the mountains could block our escape to land. By simply lying in wait, they could easily trap us. In short, if there’s going to be an ambush, it will happen here.”

Xu Qi’an’s analysis caused the officials’ recently eased nerves to tighten once more.

Chu Xianglong scrutinised the map for a moment before refuting, “All of this assumes that an ambush exists. As I said earlier, the enemy wouldn’t have had time to prepare.

“Once we pass through this area, we’ll reach Jianzhou within ten days. There, we’ll rendezvous with the king’s forces, and the mission will be accomplished. If we switch to the land route, it will take half a month, leaving us exposed to more risks.”

Both sides presented compelling arguments, leaving the Deputy Justice of the High Court and the censors hesitant. Each option carried its own risks and drawbacks, making neither entirely reassuring.

*Then let me stoke the flames a bit more...* Xu Qi’an sneered and said:

“Switching to the land route may be slower and more prone to minor dangers, but it gives us room to maneuver. If we’re ambushed at this choke point tomorrow, it’ll be total annihilation. No chance of survival.”

This struck a nerve with the censors and the Deputy Justice of the High Court, visibly shifting their expressions.

“I agree with Sir Xu’s decision to change the route,” declared the constable from the Ministry of Law without hesitation.

“I second Sir Xu’s decision. Make the preparations immediately; we’ll change routes tomorrow,” the Deputy Justice of the High Court promptly concurred.

The two censors also sided with Xu Qi’an, his argument hitting a vital concern for civil officials. Compared to the grueling challenges of a longer land route, the prospect of annihilation on the river was far more terrifying.

No one dared to gamble with their lives.

Chu Xianglong's cheeks twitched, his fury barely contained as he glared at Xu Qi’an. “Xu Qi’an, this official wants to make a bet with you. If there is no ambush in the waters tomorrow, then what?”

Xu Qi’an pressed his hands firmly on the table, locking eyes with him without backing down. “Then you can take full control of the mission from tomorrow onward. But if there _is_ an ambush, what will you do?”

Chu Xianglong replied, “If you say one, I won’t say two.”

Xu Qi’an smirked dismissively. “You wouldn’t dare say two even now. Stop with the theatrics. Give me something substantial.”

“What do you want?”

“Three thousand taels of silver and the deployment records of the Northern Border garrison.”

“Fine,” Chu Xianglong agreed without hesitation, already planning to renege later. Once they reached the Northern Border, he would be the one in charge, with soldiers at his command and the Zhenbei King as his backing.

Xu Qi’an sneered. “Put it in writing.”

...Chu Xianglong, gritting his teeth, relented. “Fine. But if you lose, you owe me three thousand taels of silver.”

The two drafted the agreement but left the seals unsigned, waiting for the outcome the next day.

Xu Qi’an then turned to Yang Yan and, in a consulting tone, asked, “Boss, tomorrow, you’ll take the boatmen to scout ahead. How many people can you take at most?”

Yang Yan thought for a moment. “Six.”

*Six people clearly wouldn’t be enough to handle the ship. If there really was an ambush, the remaining boatmen were as good as dead...* Just as Xu Qi’an was weighing the dilemma, Yang Yan added, “Tomorrow, I can use Qi to propel the sails and steer the ship, so there’s no need for rowers. We’ll only need a few people to manage the helm.”

*With Boss’s skills, steering the ship for a short time shouldn’t be an issue…* Xu Qi’an exhaled a breath of relief and said, “Good, let’s go with that plan.”

The plan to switch routes was finalised. The officials of the three departments and an unwilling Chu Xianglong immediately began preparing for the shift, notifying the guards, female passengers, and other personnel aboard.

Xu Qi’an didn’t leave but instead sat at the table, sipping tea as he analysed, “If there’s no ambush tomorrow, it means the supposed enemies don’t exist or didn’t have enough time to prepare. In that case, we can relax a bit. And if no enemies exist, even if Chu Xianglong takes charge, it won’t be too much of a problem. We’d just have to endure him for a few days.”

Yang Yan nodded. “But if there is an ambush…”

“Then we’re in trouble,” Xu Qi’an sighed, lowering his voice. “If it’s that bad, I still have a backup plan, Boss. I’ll need to discuss it with you…”

…

The Next Morning

A group of 200 left Huangyou County. The convoy consisted of four carriages, eighteen carts loaded with supplies, and forty horses.

As for the Imperial Guard and Chu Xianglong’s soldiers, they advanced on foot.

The convoy followed the official road, kicking up clouds of dust as they headed north.

*If Yang Yan encounters no ambush, we’ll have to switch back to the water route after two days on land. The land route is exhausting, no doubt about that…* Xu Qi’an muttered internally as he rode an ordinary brown horse, far inferior to his cherished mare.

At this moment, he saw the curtain of a carriage behind him lift, revealing an unremarkable face. The person inside waved at him.

Xu Qi’an turned his horse around and approached the carriage at a slow pace, smiling. “Auntie, what’s the matter?”

“Why did we switch to the land route?” she asked from the slightly jolting carriage, her chest rising and falling with each bump, hinting at her concealed assets.

“For the safety of your princess consort,” Xu Qi’an replied.

She pondered for a moment and, surprisingly, didn’t retort as usual. Instead, she nodded seriously, acknowledging his reasoning.

…

Evening.

The Flowstone Shoals. The river was turbulent, sweeping away even stones, giving it its name.

A large three-masted ship slowly approached, navigating against the current. As it reached the middle of the shoals, the turbulent waters suddenly surged. A massive, black-scaled creature broke the surface before quickly disappearing again.

Moments later, a thunderous crash erupted, as the enormous ship was thrown high into the air.

Underneath in the foam was a black-scaled river dragon, its horns piercing through the ship hull, holding it in mid-air.

“Crack! Crack!”

Fractures rapidly spread across the ship, which splintered into fragments, scattering into the river below.

As the ship tilted, Yang Yan used his Qi to envelop six boatmen, propelling them into the air. A powerful burst of Qi under his feet launched him higher, carrying the group safely away.

The dragon plunged back into the depths, sending a towering spray of foam into the air. Moments later, a man in a black robe emerged, standing atop the water.

His features were sharp and sinister, with an aquiline nose and narrow, vertical pupils radiating coldness. Fine scales lined his cheeks.

The black-robed man surveyed the drifting debris, sneering. His voice was cold and sharp. “We’ve been tricked.”

“They won’t escape,” a calm voice replied from the dense forest along the riverbank. A young man in white stepped out, hands clasped behind his back.

The man in white, undisturbed by the failed ambush, spoke with serene confidence. “We’ve deployed enough forces this time. A mere fourth-rank like Yang Yan is no match for our numbers. The princess consort is as good as ours.”

The black-robed man frowned. “Are you certain there are no other fourth-rank experts in the envoy?”

The man in white nodded, pointing to his eyes. “Trust my sight. And even if there is another fourth-rank, our deployment ensures flawless success.”
