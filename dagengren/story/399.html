Xu Qi’an immediately looked at Li Miaozhen and found that she was not surprised.

“Just some wandering cultivators. With the Heaven and Earth Society’s strength, it shouldn’t be difficult to deal with them,” he said with a frown.

Daoist Bailian explained with a somewhat helpless tone, “Those wandering cultivators are the most troublesome. We don’t wish to commit excessive slaughter, but if we ignore them, they may turn against us.

“They are numerous and use any means necessary. They pose a significant threat to ordinary disciples. Yet, indiscriminate killing is a grave taboo…”

“Even if your life is threatened, you still can’t kill?” Xu Qi’an asked in surprise.

Bailian shook her head and said softly, “The Earth Sect cultivates merit, not a Dao heart.”

*So she means that the concept of a clear conscience doesn’t apply to the Earth Sect. Killing will always damage their merit. From this perspective, killing irredeemable villains would be fine since eliminating evil is an act of virtue. However, those wandering cultivators are not all evildoers…* Xu Qi’an came to an understanding.

Chu Yuanzhen chuckled. “I’ll go help as well.”

Hengyuan put his hands together. “Amitabha. This humble monk will also go and preach some Buddhist teachings to them.”

In truth, Hengyuan was a warrior monk. He had no precept mark, and theoretically, he was not bound by monastic orders. He could eat meat, drink alcohol, kill, and even fit in an oiran.

However, Hengyuan was an anomaly—he had always imposed the rules of zen cultivation upon himself.

Daoist Jinlian said, “The goal is not to drive them away by force, but to make them retreat on their own, so they won’t cause trouble when the lotus seeds mature.”

Daoist Bailian continued, “In fact, Heilian deliberately spread the news to attract these wandering martial artists. His real intention is to use them as cannon fodder. These past few days, they have been performing their role as scouts and expendable troops quite thoroughly.

“Moreover, there are experts among the wandering cultivators who cannot be underestimated. If this hidden threat isn’t dealt with in advance, it will be a major headache during tomorrow’s battle.”

As she spoke, Bailian kept glancing at Li Miaozhen and Xu Qi’an. By now, she had already understood Daoist Leader Jinlian’s plan.

Hearing this, Li Miaozhen confidently nodded. “I have some reputation in the jianghu, and I have many friends. Even those who don’t know me would be willing to show me some respect. Leave it to me.”

Xu Qi’an was about to follow Li Miaozhen and the others when Daoist Jinlian suddenly called out to him, “Sir Xu, hold back for a moment. I have something to discuss with you.”

His heart stirred—he already had an idea of what this was about. He stopped and watched as his four Heaven and Earth Society companions left.

Once their figures disappeared, Daoist Jinlian beckoned, and the Earth Book fragment flew out of Xu Qi’an’s pocket and landed in the old Daoist’s palm.

He held the fragment with a wordless smile.

Seeing this, Bailian tactfully said, “I’ll head outside to observe the fight.”

By the cold pool, only Daoist Jinlian and Xu Qi’an remained. The old Daoist bit his fingertip and used his blood to draw a sigil on the mirror-like surface of the Earth Book fragment.

Xu Qi’an tiptoed to peek, but Daoist Jinlian blocked his view. “The Earth Book fragment is the Earth Sect’s supreme treasure. Since you refuse to join the Earth Sect, I must follow the rule that ‘the Dao is not taught to outsiders.’”

*Daoist, you have no internet spirit at all. What is the internet spirit? It’s freeloading! No, it’s sharing! …* Xu Qi’an lampooned.

Daoist Jinlian flicked his finger, and with a crisp “ding”, the blood-red sigil suddenly glowed before fading into the Earth Book fragment.

Xu Qi’an’s mind exploded like a thunderclap, followed by excruciating pain—pain that came from his very soul.

He clutched his head, his face twitching violently. The pain lasted for more than ten seconds before it finally subsided.

“A recognised treasure is part of its owner. Forcefully severing it is like cutting off an arm…” Daoist Jinlian put away the Number Three Earth Book fragment and smiled.

“If you continue carrying it, Heilian will still be able to sense it. So for now, I’ll keep it safe. Once everything is over, I’ll return it to you.”

Xu Qi’an watched helplessly as the Earth Book fragment was tucked into Daoist Jinlian’s robes, feeling like a cabbage he had raised for eighteen years had just been stolen by a pig. He asked worriedly,

“Daoist, you must keep it safe. You must return it to me afterward.”

Daoist Jinlian chuckled. “It seems you feel quite at home in the Heaven and Earth Society.”

Xu Qi’an shook his head, his face serious. “No, it’s because my wife fund is in that Earth Book fragment.”

And it’s a wife fund ×10…

…

Outside the Yue Clan Manor.

In the ruins left behind by the bombardment, dozens of jianghu warriors stood in a standoff against the Heaven and Earth Society disciples.

A brief skirmish had just taken place, leaving both sides with wounded, though no lives had been lost.

“You little Daoists, get lost. We’re here for treasure, not to take lives.”

“That’s right! If you keep blocking our way, don’t blame us for being ruthless.”

The group of jianghu warriors spread out, waving their weapons and cursing as they issued their threats.

Opposing them, the Heaven and Earth Society disciples gripped their flying swords, jade rulers, bronze awls, cloth banners, and other magical weapons, standing firm without retreating a single step.

A young girl raised her sword and shouted, “Pah! Shameless scoundrels, coveting our Heaven and Earth Society’s supreme treasure. You think you can just take it by force? You’re dreaming!”

“Hmph!”

With a cold snort, a burly, rotund man charged forward, wielding a pair of heavy black iron hammers.

The girl in Daoist robes, her features delicate and refined, showed no fear. She lightly tossed out her flying sword, which whistled through the air with a piercing sound.

_Clang!_

Sparks flew as the burly man casually knocked the sword aside. He sneered and swung his twin hammers down at the girl with tremendous force.

But before the strike could land, a pair of porcelain-white hands caught the iron hammers mid-air. They were the hands of a girl—slender, delicate, and well-proportioned. Strangely, there was no surge of qi nor the sound of metal colliding.

She had stopped such a powerful blow with mere flesh and blood?

Everyone, whether the Heaven and Earth Society disciples or the jianghu warriors, found this scene utterly inconceivable.

The one who had acted was a beautiful young girl with deep azure eyes and sun-kissed skin.

The distinct features of someone from the Southern Marches.

The burly man’s expression changed. His wealth of combat experience told him not to hesitate—he immediately let go of his black iron hammers and swiftly retreated.

“Are all you Central Plains men this weak, using such lightweight toys?”

Lina toyed with the twin hammers in her hands like a little girl playing with dolls, tossing them up and down effortlessly.

The gathered jianghu warriors stared in shock. Even ignoring her combat ability, just that sheer strength alone was enough to crush them.

“The shaman clans… Strength Gu Tribe?”

Someone frowned, muttering uncertainly.

Lina’s azure eyes swept over them. She grinned, revealing sharp little canines, and chuckled, “There’s a saying in the Central Plains: ‘It is impolite not to reciprocate.’”

Aside from a few experts, most of the jianghu warriors tensed, quietly gripping their weapons.

_Crack…_

Lina stomped the ground, cracking the stone beneath her feet. Like a bolt from a crossbow, she shot toward the crowd.

Chaos erupted in an instant, with men sent flying and screams ringing out. She punched one warrior after another, overwhelming them with her brute strength. Yet, despite her raw power, her agility and technique were equally formidable.

Within a dozen exchanges, no one could stand against her.

_So strong…_ The Heaven and Earth Society disciples’ eyes lit up, their spirits soaring.

Before this, their attention had been on Li Miaozhen, Xu Qi’an, and Chu Yuanzhen, completely overlooking this foreign girl. They had thought she was just an extra, never expecting her to be this powerful.

Only when a man wielding a bronze staff stepped in did Lina’s offensive finally slow.

Dozens of jianghu warriors, with the staff-wielding man at the forefront, surrounded her. Among them, a few hidden weapons experts launched sneak attacks from the crowd, striking from tricky angles.

With their combined efforts, they managed to wrest back the advantage.

Taking the chance as his comrades engaged the foreign girl, the bronze staff wielder let out a roar, spun around, and swung his weapon. The air shrieked as the staff whistled toward Lina.

She lifted a hand once more, intercepting the strike with her bare palm. Then, with a powerful kick, she sent the man flying, blood spurting from his mouth.

“Lina, that’s enough.”

Li Miaozhen emerged from behind the Heaven and Earth Society disciples and called out to stop the fight.

Both sides immediately halted.

Lina casually tossed the bronze staff aside and strode back to Li Miaozhen with her long, powerful legs.

“You… you’re Lady Flying Swallow?!”

One of the jianghu warriors recognised her.

*Lady Flying Swallow?* The crowd scrutinised Li Miaozhen, their expressions shifting.

The Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect swept her gaze over the gathered warriors and asked, “Who’s in charge here?”

She understood the ways of the jianghu well. In situations requiring unity, jianghu warriors would often elect a temporary leader—someone with the most prestige or the highest reputation.

Sometimes, reputation and prestige were even more important than strength. Strength might instill fear, but only reputation could command true respect.

A burly man, clutching his stomach, stumbled forward and cupped his fists. “Liu Hu of Nanhuai Commandery, Jianzhou. Are you really Lady Flying Swallow?”

*They’re just a bunch of low-tier itinerant cultivators. No need for Xu Qi’an to step in—I can handle this…* Li Miaozhen nodded slightly and said calmly:

“Everyone, the Nine-Colored Lotus Seeds are the Earth Sect’s supreme treasure. Right now, powerful enemies surround us. With your strength, you won’t stand a chance in the fight. If you force your way in, it will only lead to death. Just for my sake, I hope you’ll retreat. Don’t meddle in this affair.”

*This…* Liu Hu’s expression flickered. He had certainly heard of Lady Flying Swallow—her name was practically legendary.

Since making her debut two years ago, this Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect had roamed the jianghu, upholding justice and righteousness. She had earned considerable fame and made countless friends.

If they offended her, she wouldn’t even need to act personally—just a few words from her, and they could find themselves hunted by those who owed her favours.

*The lotus seeds are tempting, but what she said isn’t without reason. This has always been a gamble on fate—if fate isn’t on our side, forcing the issue would be meaningless…* Liu Hu hesitated.

The other jianghu warriors were likewise wary of offending Li Miaozhen.

They might not fear the authorities, nor even the imperial court, but they dared not make an enemy of Lady Flying Swallow, who had extensive connections throughout the jianghu.

_As expected of Lady Flying Swallow. This level of influence is already comparable to some highly respected senior figures…_ Watching from a distance, Daoist Bailian nodded slightly.

_It seems that even without Xu Qi’an stepping in, Li Miaozhen alone is enough._

She then thought to herself—previous generations of Heaven Sect Holy Sons and Holy Maidens had always treated their time in the jianghu lightly, like a feather brushing water, leaving only the faintest trace.

Yet, this generation’s Holy Maiden, Li Miaozhen, was different.

As she roamed the jianghu, she became a heroine…

Li Miaozhen smiled, cupped her hands, and said, “Miaozhen thanks everyone in advance. If we cross paths in the jianghu in the future, we are friends. Should you ever need help, do not hesitate to ask. I will do my best to assist.”

The warriors were still reluctant, but with Lady Flying Swallow’s promise, their resistance softened somewhat.

“Such grand prestige, Lady Flying Swallow.”

A deep voice rang out. The speaker was a middle-aged swordsman with a neatly trimmed beard, well-defined features, and an imposing presence. In his hand, he held a black-sheathed sword with an azure blade.

Behind him, a dozen blue-robed swordsmen followed—including Young Master Liu and his master.

“It’s the Ink Pavilion!”

“It’s Pavilion Master Yang Cuixue.”

The wandering cultivators, who had previously been enduring humiliation and compromising with reality, suddenly found a pillar of support and instinctively moved closer.

Even in Jianzhou, where sects were as numerous as ox-hairs, the Ink Pavilion ranked among the top.

Li Miaozhen narrowed her eyes and scrutinised the bearded swordsman. “The Nine-Curve Sword Technique… Red River Ink Pavilion?”

Ink Pavilion was a sect that had stood unshaken in Jianzhou for a century, its foundation deep and solid. It was said that the sect’s founder attained enlightenment by observing the nine curves of the Red River, comprehending an unparalleled sword technique.

He had then established the Ink Pavilion on the banks of the Red River.

It was worth mentioning that Yang Cuixue was a veteran fourth rank expert, renowned for his swordsmanship. His most famous achievement was a battle where he single-handedly fought two Rank Fours for an entire day and night, ending in a draw.

“A pleasure to meet you.”

Yang Cuixue nodded solemnly and said, “We all know that wealth stirs the heart, let alone a treasure like the Nine-Colored Lotus. Lady Flying Swallow, using authority to suppress others—is that not unreasonable?”

Li Miaozhen smiled coldly. “I’ve long heard that Pavilion Master Yang is upright and principled, a man of reason. But all I hear now are crooked arguments. The Nine-Colored Lotus belongs to the Earth Sect. You people come to seize it by force, yet you speak as if you have the moral high ground.”

She had heard of Yang Cuixue’s reputation. It was said that he was a man of integrity who admired and supported chivalrous individuals, often giving silver to renowned righteous warriors.

Because of this, people jokingly called him “Yang the Benevolent.”

“Heh, Lady Flying Swallow is a Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect. Naturally, she wouldn’t understand the plight of us wanderers,” someone said sarcastically.

“If you’re afraid of death, why bother roaming the jianghu? My cultivation, my divine weapon—these were all earned with my life on the line.”

“Exactly! If we don’t fight for it, how will we know who will claim the prize in the end?”

With someone backing them up, the scattered cultivators immediately spoke with more confidence.

Yang Cuixue shook his head and said, “Lady Flying Swallow, as a Holy Maiden of the Heaven Sect, lacks neither cultivation techniques nor esteemed masters. How could she understand the struggles of wandering cultivators?

“Some people are stuck at a bottleneck for decades, unable to advance, yet they have no master to guide them.

“Some lack a suitable weapon, spending years wielding nothing but common iron. Without risking their lives, how can they advance? How can they make a name for themselves?

“I simply believe that while you can defeat them—even kill them—you should not strip them of their right to fight for it.”

Daoist Bailian frowned slightly, while the disciples behind Li Miaozhen tensed up again, preparing for battle.

Li Miaozhen narrowed her eyes in frustration. With this man’s interference, the mob was getting restless again.

She could no longer suppress them.

Resting her hand on her sword hilt, she said flatly, “Is Pavilion Master Yang representing the Wulin Alliance in this matter?”

Her flying sword buzzed, ready to be unleashed at a moment’s notice.

The dozen blue-robed swordsmen behind Yang Cuixue drew their swords in unison.

Yang Cuixue raised his hand and pressed against his sword hilt. Instantly, the sword aura Li Miaozhen had just released dissipated into nothing.

“Lady Flying Swallow is a Daoist disciple. In the end, your swordsmanship is still lacking.” Yang Cuixue spoke indifferently.

*Li Miaozhen had no trouble intimidating ordinary wandering cultivators, but this Ink Pavilion Master’s qi was thick and formidable—even among Rank Fours, he was a powerhouse…* Chu Yuanzhen frowned.

He could no longer stand idly by.

He stepped forward with a smile and said, “I am Chu Yuanzhen.”

Yang Cuixue was momentarily taken aback before bowing his fists formally. “The capital’s number one swordsman—I have long heard of your name.”

Chu Yuanzhen then said, “I wonder if Pavilion Master Yang would be willing to give me some face? Or perhaps grant the Human Sect some face?”

Yang Cuixue shook his head. “I am merely a swordsman. The Human Sect belongs to the Daoist lineage—what does it have to do with me, or with anyone here?

“As for Brother Chu… forgive my bluntness, but you have yet to accomplish anything significant. What face do you have to offer?”

Chu Yuanzhen’s face darkened.

Yang Cuixue continued, “I am a swordsman, and the way of the sword is straightforward. I speak my mind. The Daoist sects remain detached from worldly matters, making people fear them but not respect them. Lady Flying Swallow may act with righteousness, but that is not enough to make us give up this opportunity. Brother Chu—let’s not even speak of you.”

Liu Hu nodded firmly in agreement.

Li Miaozhen sneered. “After all that talk, what you really mean is that no one’s face is worth anything here. Why not cut the nonsense and settle this with our blades?”

Yang Cuixue shook his head again. “No, it’s not that no one’s face is worth anything—only that the two of you are not enough. Those who act for the nation, for the people, and are beloved by the common folk—they are the ones whose words matter.”

“Interesting.”

At that moment, Xu Qi’an stepped out from behind the Heaven and Earth Society disciples, smiling as he approached.

“I wonder, Pavilion Master Yang, will you give me face?”
