# 410. A Punch

Xu Qi’an’s gaze left Cao Qingyang and first fell upon Yang Cuixue, Fu Jingmen, and the others not far behind him, naturally including the graceful beauty, Xiao Yuenu.

He swept his gaze past the members of the Wulin Alliance, then examined the Lotus Daoists of the Earth Sect, as well as the black-robed, masked secret agents of King Huai.

The spies’ expressions were concealed by their masks, but their eyes burned with naked hatred.

It was this very Xu Qi’an who caused such an uproar in the capital, forcing His Majesty to issue a self-reproach edict, leaving King Huai disgraced even in death — his bones denied burial in the imperial tombs, his tablet forbidden from entering the Ancestral Shrine.

The mysterious master in Chuzhou, who fought one against five with overwhelming ferocity, was the one who killed King Huai. The spies hated him, but they bore no resentment — the strong feeding on the weak was the way of the world.

What made them seethe with rage and disgust was Xu Qi’an’s behaviour. A mere ant, who could have been crushed by a single finger when King Huai was alive, now leapt about like a clown, using King Huai’s death as a stepping stone to fame and fortune.

Utterly infuriating.

The Lotus Daoists of the Earth Sect were even more blatant, some sneering, some smirking coldly, and others flashing provoking smiles as they met Xu Qi’an’s gaze.

“A bunch of clowns, not worth worrying about!”

Xu Qi’an shook his head and withdrew his gaze.

The King Huai secret spies and Lotus Daoists’ brows twitched.

“Alliance Leader Cao, the lotus seeds are about to ripen — they cannot withstand great disturbances, so no formation has been set here.” Xu Qi’an turned his gaze back to Cao Qingyang and said gravely:

“You wouldn’t want to ruin the lotus seeds, would you?”

Cao Qingyang nodded casually, “What I want is the lotus root. The seeds are just a bonus — having them would be good, but doing without them is no loss. Go on, Silver Gong Xu, how do you want to fight?”

Xu Qi’an removed the black-gold sabre from his lower back and casually tossed it aside. With a ‘clack’, the sheathed blade landed beside the pool.

He looked at Cao Qingyang, raising his chin slightly: “No release of qi, no weapons — let’s have a contest of body alone.”

Clever!

Not far away, Xiao Yuenu gave a small nod. This move effectively pulled Alliance Leader Cao down to Xu Qi’an’s level.

Without qi, the might of a third rank martial artist could not be brought into play; without weapons, Cao Qingyang’s strongest killing techniques — his sabre techniques and sabre intent — were excluded.

Finally, given Cao Qingyang’s regard for Silver Gong Xu, he would undoubtedly grant him this respect.

People of the jianghu placed great importance on face, sometimes more than anything else.

“Very well, a contest of body alone. When the lotus seeds ripen, if I haven’t beaten you by then, I won’t touch them.”

As expected, Cao Qingyang agreed.

The “audience” was shocked — Alliance Leader Cao was giving Silver Gong Xu immense respect, and having made such a public promise, he would not break his word.

In other words, if Silver Gong Xu could hold out until the lotus seeds ripened without being defeated, Alliance Leader Cao would not fight for them.

The disciples of the Heaven and Earth Society silently prayed that Silver Gong Xu could hold out for a while.

*Senior Uncle Jinlian inviting Master Xu to assist truly was a stroke of genius…* Qiu Chanyi’s face lit up with joy. This Alliance Leader Cao had broken through five barriers in a single breath, like a knife through butter.

Neither Chu Yuanzhen nor Li Miaozhen had forced him to yield, yet he was willing to make such a concession to Young Master Xu.

There were very few youthful heroes in the world with a reputation as resplendent as Young Master Xu’s.

Her admiration and infatuation for Young Master Xu grew even deeper.

*T-this Cao Qingyang is willing to make such an enormous concession?* Daoist Bailian’s face was full of astonishment — she realised she had still underestimated Xu Qi’an’s renown.

“Even if it’s purely martial arts, the Alliance Leader can’t possibly lose. It’s just a matter of how long Silver Gong Xu can hold out.” Fu Jingmen said.

“Silver Gong Xu seems to be skilled with the sabre as well.” Yang Cuixue analysed.

Listening to their discussion, Xiao Yuenu said softly, her voice gentle and alluring:

“Alliance Leader Cao’s physique is unparalleled, but Silver Gong Xu also possesses an indestructible golden body. Both of them are sabre masters rather than martial artists focused solely on the body. In this case, it may indeed turn into a battle of dragons and tigers.”

At that moment, not far away, the secret agent Tianshu sneered and interjected: “A battle of dragons and tigers? What if I told you that Xu Qi’an is merely a Rank Six martial artist?”

His words sparked an uproar, followed by a wave of chatter.

The onlookers realised that they actually had no clear concept of Silver Gong Xu’s rank.

After all, Nightwatcher Silver Gongs ranged from Rank Seven Refining Spirit to Rank Five Transforming Force; their titles were not determined by rank. Moreover, Xu Qi’an’s early feats included single-handedly facing thousands of rebel soldiers in Yunzhou and engaging in Buddhist battles — all acts of fighting beyond his rank.

The only thing they had to go on was Silver Gong Xu’s feat last night, slaying that mysterious young noble, who was no weakling, and had two peak Rank Four bodyguards.

Therefore, in everyone’s minds, even if Silver Gong Xu wasn’t Rank Four, he had to be at least Rank Five Transforming Force.

“Silver Gong Xu is only Rank Six? How could he kill that young noble?”

“How could a sixth rank infiltrate the palace and capture two Dukes? He’s just talking nonsense.”

“But these people seem to be with the court — they must know Xu Qi’an’s background inside out.”

“What’s the point of all this? We’ll know the truth as soon as they fight.”

Cao Qingyang scrutinised Xu Qi’an. “You’re only Rank Six? That is somewhat unexpected.”

The intelligence gathered suggested that Xu Qi’an’s latest feat was overpowering the top disciples of both the Human Sect and Earth Sect. Although he used Confucian spells, the external assessment was that he himself had to be at least Rank Five, with no great disparity.

Yet here he was — just a sixth rank martial artist.

Xu Qi’an gave no reply, merely offering a faint smile. “I look forward to Alliance Leader Cao’s guidance.”

As his words fell, he suddenly launched forward, his foot slamming into the ground with a muffled thud. A ferocious flying knee strike shot straight at Cao Qingyang.

As he moved, a golden hue emerged at the centre of his brow, swiftly spreading to cover his entire body.

Cao Qingyang took a step forward to meet him head-on. His left hand brushed aside Xu Qi’an’s knee strike, while his right palm flipped over and pressed against Xu Qi’an’s chest.

Clang!

The impact rang out like a great bell, sending Xu Qi’an flying backwards. He tumbled, dissipating the force, before finally steadying himself.

“He really isn’t Rank Five…” Fu Jingmen was visibly shaken.

A clamour erupted, and the gathered heroes whispered among themselves. From that brief exchange, the sharp-eyed ones immediately saw Xu Qi’an’s true level.

The Heaven and Earth Society disciples’ faces darkened, and their hearts sank along with them.

Though they cultivated the Daoist system, they were still quite familiar with the martial path. After all, the martial path was far less mysterious than others, as countless people had walked this road.

Transforming Force was the peak of martial body techniques. Before Rank Five, martial artists’ close combat, while formidable, wasn’t enough to make high-rank cultivators of other paths fear them.

It was only after Rank Five that martial artists became the nightmare of high-rank cultivators from other systems.

Transforming Force martial artists had perfect control over their physical power — they could ignore inertia, balance, and other such limitations. Once they closed the distance, the enemy would face a relentless barrage of blows until victory or defeat was decided, or the distance was somehow widened again.

Xu Qi’an hadn’t reached Rank Five. That meant this battle was unwinnable, and dragging it out was nothing more than a delusion.

After regaining his footing, an image naturally surfaced in Xu Qi’an’s mind: Cao Qingyang appearing at his flank, chopping at the back of his neck with a knife-hand strike.

There was no time to think. Relying on martial instinct, he crouched down and rolled forward.

Just as he completed this set of movements, Cao Qingyang appeared beside him, striking with a knife-hand.

The strike, of course, hit nothing but air. Surprise flickered in Cao Qingyang’s eyes. His figure vanished again, descending from above with a fist crashing down.

Yet before he could strike, Xu Qi’an suddenly stumbled sideways, like a drunk man losing his balance, sliding two steps to the left and perfectly dodging the blow.

*First, adjust to the rhythm. His attacks are too fast — I can’t keep up. Focus on evasion first, then counterattack when there’s an opening…*

Relying on an extraordinary sense of perception, Xu Qi’an repeatedly foresaw and pre-empted Cao Qingyang’s attacks, scrambling to avoid them.

To the spectators, it looked like the two were playing a game of cat and mouse.

Finally, after Xu Qi’an leaned back to dodge Cao Qingyang’s whip kick, he seized his chance. Using his right foot as a pivot, he spun fiercely, rotating around to Cao Qingyang’s back.

In the next instant, a torrential rain of blows fell — punches, knee strikes, elbow strikes — dozens of attacks erupted in a flash, striking Cao Qingyang’s steel-like body and producing a cacophony of clangs.

*This…* Xiao Yuenu’s beautiful eyes froze slightly. She suspected Cao Qingyang was holding back, giving Xu Qi’an face.

“There’s something off. He seems to be anticipating Cao Qingyang’s moves, making effective pre-emptive responses.” Fu Jingmen’s hands slowly clenched into fists, itching to try it himself.

*How is he doing this…?* Yang Cuixue’s brows furrowed. The ability Xu Qi’an displayed had already surpassed a martial artist’s instinctive danger sense — it was as though he truly had foresight.

“Huh? Isn’t he below Rank Five? How is he suppressing Cao Qingyang instead?”

“Cao Qingyang isn’t being serious, right? Maybe he’s giving Silver Gong Xu face, letting him off easy.”

The crowd chattered noisily.

That explanation was something they could accept. In the jianghu, giving others face was the most important thing.

Without giving face, how could one survive in the jianghu? Especially for someone like Silver Gong Xu, whose righteousness was known far and wide.

“Alliance Leader Cao, time is precious. How long are you going to waste on this Xu boy?” The female agent, Tianshu, said coldly. “Allow me to remind you, this man is exceedingly sinister. Don’t let yourself trip up here.”

Cao Qingyang could feel the force behind Xu Qi’an’s strikes. The pain was clear, and although it was just pain, for a Rank Six martial artist to possess such power was truly rare.

He turned and kicked Xu Qi’an away, but once again, Xu Qi’an anticipated it, even using the kick to create distance.

“You seem to be able to predict my attacks. What sort of trick is this?” Cao Qingyang frowned in curiosity.

“A unique secret art,” Xu Qi’an replied.

“Then I’ll just consider it the Refining Spirit realm’s natural instinct.”

Cao Qingyang rolled his neck, speaking indifferently: “Do you know the fatal weakness of martial instinct?”

Xu Qi’an’s pupils contracted sharply. He crouched and rolled forward again.

Bang!

Cao Qingyang appeared in front of him, sending him flying with a kick. This kick landed solidly, blasting him away like a cannonball. He smashed through a rockery, cracked the flagstone ground, and embedded himself deep into a wall.

Looking at the battered young man, Cao Qingyang smiled: “If the speed of an attack surpasses your danger sense, you won’t be able to react effectively.”

*I get it — it’s just CPU overload…* Xu Qi’an pulled himself out of the wall, grinning. “Warm-up’s over.”

This time, he took the initiative and charged, only to be effortlessly countered by Cao Qingyang. A storm of punches followed, pounding his face.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Crackling explosions rang in Xu Qi’an’s ears, each punch heavier and faster than the last, pounding into his face again and again.

His protective golden body began to shake, and the ground beneath them fractured.

*When he punches, all his power follows a straight line, with his arm muscles working in perfect unison…*

*Why can’t I do that? Why does my strength scatter during my punches…*

*The ‘focus’ of One Blade from Heaven and Earth only lasts a fleeting instant. I’ve only learned that fleeting moment — I can’t maintain it for long…*

While enduring the beating, Xu Qi’an closely observed Cao Qingyang’s qi movements. He realised that every punch from Cao Qingyang carried exactly the same power, perfectly replicated each time.

Martial artists below Rank Five, and ordinary people, could never guarantee that every punch they threw would have exactly the same force.

He collapsed all his qi and blood, twisting it into a single thread, then stomped his foot into Cao Qingyang’s abdomen, sending him flying.

That kick — with all power condensed into a single strike — had already reached the standard of Rank Five.

*Transforming Force? No, not yet — he’s only a step away from Transforming Force…* Realisation dawned on Cao Qingyang. He withdrew a short distance, dispelled the force, then lunged at Xu Qi’an again, giving him no chance to catch his breath.

To the spectators, this was a one-sided beating. Alliance Leader Cao’s martial arts were unparalleled, his attacks ferocious, leaving Silver Gong Xu either leaping or rolling to evade.

Occasionally, Xu Qi’an would counterattack, but after a move or two, he would be countered again, leading to yet another round of relentless assault.

Clang!

Cao Qingyang struck aside Xu Qi’an’s crossed arms, his palm pressing against the golden chest, abruptly unleashing his strength. Silver Gong Xu was sent flying, only for Cao Qingyang to seize his ankle and forcibly drag him back.

Another flurry of brutal martial attacks followed.

Fists pummelled his chest, abdomen, and face. Xu Qi’an could not find his footing, staggering backwards, utterly defenceless.

“I must say, the Buddhist Vajra Technique is indeed one of the most powerful body protection techniques in this world.”

“I think ‘tortoise shell technique’ would be more fitting. This Daoist couldn’t match such resilience.”

“Tut tut, even I’m starting to feel sorry for Alliance Leader Cao’s fists — they must be aching by now.”

“Silver Gong Xu, just hang in there for another incense stick’s time. Who knows, you might make it onto the Martial Roll purely through your tortoise shell technique.”

“Haha, senior brother, isn’t the Martial Roll only for the best of the martial world? Silver Gong Xu is a court official — oh, I forgot, he’s not a Silver Gong anymore.”

These sarcastic remarks naturally came from the Earth Sect’s lotus Daoists and disciples.

The Earth Sect’s Demon Daoists never missed an opportunity to vent their inner darkness and maliciousness.

Tianji and Tianshu exchanged a glance, years of cooperation allowing them to understand each other instantly.

Once Cao Qingyang broke Xu Qi’an’s Vajra Technique, they would strike and harvest this little bastard’s life.

Li Miaozhen had tried to intervene several times, only to be stopped by Chu Yuanzhen.

“Don’t act recklessly. His life isn’t in danger yet, but if you intervene, the duel between Cao Qingyang and Xu Qi’an will be invalidated, and the situation will spiral out of control,” Chu Yuanzhen warned in a low voice.

Master Hengyuan folded his hands in prayer and sighed repeatedly.

Such a fearsome opponent filled one with despair. Xu Qi’an had done his utmost, and Master Hengyuan only hoped he would continue to do so.

Lina’s right hand hung down, her skin wrapped in fine white threads like silkworm silk, healing her wounds.

She gritted her small silver teeth and huffed, “If my dad were here, he’d smash his dog head with one punch.”

Li Miaozhen sneered, “Your dad?”

Chu Yuanzhen coughed, reminding her, “The Chief of the Strength Gu tribe. He achieved third rank twenty years ago.”

Li Miaozhen: “Oh, uh, never mind then.”

Clang!

A deafening noise interrupted their conversation. Looking over, they saw Cao Qingyang punch Xu Qi’an to his knees, leaving two deep pits in the ground.

“I’ll give you five punches. Savour them well. After five punches, I’ll shatter your golden body.” With that, Cao Qingyang struck his second punch, landing it atop Xu Qi’an’s head.

Clang!

The Vajra Technique seemed unable to fully withstand such terrifying force, and dimmed somewhat.

Clang!

The third punch dimmed the golden glow further. As one rose, the other waned — Xu Qi’an could no longer remain unscathed, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

Qiu Chanyi burst into tears, covering her mouth as tears rolled down her cheeks.

The other disciples’ eyes reddened too, feeling that Silver Gong Xu had already done more than enough. Even if he conceded now, they would hold no grievance.

Clang!

The fourth punch left the golden lacquer patchy, resembling a weathered, aged Buddha statue — a clear sign of the Vajra Technique’s impending collapse.

Xu Qi’an bled from his seven orifices, his vision blurring. The residual force of the punch reverberated within him, vibrating incessantly, wreaking havoc on his muscles, bones, and internal organs.

That vibration was like a fuse, igniting one cell after another, causing them to vibrate in unison, creating resonance.

He understood now.

He finally understood the essence of Rank Five Transforming Force.

Cao Qingyang had used this brutal, savage method to instil in him the essence of Transforming Force.

Cao Qingyang clenched his fist, pulled back his arm, the fifth punch gathering strength.

Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen struck simultaneously, with Lina and Master Hengyuan following right after. On the other side, even Daoist Bailian could no longer stand idle.

Anyone could see that if this punch landed, Silver Gong Xu would be in mortal danger.

“Alliance Leader, show mercy!” Xiao Yuenu cried out in alarm.

“Alliance Leader, show mercy, don’t take Silver Gong Xu’s life!” Yang Cuixue shouted.

Tianji and Tianshu slashed out with their blades, targeting Chu Yuanzhen and the others, clearly intending to block them.

The lotus Daoists sneered.

Xu Qi’an’s pupils reflected the approaching fist, growing larger and larger. The force it carried blew his fringe askew, while his martial intuition sent out urgent danger signals.

His face was blank, his expression rigid, as though still reeling from dizziness — yet his fists clenched instinctively, and some dormant cells in his body awakened at this moment.

Some cells, previously beyond his control, now surged to life.

All his strength twisted into a single strand, with every cell exerting force in the same direction.

He put his full strength into a punch, meeting Cao Qingyang’s fist head-on.
