# 263. Xu Xinnian: I'm Meeting a lot of Nutcases this Year

In a small courtyard, Daoist Jinlian put away the Earth Book fragment, frowning silently.

Each member of the Earth Book chat group was a person of great fortune. The loss of any one of them was something he did not wish to see.

*The conflict of Heaven and Man is a matter for the elders; there’s no need for the younger generation to fight to the death. But if no one intervenes, with Li Miaozhen’s stubbornness and Number Four's sharpness, I fear it will end with one dead and the other seriously injured.*

*Our Earth Sect cannot meddle in the Heaven and Human Sects' dispute. Number Six is not one for words, and Number One’s status makes it inconvenient for him to intervene… It seems I’ll have to push Xu Qi'an into the middle to smooth things over. Let him involve himself in the conflict of Heaven and Man, to lessen the hostility between Li Miaozhen and Number Four. This way, I can give the sect an explanation without needing them to fight to the death.*

*But his cultivation level is still too low. He’s not qualified to interfere in a fight between Li Miaozhen and Number Four unless he can quickly cultivate to Bronze Skin and Iron Bones.*

Cultivating Bronze Skin and Iron Bones in a short time was indeed a difficult task.

Daoist Jinlian furrowed his brows, pondering for a long time without coming up with a suitable plan, until he heard a sharp cat's meow from the courtyard.

… Shortly after, an orange cat left happily, tail held high.

Inside the house, Daoist Jinlian lay on the bed, his face serene.

...

After breakfast, Xu Qi'an rode his mare, bringing Zhong Li with him to the Nightwatchers Constabulary.

"I can’t guarantee you’ll be allowed into the constabulary, especially not the Tower of Noble Spirit," Xu Qi'an said, turning his head to Zhong Li.

She wasn’t riding a horse but was instead walking beside his mare, leisurely as if taking a stroll after a meal.

_Is this a Shrinking Ground spell?_ Xu Qi'an silently envied as he watched her.

As soon as they entered the Constabulary, a Silver Gong hurried out with a dozen Bronze Gongs, running into Xu Qi'an.

The Silver Gong stopped to greet him, noticing the disheveled, hemp-clad Zhong Li, and asked, "Is this a Jianghu criminal who violated the law? Why isn’t she bound?"

Xu Qi'an was momentarily stunned, then asked, "What makes you say that?"

The Silver Gong explained, “You weren’t on duty yesterday, so you wouldn’t know. Duke Wei issued a proclamation yesterday. In three months, it will be the once-in-sixty-years conflict of Heaven and Man.

“Before that, the outstanding disciples of both Heaven and Human sects will compete first. For many martial artists, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

"As a result, many people of the Jianghu have flocked to the capital, eager to witness the duel between the disciples of Heaven and Man. My colleagues are stationed at the city gates, registering those entering and screening for potential spies from other nations."

_Hmm? So Number Four and Number Two hold such high positions in the martial world?_ Xu Qi'an thought, feeling he hadn’t noticed before. _Perhaps it’s because I’m from a eunuch's family…_ He nodded and bid farewell to the Silver Gong.

He arranged for Zhong Li to stay at Li Yuchun’s Spring Wind Hall, while he headed to the Tower of Noble Spirit.

Zhong Li, being the fifth disciple of the Jianzheng, held a relatively high status, but it was useless. She couldn’t meet Wei Yuan.

After the guard announced his arrival, Xu Qi'an ascended to the tea room on the seventh floor.

Wei Yuan stood in front of a giant geomantic map, still dressed in his usual azure robe. His hair was simply tied with a black jade hairpin, hands behind his back, and his sleeves hung low.

In terms of bearing, looks, and talent, Wei Yuan was unrivaled among the middle-aged and elderly men Xu Qi'an had met. Among the younger generation, in terms of appearance, Erlang and Nangong Qianrou were the best.

But in terms of overall capability, Xu Qi'an believed that the elder Xu brother was superior, and naturally the undisputed leader.

"Your appointment letter is on the table. Take it to the Ministry of Personnel later and get your badge and uniform," Wei Yuan said without turning around, simply pointing to the desk.

Xu Qi'an glanced at the desk and indeed saw a promotion letter stamped with Wei Yuan’s seal.

The Nightwatchers' affairs were entirely under Wei Yuan’s control. He could promote or demote anyone at will, so Xu Qi'an had no concerns about his promotion to Silver Gong.

"Once you become a Silver Gong, you won’t need to patrol the streets anymore. You’ll be able to sit in the office, giving you more time to manage as you see fit," Wei Yuan hinted. "Your talent is good, and your time shouldn’t be wasted on routine duties."

_This is the first time I’ve ever heard a boss tell his employee, ‘You shouldn’t waste your time on something as trivial as work.’_ Xu Qi'an thought, lamenting that he hadn’t met such a leader in his previous life, where he had dutifully worked as a corporate slave for nearly ten years.

He picked up the promotion letter and was about to take his leave when Wei Yuan said, "Don’t be in a rush to go. The disciples of the Human Sect and Heaven Sect will soon duel. The capital will likely be unstable during this time, with troublemaking martial artists appearing here and there."

"Understood, sir. Your subordinate will ensure the inner city remains secure," Xu Qi'an immediately replied.

Wei Yuan nodded slowly and continued, "You’ve had contact with Li Miaozhen in Yunzhou. What’s your impression of her?"

Li Miaozhen’s identity as a disciple of the Heaven Sect had already been disclosed to Inspector Zhang and Jiang Lyuzhong in Baidi City. After Xu Qi'an's death, Inspector Zhang had sent a memorial to the capital during the bandit suppression campaign, highlighting Li Miaozhen's outstanding contributions.

He had even requested that the court grant her an official position.

Naturally, the request had been denied. After all, Luo Yuheng was the National Teacher of the Great Feng, and the Human Sect and Heaven Sect were like fire and water. This wasn’t a matter to be taken lightly.

_My impression of her…_ Xu Qi'an pondered, feeling it could be summed up in one line: _We unbound the general’s armor and shared a warm spring night in the bedchamber._

"They’re just two disciples. Does Duke Wei need to be so concerned?" Xu Qi'an asked.

"The attitudes of the disciples will determine the attitudes of their sect leaders," Wei Yuan replied, turning to look at him with a serious expression. "The Heaven Sect’s leader is a first-rank."

This revelation left Xu Qi'an both shocked and unsurprised. Among the three Daoist sects, the Heaven Sect was the most powerful. The leaders of the Human Sect and Earth Sect were second-rank. If the Heaven Sect didn’t have a first-rank leader, then how could it come to dominate?

But this also meant that Luo Yuheng was destined to lose, didn’t it?

Xu Qi'an wasn’t particularly interested in whether Luo Yuheng would win or lose. He understood Wei Yuan's implication: if the duel between the disciples wasn’t handled properly, the leaders of the Heaven and Human Sects might fight to the death.

First- and second-rank cultivators were the pinnacle of power in the world. Even Wei Yuan, with his unparalleled intellect, couldn’t afford to be careless. Meanwhile, the Jianzheng, the hidden trump card of the capital, was only a first-rank.

"Sir, there’s something I haven’t reported to you yet," Xu Qi'an said, preparing to share the secrets of the Heaven and Earth Society.

Wei Yuan gave a soft hum, signaling him to continue.

"Li Miaozhen is a member of the Heaven and Earth Society and holds Fragment Number Two. The disciple sent by the Human Sect should be the swordsman you once praised as the best in the capital," Xu Qi'an reported.

This news took Wei Yuan by surprise. He left the geomantic map, returned to his desk, and sat down, his voice steady as he said, "Tell me everything in detail."

Xu Qi'an immediately recounted the chat history from the "Earth Book" group chat from the previous night.

"Your timing is impeccable," Wei Yuan nodded approvingly.

His "favour" toward this Bronze Gong, Xu Qi'an, was complex and multi-faceted. The first factor was character—reliable and trustworthy. Talent was the second factor—Xu Qi'an's potential was something Wei Yuan believed was worth cultivating.

Then, there was Xu Qi'an's personality, which differed from character. He was clever, slick, and knew how to flatter, but maintained his principles. Lastly, Xu Qi'an always managed to surprise Wei Yuan, whether in solving cases or providing valuable intelligence, constantly proving his worth.

Wei Yuan was pleased that Xu Qi'an wasn't like some prodigies who, despite their immense talent, were utterly useless when it came to real-world tasks.

"Try to cooperate with Daoist Jinlian as much as possible," Wei Yuan said out of the blue.

Seeing Xu Qi'an’s confusion, he explained, "Daoist Jinlian founded the Heaven and Earth Society and has been searching across Jiuzhou for worthy holders of the Earth Book fragments. His original intent was to clean his house and eliminate the sect leader who had fallen into the demonic way."

Xu Qi'an nodded; Daoist Jinlian had personally informed Wei Yuan of his motives.

"Thus he won't just stand by and watch the holders of the Earth Book fragments fight themselves. He'll try to mediate, but since he’s from the Earth Sect, which has always remained neutral, he can’t interfere directly. He’ll likely ask for your help."

"What on earth can I help with... ha, haha..." Xu Qi'an began to laugh, but his smile slowly froze.

Unaware of how Xu Qi'an had been boasting in the Earth Book chat group, Wei Yuan didn't notice the shift in his expression. Instead, he said, "The Western Sect is also on its way to the capital."

Xu Qi'an was taken aback and wondered how Wei Yuan knew this... but soon realized that a formal visit from the Western Sect to the capital of the Great Feng wouldn’t go unnoticed. It was like a diplomatic visit between two nations—everything had to be arranged in advance.

*With the imperial examinations, the Western Sect, and the impending conflict of Heaven and Man... things are getting complicated,* Xu Qi'an thought, feeling the weight of the situation.

At that moment, the sound of drums and gongs echoed from outside, accompanied by distant shouts of, "Fire! Fire!"

A fire?!

Xu Qi'an had been a Nightwatcher for almost half a year, and this was his first time encountering such an incident. His heart sank as a sense of foreboding filled him.

"Duke Wei, I must take my leave!" he said hastily.

He quickly stood up, cupped his hands in salute, and rushed out of the Tower of Noble Spirit, scanning the area. He soon spotted clerks and Nightwatchers carrying buckets and rushing toward the direction of Spring Breeze Hall.

...

Fifteen minutes later, a Golden Gong on duty managed to extinguish the fire, but Spring Breeze Hall had been reduced to ashes, now nothing but a charred ruin. Thankfully, there were no casualties.

The Golden Gong, clearly upset, ordered the Nightwatchers to investigate the cause of the fire.

In a quiet courtyard nearby, Zhong Li sat on the ground, her hair singed and curled. Her linen robe was burned through in several spots, revealing patches of her pale skin.

"I was just sitting in the room, minding my own business, and somehow the fire started. If you had been a little later, I might have been roasted..." she said, still shaken.

"You're a Fifth-grade Arcanist, surely ordinary fire couldn't harm you?"

"I was meditating and had a Qi deviation," Zhong Li explained.

"..."

Feeling sorry for her, Xu Qi'an said, "Let me take you to bathe and change into some clean clothes."

...

As dusk fell, Xu Xinnian, having finished his first round of the imperial exams, left the examination hall. Following the other scholars out onto the street, he looked around and realized that his father, brother, and sister hadn’t come to pick him up.

"Father and Brother are probably still on duty, and Mother and Sister likely didn’t feel comfortable coming out alone," he consoled himself.

He slung his book box over his shoulder and began walking home, casting a minor spell on himself as he did. With a soft pat on his leg, he activated his literary aura and chanted:

"Light as a swallow!"

An invisible force wrapped around him, and he moved with the speed and grace of a gust of wind, walking as fast as a carriage.

Suddenly, a voice called out from ahead, "What a good ‘light as a swallow’!"

Xu Xinnian stopped in his tracks and turned toward the voice. Standing by the roadside was a young swordsman in an azure robe, carrying a sword on his back. He had a handsome, unruly look, and though he appeared young, the lock of white hair at his forehead hinted at a life full of experiences.

Before Xu Xinnian could respond, the swordsman smiled and said, “The first round of the imperial exams is over, and if it were up to my past habits, the next three days would be spent drinking and celebrating with classmates at the Jiaofangsi.

“That was nine years ago. By now, the courtesans of that time must be past their prime or have found good husbands. But I’ve heard there’s a new Oiran in the capital, famous for her poetry and music. I think I’ll go and see for myself.

"Brother, why don’t we go together?"

Xu Xinnian listened in silence, thinking only one thing: *This man is an idiot.*

The way he spoke, so familiarly, as if they were close friends, and then the way he winked at Xu Xinnian... But Xu Xinnian was absolutely certain that he had never met this person before.

*What’s with today? First, a strange monk before the exam, and now a foolish swordsman after...* Ignoring the man, Xu Xinnian quickly ran away.

Boys need to protect themselves out in the world.

...

The sun slowly set, casting a red glow across the sky. Xu Qi'an led Zhong Li to the Jiaofangsi.

"I wonder if Fuxiang has recovered from her illness. Women of this era are so delicate, falling ill at the slightest chill," Xu Qi'an mused as he brought Zhong Li along to check on Fuxiang's condition.

Zhong Li, still in her linen robe, had just bathed, but her hair was a tangled mess, hanging down to cover her face.

Xu Qi'an guessed that she might be disfigured or have some sort of scar, which is why she never showed her true face.
