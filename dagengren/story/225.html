# 225. Xu Qi'an's Helpless Choice

The corpse couldn't possibly be Governor Song, because he had enough time to escape. There was no reason for him to sit at home and wait for death.

The possibility of the Warlock of Dreams silencing him is unlikely, as it hadn't reached the point where he needed to be silenced. There was ample time to retreat; there was no need to go to such extremes.

So why create the illusion of a guilty suicide?

Xu Qi'an had two guesses: First, Governor Song was also a scapegoat. Killing him to silence him would cut off the clues while fabricating the illusion of a suicide to confuse Inspector Zhang.

Second, Governor Song was stalling for time.

During previous discussions of the case, Xu Qi'an, Inspector Zhang, and others had reached a consensus that if they pushed the enemy into a corner, it would definitely result in a bloody confrontation.

Therefore, Inspector Zhang had twice launched surprise attacks, not giving the enemy a chance to react.

But this time, it seemed the enemy was a step ahead.

*If it's a stall for time, then Governor Song's corpse is a fake. As an experienced coroner, how could he not detect a disguise? Unless the coroner is a werewolf...*

Based on this hypothesis, the Inspector would be in danger.

At this moment, Inspector Zhang had only the Huben Guards and Jiang Lyuzhong with him. Most of the Nightwatchers were stationed at the post. Jiang Lyuzhong was formidable, but let's not forget, there was also a fourth-rank Warlock of Dreams on the enemy side.

If Jiang Lyuzhong were entangled by the Warlock of Dreams, how could the Huben Guards alone protect the Inspector?

The formidable Silver Gongs and Bronze Gongs were the backbone of this escort team.

*Governor Song had been entrenched in Baidi City for many years. With Yang Chuannan now a prisoner, he had no rival among the local forces... Although he couldn't mobilize the garrison troops, the Five City Troops within the city were under the Governor's command...*

Thinking of this, Xu Qi'an immediately summoned all the Nightwatchers at the post and shared his suspicions with them.

Upon hearing this, the Nightwatchers' expressions turned grave. Though some remained sceptical, considering the Inspector's safety, they preferred to believe it rather than dismiss it.

"Four of you stay behind to guard the post, the rest follow me," commanded a Silver Gong.

He glanced at Xu Qi'an, "Xu Ningyan, you stay at the post."

Everyone knew Xu Qi'an's current condition wasn't suitable for high-intensity combat. He wouldn't be able to contribute significantly in a fight.

Bringing their horses, more than a dozen Nightwatchers rode swiftly towards Song Changfu's mansion.

...

"Ningyan, why did things turn out this way?"

Song Tingfeng's face was grim, filled with unease and anxiety.

As a Bronze Gong, he wasn't privy to the case's secrets. To Song Tingfeng and other Nightwatchers, the progress of the case seemed disjointed and abrupt.

After returning from an inspection, Xu Qi'an had solved the mystery, and Inspector Zhang had arrested Commander Yang Chuannan.

After Li Miaozhen visited the post, the case seemed to take a turn, but they still didn't know the specifics.

Then today, a group of escorts brought a crippled man. After the Inspector's secret interrogation, it turned out Governor Song was the mastermind.

Only just now did Xu Qi'an give a brief overview to the Nightwatchers, making everything clear.

Now aware of the case's progress and the current situation, Song Tingfeng needed time to process the sudden news.

"There's a saying that the battlefield changes in an instant. It's the same with investigations. The enemy won't wait for you to gather evidence step by step and prepare thoroughly before surrendering."

Xu Qi'an remained calm, given Jiang Lyuzhong's presence and the powerful Nightwatchers.

"Tingfeng, go out of the city immediately and find Li Miaozhen. Tell her everything that happened here."

To be safe, Xu Qi'an decided to seek help from the Flying Swallow Army. Li Miaozhen's private army was extremely powerful, consisting of martial experts from all over the country.

"Alright!"

Song Tingfeng got up and walked out but quickly returned, running upstairs. A few minutes later, he came down in commoner clothes.

*Smart...* Xu Qi'an secretly praised him while reflecting on his own oversight for not reminding him to change.

Song Tingfeng mounted a small mare that wouldn't get stuck in traffic and rode off.

But half an hour later, he galloped back, rushed into the post, and said with a grim face, "Ningyan, the city gates are closed."

... Xu Qi'an silently stared at him, feeling his heart sink to the bottom.

"I have a bad feeling about this."

Xu Qi'an couldn't sit still. He got up and started pacing in the hall.

"What could happen? Gold Gong Jiang is a fourth-rank martial artist. If thrown into the Jianghu, he would be a formidable hero. Moreover, our colleagues have also gone there," Song Tingfeng comforted.

He was also comforting himself, trying to boost his confidence.

Even with the power of the Great Feng, currently, there was only one third-rank martial artist, the Zhenbei King. A fourth-rank martial artist can indeed roam the Jianghu unchecked. Xu Qi'an had seen many fourth-rank experts in the capital, but that was the capital, the heart of the Great Feng.

Of course, the waters of the Jianghu are deep, and it could be hiding one or two old monsters deep beneath.

"The other three city gates must also be closed. Governor Song... or the Church of the Warlock God behind him, is clearly trying to trap us," Xu Qi'an paced back and forth, saying, “Have you thought about it? They must know that Gold Gong Jiang is fourth-rank, yet they still dare to act, which means they are fully prepared.

“They might have started plotting since they interrogated you and Guangxiao in the dream. We didn't lock onto Governor Song, so they could endure and stay put.

"But once we knew Governor Song was the mastermind, they would overturn the board without hesitation."

"And then?" Song Tingfeng's voice trembled, "Even if they kill the Inspector, aren't they afraid the court will send troops to annihilate them?"

"The Qi Clique and the Church of the Warlock God have been plotting for years, planning for this exact scenario," Xu Qi'an looked at him. "If not for rebellion, why would they go to such lengths?"

Song Tingfeng felt a bit panicked, but as a veteran Nightwatcher who had seen many storms, he wasn't completely lost.

"We must find a way to get the information out and mobilize the garrison troops," he said.

"The Inspector originally planned to have Gold Gong Jiang kill Xu Huchen and other officers tonight. They are lucky to have escaped."

Xu Qi'an grunted a response and then fell into deep thought.

Old Song was right. They needed to get the message out.

Yunzhou ultimately didn't belong to Song. Otherwise, the Qi Clique and the Church of the Warlock God wouldn't need to act so secretly. In Baidi City, at least, Yang Chuannan's garrison could contend with Governor Song.

*Governor Song framing Yang Chuannan might have also been to eliminate dissent... Misfortune lies where fortune rests...* Xu Qi'an thought of this possibility.

But Yang Chuannan was currently a prisoner, and his suspicion hadn't been cleared. Moreover, even if Xu Qi'an wanted to use him, injured Old Yang couldn't leave the city.

"What about breaking out of the city?" Zhu Guangxiao, who had been silent for a long time, suggested.

This route was very dangerous, but it was the only way he could think of.

"Currently, there are only four Bronze Gongs at the post. Facing hundreds of city guards, or even more, it's very challenging," Song Tingfeng shook his head, rejecting the idea.

The city guards weren't a disorganized mob; they were well-equipped, with crossbows and muskets. There were also probably some experts among them. Relying on just the four of them, even if they could break out of the city, it would take considerable effort.

*By the time they reached the barracks, informed the Flying Swallow Army, and fought their way back...* the chaos in Baidi City might already be over.

There was another way!

Xu Qi'an touched the small jade mirror in his pocket, feeling conflicted: *I really don't want to die socially...*

"I have a way to notify the Flying Swallow Army," Xu Qi'an said, then quickly added, "You don't need to ask more. Tingfeng and Guangxiao, you two stay at the post to guard Yang Chuannan and Liang Youping. If either of them makes any move, kill them immediately!"

"What do you mean by that?" Song Tingfeng was stunned.

"I have to get to the Inspector... I don't know why, but I have a bad feeling," Xu Qi'an said in a low voice.

After speaking, he left the post, grabbed a horse, and headed towards Governor Song's mansion.

The streets were bustling with people. The citizens were going about their usual activities, completely unaware of the impending upheaval.

But it had nothing to do with them. Whether Yunzhou changed rulers or not, they would continue their daily lives.

Xu Qi'an held the reins with one hand and took out a jade fragment with the other. He didn't directly message Number Two but first @ed Daoist Jinlian.

【THREE: Daoist Jinlian, have your injuries healed?】

He guessed that Daoist Jinlian's injuries should have healed by now. After all, it had been almost a month since he asked Luo Yuheng for medicine. If the injuries weren't healed by now, it would be too difficult.

【NINE: Thank you for your concern, I have long since recovered.】

"Phew..."

Xu Qi'an breathed a sigh of relief, considering it a small blessing amid the misfortune.

【THREE: Please block everyone else. I have urgent business to discuss with TWO.】

What's so secretive that Number Three needs to talk to Number Two alone?

The scattered members of the "Heaven and Earth Society," located all over the the world, watched the communication in the mirror with curiosity filling their chests.

But after waiting for a long time and finding no further messages from the fragments of the Earth Book, they realized their fragments had been temporarily blocked and couldn't receive any information.

This secret technique was only mastered by the Daoists of the Earth Sect. Back then, Daoist Zilian used the same method to block them all.

"This technique is so annoying!"

The Southern Barbarian Girl angrily threw the small jade mirror on the ground. With a "boom," the ground trembled, and the jade mirror embedded itself in the earth.

【NINE: THREE, you can speak now. No one can see your messages except me and TWO.】

*Have they disconnected from the network... Daoist, I actually didn't want you to see my messages either. Although you've been watching my moves coldly, the fewer people present during my social death, the better...* Xu Qi'an muttered to himself, slowing his horse's pace. Using his finger as a pen, he sent a message:

【THREE: TWO, Can you see this?】

Li Miaozhen, who was waiting, instantly replied to his message:

【What do you need to discuss with me?】

Using her sixth sense, she thought the matter might be related to his cousin, Xu Qi'an. Otherwise, one being in Yunlu Academy in the capital and the other in Baidi City, Yunzhou, separated by thousands of miles, what could there be to discuss?

【NINE: Do you need me to step back?】

【THREE: Yes, Daoist, thank you.】

【NINE: Heh, it seems to be an extremely important matter. Rest assured,  this poor Daoist won't spread it.】

*...Damn you!* Xu Qi'an's face went blank.

*Daoist, do you still like cats? If so, please keep that habit. I will definitely expose it in the future...* Xu Qi'an took a deep breath and sent a message:

【THREE: TWO, what I'm about to say is very important. You must not hesitate or question it. Once you hear me out, act immediately.】

*Also, don't pay too much attention to my social death. Old Xu still cares about face.*
