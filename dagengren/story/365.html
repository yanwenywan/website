# 365. White Horse, Silver Spear: Li Miaozhen

“Swish, swish…”

The Yao army in front of him retreated in unison, as if moved by some primal instinct. Yaoguai within the forest reacted similarly—some leaped back, others climbed trees in a reflexive panic.

A single golden body had frightened an entire horde.

The princess consort looked around in astonishment, seeing the Yao beasts that moments earlier had radiated temptation and ferocity now reduced to quivering cowards. Her delicate heart slowly settled, and the blood drained from her face returned, a newfound sense of safety washing over her in Xu Qi’an's presence.

This was no illusion. Since their northern journey began, this man had consistently given her a sense of security, easing her fears step by step.

Yet he could be infuriating too—always teasing her, targeting her vulnerabilities, dulling that comfort with his antics.

Still, amidst her tumultuous thoughts, two words surfaced in her mind: “Holy shit!”

Everyone knew this was a slang term expressing shock.

“Vajra Divine Art! Which sect of the Buddhist path are you from? Who is your master?”

The giant serpent raised its head high, its wide maw stretching open 180 degrees. Though it feigned ferocity, its demeanor betrayed inner fear, its eyes shifting from hunger to dread and resentment.

The surrounding Yao echoed its behaviour. Though initially startled into withdrawal, fear morphed into anger, and en-masse, they surged forward a short distance, baring their fangs and glaring at Xu Qi’an with violent intensity. Their bloodthirsty eyes seemed to accuse him of slaying their kin or stealing their mates.

*What’s this? The northern Yao fear Buddhism this much?* Xu Qi’an mused, sweeping his piercing gaze across the surrounding Yao. Like an embodiment of wrathful divinity, he silently called out in his mind:

“Master Shenshu, it’s mealtime. Come on out.”

“Master Shenshu?”

*...Oh, damn! Did Shenshu lose connection again? No way—I just topped up his VIP pass with four annual cards!* Xu Qi’an mentally griped, his rising anxiety thinly veiled as he calculated his next move. With Vajra Body at a minor achievement stage, he wasn’t afraid of this Yao horde. Escape alone? Feasible. Protecting the princess consort amidst a storm of claws and fangs? Not so much.

He needed information from the Yao leaders, but Shenshu’s absence left him in a tight spot.

Just then, the serpent hissed a command, “Eat him!”

The air erupted with cries as beasts charged. Rats squealed, baring strong incisors. Foxes snarled, their sharp fangs glinting. The black horse reared, snorting loudly, while great cats and other predators closed in with terrifying speed.

The princess consort shut her eyes, clutching Xu Qi’an's hand with trembling desperation.

At that moment, Shenshu’s voice echoed in Xu Qi’an’s mind: “I was lost in thought.”

*What could an empty head be reminiscing about?* Xu Qi’an lampooned, simultaneously exhaling in relief. Relinquishing control of his body, he replied internally, “Don’t kill them. I need information—this group is likely from the northern Yao clans. I want to know their target.”

In the next heartbeat, he lost control of his limbs.

“Do not hunt or kill.”

Shenshu’s gentle sigh reverberated through the valley. To the Yao, it was like thunder. Their bodies froze mid-action, tumbling down slopes, falling from trees, and crashing into each other. Chaos consumed the battlefield.

“A rabble,” Xu Qi’an commented.

“...” Shenshu remained silent.

“Hisss….” The serpent, pressed to the ground by an invisible force, struggled to lift its head. Only when fear entirely displaced its murderous intent did it regain control of its body—far later than its weaker brethren, who had surrendered their aggression earlier.

Just as the serpent prepared to issue a retreat, its pupils caught sight of a flickering golden figure. Before it could react, Xu Qi’an appeared before it. Terror exploded in the serpent’s heart. It dared not even consider self-destruction; such thoughts seemed absurd against a force as overwhelming as this.

A master of both martial arts and Zen—this monk's strength was unfathomable.

Xu Qi’an spoke deliberately: “I have questions. Answer truthfully.”

The immense pressure left the serpent trembling. With a quavering voice, it replied, “Please ask, Master.”

Regaining control of his body, Xu Qi’an took over, asking, “Why have the Northern Yao invaded the Great Feng in such numbers? What’s your goal?”

He had a strong suspicion of the answer.

“We... we’re not Northern Yao,” the serpent muttered.

A question mark flashed in Xu Qi’an's mind. The serpent hastily clarified, “We are citizens of the Wanyao Kingdom.”

*The remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom? The nation once ruled by the Nine-Tailed Fox?* Xu Qi’an nearly exclaimed in disbelief.

Fragments of information about this kingdom surfaced in his mind.

The Wanyao Kingdom had once dominated the Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Southern Marches. It was the southern branch of the Yao clans of Jiuzhou, ruled by the Nine-Tailed Fox.

Suspected to be a Half-step Martial God—this information came from Heaven and Earth Society’s Number Five, Lina. She once mentioned that during the Sixty-year extermination of the Yao, the Half-step Martial God of the Wanyao Kingdom forced the Buddha to act personally to kill him.

Afterward, the Wanyao Kingdom collapsed. The orphan of the Nine-Tailed Fox, the Nine-tailed Princess, fled with the remnants of her forces and began a five hundred year long resistance.

*For the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom to appear here is no coincidence. Could this mean that the Yao Princess also intends to involve herself in the quagmire of Chuzhou? … A third rank Martial Artist advancing to second rank has implicated so many major figures. Well, it does make sense…*

Xu Qi’an’s gaze turned cold as he said, “You still haven’t answered my question.”

“We secretly infiltrated Chuzhou. Once the Princess finds the location where the Zhenbei King carried out his Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles massacre, we will strike as one,” the giant serpent quickly replied, bowing its head in fear.

*She’s after the blood essence too? If you add the chief of the Qingyan Tribe of the northern barbarian clans into the mix, Chuzhou’s waters are truly murky.*

*The advantage is that I can exploit the chaos; I’m no longer fighting alone.*

*The downside is also obvious—none of these parties are trustworthy. Whoever obtains the blood essence will be bad news.*

*Hmm, I really want to get in touch with that Yao Princess, to ask if she has any leads… Xu Qi’an, Xu Qi’an, this is like negotiating with a tiger; you won’t even know how you died.*

As his thoughts raced, Xu Qi’an frowned and said, “You haven’t found the location where the Zhenbei King carried out his Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles massacre either?”

The giant serpent shook its head.

Xu Qi’an communicated inwardly with Master Shenshu, handing control of his body to him. Shenshu said calmly, “A serpent does not lie.”

Xu Qi’an asked again and received the same answer as before.

*So, the Wanyao Kingdom is looking for the site of the massacre, and the northern barbarians are also searching for it…* Xu Qi’an was astonished. Where exactly did the Zhenbei King slaughter the populace?

Chuzhou spanned eight thousand miles. Though vast, it shouldn’t be so well hidden.

“Master, I’ve asked everything I need to. You may act now,” Xu Qi’an said inwardly to the monk.

“Let them go.”

Unexpectedly, Master Shenshu did not slaughter the Yao to seize their blood essence.

“Why? With a great battle looming, wouldn’t it be wise to replenish your arm?” Xu Qi’an asked in surprise.

Master Shenshu chuckled and said, “I was reminded of the past. Before my cultivation reached its peak, the Wanyao Kingdom dominated the Southern Marches, powerful beyond comparison.

“That Yao Princess may recognise me—or at least, she’s likely heard of me.”

*Indeed, it was the remnants of the Wanyao Kingdom that destroyed Sangpo and placed Shenshu’s severed arm inside me… The Yao Princess must know of Shenshu. For Master Shenshu, whose memories are fragmented, seeking out contemporaries or past acquaintances is the best way to recover his past…* Xu Qi’an suddenly understood.

“Master, I understand your reluctance to offend the Yao Princess, but if we leave these Yao unchecked, they’ll prey on the common folk,” Xu Qi’an persisted.

“Humans are life; so are the Yaoguai. What’s the difference?” Shenshu asked calmly.

*This… Are you trying to debate philosophy with me?* Xu Qi’an was dumbfounded and unable to reply.

From a philosophical perspective, Shenshu’s words were correct. All lives are equal; no life is inherently superior or inferior.

From a personal perspective, Xu Qi’an was human. His loyalties lay unequivocally with humanity, and he saw no issue with this stance.

While he respected other forms of life and avoided wanton killing or cruelty, he had no hesitation in taking necessary actions, especially when the Yao were slaughtering humans.

But as a Buddhist master, Shenshu’s worldview was naturally different. Xu Qi’an did not think he could change the mindset of someone with transcendent cultivation.

Regaining control of his body, Xu Qi’an pondered for a moment and said, “I need a way to contact your Princess.”

“This…”

The giant serpent hesitated, looking troubled.

“Is that not possible?”

Xu Qi’an’s gaze turned sharp as a blade.

“The Princess is elusive. She contacts us; we cannot find her on our own.”

At this moment, the four-tailed white fox took the initiative to speak, explaining the situation.

*Sounds like she’s a top-level spy master…* Xu Qi’an noticed that Shenshu had no intention of intervening. He coldly swept his gaze over the Yao, his expression stern and voice commanding:

“Heaven cherishes all life. I will not kill you. But remember this well: while you are hidden in Chuzhou, you must not prey upon humans. If you do, I will ensure your complete annihilation.”

*ot sure whether such a threat would work… bloody hell…*

The giant serpent’s cold, vertical pupils glimmered with joy as it prostrated itself in submission, nodding repeatedly. “Rest assured, Master. We will not linger long in Chuzhou, and during our stay, we will hunt only wild beasts, not harm humans.”

The Yao army collectively adopted postures of submission and reverence.

Beside him, the princess consort glanced at Xu Qi’an’s profile, her eyes sparkling with admiration.

After gaining tacit approval from the enigmatic great master, the Yao forces resumed their march. They bypassed Xu Qi’an and the Princess, advancing in silence like a defeated mob.

…

The people of the Great Feng liked to refer to the northern tribes as "northern barbarians" and the southern tribes as "southern barbarians". However, the northern Yao appeared far less frequently in the speech of the Great Feng’s citizens than the northern barbarians.

This was because the lands bordering Chuzhou were largely under the control of the northern barbarians. The territory of the northern Yao shared extensive borders with the northeastern Church of the Warlock God, making them mortal enemies who frequently clash.

In this historical and geographic context, the northern Yao and the northern barbarians had become close allies, often sealing their alliance through marriage.

The northern barbarians consisted of nine tribes, each with at least three fourth rank experts. Compared to the Great Feng’s population, which numbered in the hundreds of millions, the population of the northern barbarians was pathetically sparse. However, as descendants of demons and gods, they possessed an overwhelming advantage in individual combat strength, capable of utterly crushing ordinary humans.

A hundred-strong barbarian raiding party encountering a thousand-strong Great Feng cavalry unit in the wilderness would invariably spell doom for the latter, assuming no cannons or ballistae were present.

Beyond Chuzhou’s border, the northern landscape turned rugged, dominated by grey-white or deep-black mountain ranges and barren lands with little vegetation.

Desolation was the north's defining theme.

Of course, there were also lakes, grasslands, thriving oases, and verdant hills. Most of these areas were occupied by the barbarian tribes and their branches, where they settle and thrive.

The Qingyan Tribe lay in the northwest, at the base of a mountain range called Tuotian. Legend has it that Tuotian Mountain was formed from the fallen body of the Qingyan Tribe's ancestor.

The mountain range was rich in resources—fruits, herbs, birds, and beasts abound—making it a sacred place for the Qingyan Tribe.

The Qingyan Tribe’s architectural style blended elements of northern and Great Feng design. Among the sprawling clusters of tents were adobe houses, wooden buildings, and even palatial structures—erected by slaves plundered from the Great Feng.

At dusk, the heavy sound of snoring, akin to muffled thunder, echoed throughout the Qingyan Tribe. The azure-skinned tribespeople were unfazed, busily herding cattle, hunting in the mountains, or drinking and feasting.

For the snoring to carry for dozens of miles—what sort of monster could produce such a sound?

The source of the snoring was none other than the Qingyan Tribe’s leader, Jili Zhigu.

A peak third rank expert and the strongest among the northern barbarians, Jili Zhigu once engaged in a deadly battle with the Zhenbei King. The outcome remained unknown, but the battlefield spanned hundreds of miles, leaving a wasteland devoid of life in its wake.

A barbarian with twin blades strapped to his back galloped through the village on horseback, speeding past tents and houses until he reached a road leading to the mountain's base. The road ended at a palace heavily influenced by the Great Feng’s architectural style.

The twin-bladed barbarian produced a token to pass through the checkpoint, entered the complex, and headed straight for the grandest palace.

“Chief! Chief!” the barbarian called out in his native tongue, standing in the courtyard outside the palace.

The snoring abruptly ceased. The massive twenty foot tall palace doors swung open on their own.

The twin-bladed barbarian stepped into the hall. The decor was crude but imposing—sixteen massive stone pillars supported the hundred foot high dome.

A crimson carpet stretched from the hall’s depths to the entrance, flanked by towering torches that burned brightly.

At the end of the hall sat an enormous stone chair. Upon it reclined a twenty foot tall azure giant.

The giant’s hairless body was covered in thick blue keratinous armour. From his forehead sprouted a skyward-curving horn.

Though he neither restrained his aura nor actively unleashed it, the mere presence of Jili Zhigu was enough to leave the twin-bladed barbarian trembling, his legs shaking uncontrollably.

Barbarian experts never bothered to conceal their strength, and thus Jili Zhigu had no guards or attendants in the hall.

A colossal sword, broader than a door, rested against the stone chair. Its surface was dull and mottled, stained with the blood of powerful adversaries.

The giant's half-closed eyes opened slightly. His thunderous voice reverberated through the hall: “Why do you disturb my slumber?”

The twin-bladed barbarian prostrated himself, pressing his forehead to the ground as he respectfully replied in barbarian tongue: “Chief, we’ve captured a prisoner who claims to know the location where the Zhenbei King slaughtered the living and refined their blood.”

The azure giant’s half-lidded eyes snapped open. A terrifying aura spread throughout the hall, filling every corner.

…

On the outskirts of Beishan County, not far from the border, a convoy made its way along the official road.

Leading the convoy was a woman clad in light armour, her hair tied in a high ponytail, wielding a silver spear.

Her features were delicate yet devoid of typical feminine softness. Her bright eyes and sharp features exuded a heroic charm. To call her beautiful would be an understatement; she was dashing.

In this era, such a strikingly valiant woman was a rarity.

White horse, silver spear; Li Miaozhen had resumed her old role. Lady Flying Swallow had returned to the Jianghu.
