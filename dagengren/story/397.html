# 397. To Jianzhou

Daoist Bailian was deeply curious about which martial experts Daoist Leader Jinlian had chosen as the holders of the Earth Book fragments. As one of the coloured lotuses, she ranked highly in the sect.
 
he knew some of the inside story—supposedly, Daoist Leader Jinlian had chosen young talents with great fortune. In the future, they would be crucial in helping him eradicate his inner demons.

But the problem was that these young talents were, after all, still young. No matter how strong they were, how strong could they really be?

Unless each of them was Rank Four, Bailian did not believe these youths could stand against the Earth Sect’s Lotus Daoists who had succumbed to demonic influence, let alone stop Daoist Leader Heilian or fend off the forces of the Wulin Alliance.

Yet, Daoist Leader Jinlian seemed to have great confidence in the “Earth Book Heaven and Earth Society” he had assembled.

*Across Jiuzhou, there are countless young prodigies, as numerous as carp crossing the river. It’s impossible to guess who Daoist Leader Jinlian has selected…* Bailian was both apprehensive and expectant.

…

Quanrong Mountain.

Deep in the night, Cao Qingyang, clad in a purple robe embroidered with golden cloud patterns, left the courtyard alone and headed towards the back mountain.

There, in the rear mountain, resided one who had lived as long as the nation itself.

The moonlight was dim, shadows of trees swayed, and the rustling of Cao Qingyang’s steps mingled with the sounds of the night as he tread the narrow mountain path. The hem of his robe brushed against the wild grass on the roadside.

Cao Qingyang was over forty years old, his features upright and dignified, his sharp gaze exuding authority. His very appearance embodied the word “righteous.”

Regarding this Alliance Leader, there was a well-known tale in Jianzhou’s jianghu—supposedly, the former Alliance Leader had been obsessed with physiognomy, the study of faces. One day, by chance, he encountered Cao Qingyang, who was then just a low-ranked follower in the Wulin Alliance.

The old leader was overjoyed, declaring that this man had an extraordinary face—one in ten thousand, a "Later Earth Aspect." Heaven is round, Earth is vast, and the land nurtures all things. Those with this aspect were virtuous and capable of leading heroes.

Thus, the former leader took him as a disciple, imparted his martial arts, and eventually passed the position of Wulin Alliance Leader to him.

Whether or not physiognomy was real, the former Alliance Leader’s judgment was undoubtedly sound. In terms of martial prowess, Cao Qingyang was Jianzhou’s foremost warrior, reigning supreme on the martial ranking.

As a leader, he had governed the Jianzhou Wulin Alliance for over a decade without making a critical mistake. The jianghu remained stable under his rule, and he even cooperated with the authorities in apprehending wanted criminals.

After trekking through the forest for fifteen minutes, his path suddenly opened up to a towering cliff face. At its base stood a massive stone gate.

The stone gate was tightly shut, covered in rotting leaves and overgrown with weeds, as though it had remained sealed for countless ages.

The moment Cao Qingyang stepped out of the forest and laid eyes on the cliff, he keenly sensed two red lantern-like lights glowing atop the precipice. They “scanned” him briefly before vanishing.

That was the Quanrong.

Cao Qingyang approached the stone gate, bent his back, and spoke in a steady, respectful voice: “Great Ancestor, I will obtain the Nine-Coloured Lotus Root for you and aid you in breaking through.”

There was no response from within.

Cao Qingyang continued, “Since the Battle of Shanhai Pass twenty years ago, the Great Feng has been in decline. The court’s control over the provinces has weakened drastically. Disasters have struck one after another, and I can sense that great chaos is coming.”

At last, an ancient, ethereal voice echoed from within: “Is the Emperor of Great Feng still pursuing the Dao?”

Cao Qingyang nodded. “Yes.”

“Hmph!”

A cold snort seeped through the stone gate’s cracks.

Cao Qingyang went on, “Recently, a message arrived from the capital. The Zhenbei King, in his pursuit of a breakthrough to second rank, slaughtered 380,000 civilians in Chuzhou City. He was then slain in Chuzhou by an unknown master.”

He briefly summarized the events.

“Well deserved!” the voice replied.

“Afterward, Emperor Yuanjing sought to cover up the crime, killing the Chuzhou Governor who had traveled to the capital to seek justice and shielding one of the main culprits, the Duke Protector of the Nation.”

“Did the court officials say nothing? Did the Jianzheng do nothing?” The voice grew deeper.

“They did nothing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Cao Qingyang felt the ground beneath him tremble slightly. Even the stone gate shuddered, causing dust to fall.

The red lanterns atop the cliff reignited, their cold glow fixed upon him.

“Calm your anger, Great Ancestor. There is more to the story…” Cao Qingyang hastily said.

The tremors ceased, and the two red lanterns atop the cliff were once again extinguished.

Cao Qingyang exhaled, his rigid, imposing face relaxing noticeably before continuing:

“Later, a Silver Gong stormed the imperial palace, captured the Duke Protector, denounced the Emperor’s crimes, and condemned the Zhenbei King’s massacre before executing both involved Dukes at the vegetable market.”

Inside the stone gate, silence lingered. After a long pause, a faint sigh drifted through: “Since ancient times, coarse men have been the most detestable, yet also the most blameless.”

Cao Qingyang pondered for a moment before explaining, “Ancestor, that Silver Gong did not die.”

“Oh?”

This time, the ancient voice carried a trace of curiosity.

“His name is Xu Qi’an, a Nightwatcher. He rose to prominence during last year’s official evaluation. If Ancestor wishes to hear the details, I can recount them for you—so long as you won’t find my chatter tiresome.”

A slight chuckle came from within. “I have secluded myself for centuries, knowing nothing of the outside world, nothing of the jianghu beyond these lands. Aside from hearing your occasional prattle, life is dull.”

Cao Qingyang then sat cross-legged before the stone gate and began recounting in detail:

“In recent years, the most interesting figure in the jianghu has been Lady Flying Swallow, while the most astonishing presence in court has been this Silver Gong, Xu Qi’an…”

He proceeded to narrate, step by step, Xu Qi’an’s meteoric rise.

The Wulin Alliance’s dominance over Jianzhou’s jianghu, its ability to make the authorities wary and the court tolerate its existence, was not merely due to its powerful martial artists or its formidable cavalry.

Rather, what Cao Qingyang prided himself on the most was the intelligence network he had built.

From street vendors to wandering swordsmen, this network, in his eyes, might not match the Nightwatchers’ shadow agents under Wei Qingyi, but when it came to grassroots intelligence, it was unparalleled.

He recounted this Silver Gong solving the tax silver case from within a prison cell, cutting down his superior in broad daylight, unraveling the Sangpo case, uncovering the Yunzhou conspiracy, and most recently, exposing the Chuzhou massacre.

Jianzhou had invested significant effort in studying Silver Gong Xu.

Of course, much of this was because his actions had been so earth-shattering and ostentatious that ignoring him was simply impossible.

The great ancestor behind the stone gate listened patiently, intrigued by the rise of this seemingly minor figure.

“Interesting, interesting. If this child does not die prematurely, the Great Feng will see the rise of yet another peak martial artist,” the aged voice remarked with amusement.

“There are rumors in the jianghu that his talent is on par with the Zhenbei King,” Cao Qingyang nodded, finding no fault with the assessment.

“Compared to the Zhenbei King, I would much rather see warriors like this Xu boy emerge,” the elder sighed.

“Martial artists defy laws with their strength. The more reckless they are, the purer their spirit, for their cultivation lies within themselves… The Zhenbei King was a pure martial artist, which allowed him to reach such heights, but it was also this purity that drove him to massacre a city. Thus, coarse men are the most detestable.

“This Xu boy… he too defies laws and acts by his own conscience. He slew his superior for the sake of an unrelated girl, he stood alone against… how many rebel soldiers?”

“He cut down over two hundred rebel soldiers,” Cao Qingyang recalled for a moment before answering.

“But you just said he stood alone against ten thousand rebels,” the ancient voice remarked.

…Cao Qingyang’s expression twitched slightly. He spoke in a steady tone, “Some say it was eight thousand, some say five thousand, others claim ten or even twenty thousand… there are too many versions of the story. I must have misremembered.”

The ancient voice let out a neutral “Hmm” before continuing, “In this Chuzhou massacre case, everyone feared imperial power and dared not speak out. Only he had the courage to stand forth, raging in defiance. That is why, since ancient times, coarse men have been the most blameless.”

Cao Qingyang bowed his head. “I will remember the Ancestor’s teachings.”

After a pause, he brought up the true purpose of his visit: “The Earth Sect’s Nine-Coloured Lotus is in Jianzhou. It will mature in a few days. I intend to seize the lotus root to aid you in breaking through.

“However, the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader has fallen into demonic ways and cannot be trusted. Your grand-disciple has one foot in Rank Three, but the other remains stuck no matter how hard I try to cross. I fear I cannot contend against the Earth Sect’s Daoist Leader alone. Please, Ancestor, lend me your aid.”

“The Daoist Sects of Heaven, Earth, and Man—every generation’s Daoist Leader has been second rank. How can I assist you?”

“Great Ancestor, what’s coming is merely an avatar, at most Rank Three,” Cao Qingyang clarified.

From the narrow crack in the stone gate, a single drop of crystalline blood seeped out and shot into Cao Qingyang’s forehead.

…

Morning light bathed the land, bringing with it a powerful warmth.

Xu Qi’an woke up right on time, his head heavy and groggy. He yawned, muttering to himself, “It’s been too long since I visited Fuxiang. I really miss her.”

After dressing neatly, he nudged Zhong Li, who was still curled up on the nearby couch, and gestured for her to get up and wash.

The two of them squatted under the eaves, each holding a pig-bristle toothbrush, their mouths full of foam as they brushed their teeth.

“The essence of a true top-tier artefact lies not in the formation imprinted upon it, but in the spirit within it,” Zhong Li suddenly remarked without preamble, tilting her head and staring at him in silence.

Xu Qi’an frowned. “If you have something to say, just say it. Do you expect me to read your mind?”

“Oh… oh…”

She gave two vague grunts, rinsed her mouth, and softly explained, “The blade that Teacher gave you—it has the form of a peerless divine weapon, but it lacks the corresponding spirit.”

Xu Qi’an’s heart stirred. “And?”

Zhong Li earnestly advised, her voice as delicate and soft as wind chimes beneath the eaves, “You must get the lotus seed. It can awaken your weapon’s spirit.

“A weapon with an awakened spirit becomes a true instrument of slaughter. The most powerful artefacts in Jiuzhou—like the Sovereign Sword and the Earth Book—all have spirits.

“In other words, having a spirit is the foundation of an artefact’s ascension to the highest tier. If the blade that the Jianzheng gifted you gains a spirit, even high-rank martial artists will no longer be invincible in front of it.”

*Right! Why didn’t I think of that? The lotus seed can awaken all things—it can surely awaken my blade as well…* Xu Qi’an’s heart pounded.

He quickly calculated. If the Black Gold Blade gained a spirit and combined with his one Blade from Heaven and Earth, then his strength would not merely be invincible within his rank—it might allow him to cut down enemies an entire realm above.

Once he truly advanced to Rank Five, he might even be able to slay Rank Four martial artists. Perhaps not peak Rank Four, but ordinary ones would not be difficult.

And if he reached Rank Four, wouldn’t his offensive techniques rank among the strongest of his peers?

What Xu Qi’an lacked the most now was true combat power, and his weapon was part of that strength.

Zhong Li rinsed her mouth and, in her soft voice, added, “Once the spirit is born, the blade will no longer be an inanimate object. If you nurture it daily, it will recognize you as its master—others won’t be able to wield it. You have a fragment of the Earth Book, so you should understand.”

*Zhong Li is brilliant…* Xu Qi’an was now determined to head to Jianzhou.

Feigning seriousness, he said in a deep voice, “How do you know I have an Earth Book fragment? How do you know I plan to safeguard the lotus seed? Have you been spying on my messages?”

“?” Zhong Li looked at him blankly.

Xu Qi’an wiped his mouth, then smeared the foam from his palm onto her head, turning her already messy hair into a proper bird’s nest.

He admired his handiwork with a gleeful grin.

“I… I need to wash my hair…”

Zhong Li cast him an innocent look, completely bewildered as to why she was being treated this way, and dejectedly walked away.

*Haha, if it were the Princess Consort, she’d have pounced on me and clawed my face by now…* Xu Qi’an let out a smug hmmph.

Just then, a familiar lurch struck him.

Xu Qi’an’s brows furrowed. He tossed aside his toothbrush and hurried back to his room, reaching under his pillow to grab the Earth Book fragment.

A message had arrived.

【NINE: Everyone, set out for Jianzhou immediately. The situation has taken a bad turn.】

Chu Yuanzhen responded at once:

【FOUR: What do you mean by ‘bad turn’? Daoist, what’s happening in Jianzhou?】

【NINE: It’s too complicated to explain in writing. There are a lot of enemies this time. The situation is dire. You all need to get here as soon as possible—we’ll talk in person.】

*A lot of enemies?* Xu Qi’an’s eyebrows shot up.

After Zhong Li’s insights, he was determined to get the lotus seed. It would grant him a peerless divine weapon—not just another pretty concubine.

“I have to leave immediately. I’ll take you back to Sitianjian first.” Xu Qi’an grabbed Zhong Li’s wrist and dashed out of the room.

Just then, he spotted Li Miaozhen stepping out of her room, her flying sword in hand. Susu was nowhere to be seen, likely stored in her soul pouch.

“I’m taking her back to Sitianjian,” Xu Qi’an said.

“Alright.” Li Miaozhen nodded.

With Zhong Li’s misfortune magnetism, she had to be careful even in ordinary times—let alone on a battlefield.

Mounting his little mare, he took Zhong Li back to Sitianjian. Just as he was about to reunite with Li Miaozhen, a bold idea flashed through his mind.

Yang Qianhuan was a Rank Four Arcanist. His offensive skills were not as refined as a martial artist’s, but his formation mastery and artefacts were formidable…

Xu Qi’an saw Zhong Li descending the stone steps, about to vanish from view. He quickly called out, “Senior Sister Zhong, is Senior Brother Yang down there?”

Zhong Li turned her head. “Yes.”

“Senior Brother Yang? Senior Brother Yang?” Xu Qi’an bellowed down the stairs, his voice echoing loudly.

“Shut up! What do you want?” Yang Qianhuan’s displeased voice rang out.

“I need your help with something—”

Before Xu Qi’an could finish, Yang Qianhuan interrupted, “Not helping. Get lost.”

Xu Qi’an turned helplessly to Zhong Li, who merely shook her head, indicating she couldn’t do anything about it.

After a moment’s thought, Xu Qi’an sighed and raised his voice:

“I go now, to stand alone against a thousand foes! I go now, to slay villains and shake the jianghu! I go now, to the sacred land of martial arts—Jianzhou—where I will say just one thing to all gathered: ‘You are all trash.’”

The next instant, a white shadow flashed before his eyes.

Yang Qianhuan appeared, hands behind his back, and said in a deep voice, “Let’s go.”
