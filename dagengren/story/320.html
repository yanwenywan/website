# 320. Alone Halting the Many Servants (Long)

“Fifty-fifty?”

Lin'an batted her charming eyes and exclaimed in surprise, “Running Dog, you sure are quite confident.”

Then, with a quick, mischievous glance at Huaiqing, she scoffed, “If you wanted to enter the palace, you could’ve just come to me. Why bother bringing some irrelevant people along?”

“Growing bolder these days, I see.” Huaiqing nodded and stepped forward.

Usually, Lin'an would jump in fright at this point, hop like a little rabbit, and make her escape. But this time, she stood her ground, proudly puffed out her small chest, put her hands on her hips, and boldly challenged Huaiqing with a crisp voice, “So what? Did *we* say anything wrong?”

Xu Qi’an discreetly positioned himself between the two princesses, forcing a wry smile as he said, “Your Highnesses, please don’t quarrel. We’re surrounded by outsiders. Let’s not become a laughing stock.”

*Are you not an outsider yourself?* Huaiqing gave him a slight sideways glance.

The statue-like Huaiqing, with her well-developed figure and ice-cold goddess-like demeanour, frowned slightly, realizing the rapidly intensifying relationship between Silver Gong Xu Ningyan and Lin'an.

For instance, when Xu Qi’an intervened between them, he instinctively had his back to Lin'an, facing her instead—a protective gesture toward the former. Not to mention, when they arrived together, Lin'an walked very close to Xu Ningyan, violating the etiquette typically observed between a princess and her subject.

It was clear: Xu Ningyan was gradually gravitating toward Lin'an. This discovery stirred an inexplicable irritation within Huaiqing, leaving her feeling deeply unsettled.

“Didn’t we ask you previously about your plan for handling this case?” Huaiqing said. “At the time, you refrained from answering because you weren’t sure. But now, you’ve taken all necessary steps, leaving success to fate.”

Redirecting the conversation to avoid any further quarrel, Xu Qi’an saw he’d caught the attention of both princesses. Smiling, he continued:

“At first, my concern was how to prove Erlang’s innocence, to show he hadn’t committed any fraud, and I racked my brain over it. But later, I realised that his innocence doesn’t even matter.”

Xu Xinnian was simply a tool—a pretext, or rather, a weapon wielded by the civil officials for political machinations.

To put it plainly, Xu Erlang was the sacrificial pawn in a game of political strife.

Therefore, the crux of the issue, the key to breaking the deadlock, lies in ‘political strife.’ Only by winning this battle can Erlang hope for a fair trial.

Otherwise, would an individual without any allies at court really have their innocence acknowledged?

Huaiqing nodded slightly and said, “What you need is an ally capable of prevailing in the court’s power struggle. That’s the challenge here.

“As a student of Cloud Deer Academy, he’s destined to be a drifting weed without roots. It’s already a blessing if the many officials don’t kick him while he’s down; there’s no chance they’d actively side with him.

“If Duke Wei were to intervene, even the neutral officials would get involved. No one wants to see Duke Wei aligning with Cloud Deer Academy. Prime Minister Wang likely wouldn’t ignore such a move.”

These underlying intricacies were clear to Huaiqing. The issue troubling her was the word “ally.”

Without Wei Yuan, how could Xu Qi’an possibly identify a faction powerful enough to counter the Left Censor-in-Chief, Minister Sun, the Duke of Cao, and Deputy Minister Qin?

All his confidence, at its core, rested on Wei Yuan alone.

*In this game, the Emperor Yuanjing is merely the referee… As long as he doesn’t directly target Erlang, I can still give it a shot…* Xu Qi’an thought to himself.

…

The officials filed into the Jinluan Hall, maintaining silence. After a quarter of an hour, Emperor Yuanjing made his delayed entrance.

With his jet-black hair restored, the elderly emperor wore a simple Daoist robe, his long sleeves floating elegantly—more a Daoist than a sovereign.

After the regular proceedings, Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law suddenly stepped forward and declared, “Your Majesty, this subject has a petition to present.”

In an instant, all eyes focused on the red-robed figure before them. The previously stagnant atmosphere within the court now surged with concealed currents, eddies swirling among the gathered officials.

Ripples of tension swelled, passing between factions within the assembly.

The pre-show had ended, the main event was about to begin.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong and Deputy Minister Qin Yuandao, who had orchestrated this matter, straightened their postures, exuding an intense aura of resolve and confidence.

The factions backing this cause—such as the High Court Minister and his clique—smirked in anticipation, eager for the show to begin, but also eager to exact revenge on Xu Qi’an and Wei Yuan.

Prime Minister Zhao Tingfang’s faction, isolated and outnumbered, furrowed their brows.

Under normal circumstances, they would be unperturbed by such provocations, unfazed by Deputy Minister Qin. However, now that the Deputy Minister had entered the court wielding “momentum,” he bound the Prime Minister to the students of Cloud Deer Academy. To exonerate the Prime Minister would equate to clearing Xu Xinnian, pitting them against a formidable array of adversaries.

Inside and out, the remaining neutral factions watched the scene unfold in tacit agreement, their stance naturally inclined toward Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law, not toward Cloud Deer Academy.

“My Lord, speak.” Emperor Yuanjing sat high on the dragon throne, his presence grand.

“Under Your Majesty’s edict, your servant investigated the case of Prime Minister Zhao Tingfang accepting bribes and leaking examination topics to Xu Xinnian. Today, the truth is clear, and the facts have come to light. The parties involved are three: Xu Xinnian, a student of Cloud Deer Academy; Prime Minister Zhao Tingfang; and his steward, who served as the intermediary.

“Furthermore, according to Xu Xinnian’s own account, he became acquainted with the Prime Minister through his brother, Xu Qi’an.”

Minister Sun concluded his report.

The corresponding testimony had already been presented to the emperor for review in advance. Anything discussed at court had its memorial submitted a day prior.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong shifted slightly, his expression impassive as he cast a brief glance at Wei Yuan.

The other officials also turned their gazes toward Wei Yuan, awaiting his response. Minister Sun’s move was a bold play, directly dragging Wei Yuan into the fray, forcing him to engage rather than remain a bystander.

“Your Majesty, if your servant may speak.” 

Just then, an elderly censor with graying hair stepped forward—none other than Zhang Xingying, who had rendered meritorious service in Yunzhou.

Emperor Yuanjing’s response remained unchanged, his voice deep: “Speak, my Lord.”

Casting a quick glance at Minister Sun, Zhang Xingying declared loudly, “Your Majesty, I wish to accuse the Minister of Law Sun Min, of abusing his authority to force confessions under torture. I request that Your Majesty order a trial by the Three Courts and reopen the examination fraud case.”

This was a classic tactic in the court: the stalling strategy!

The final outcome of this maneuver ultimately depends on the Emperor’s will.

“Is that all?” Minister Sun sneered, retorting, “This case was personally commanded by His Majesty, with joint oversight by both the Ministry of Law and the Prefecture Office. How could there be any forced confessions?

“Those three suspects are still detained. If there’s any sign of forced confessions, His Majesty can have someone investigate.”

The Emperor nodded slowly and, without sparing another glance at Censor Zhang, asked, “My Lords, what do you think should be done about this case?”

Zhang Xingying stood there, disheartened.

Minister Sun glanced back at Prefect Zhang, his gaze tinged with slight disdain. Was that weak rebuttal meant to signal surrender?

At the same time, he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of disappointment. The Emperor’s stance was clear: stalling wouldn’t work, but he also hadn’t immediately passed judgment on the case.

The Emperor was granting Wei Yuan and Zhao Tingfang’s clique a chance to retaliate.

But Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong, who had been eager to drag Wei Yuan into the fray, suddenly perked up and stepped forward, bowing.

“Your Majesty, your servant believes that this case is exceedingly severe. After days of scrutiny, the entire capital is aware, and students are seething with resentment, while the common folk are outraged. If we don’t handle it strictly, we’ll fail to appease the public.”

At this moment, the High Court Minister stepped forward, shaking his head, “But that Xu Qi’an just performed meritorious deeds on behalf of our Sitianjian; we cannot simply discard him.”

This was a deliberate attack on his character, intended to portray Xu Qi’an as arrogant and complacent because of his achievements—something the Emperor couldn’t ignore. If he didn’t take action, it would only reinforce the idea of Xu Qi’an as an unruly figure, setting a terrible example.

Zhao Tingfang’s clique immediately stepped forward to refute him.

The other officials waited, astonished, when they realized Wei Yuan wasn’t speaking up, nor did any of his censors raise their banners.

Was he planning to abandon his trusted Xu Qi’an?

Thoughts raced through the minds of the officials as the winds began to shift. An official from the Ministry of Personnel stepped forward and cautiously spoke up:

“The High Court Minister’s point is valid. This case must be handled severely and without leniency; otherwise, the court’s authority, and Your Majesty’s, will be compromised.”

In an instant, officials from the Six Ministries began stepping forward to support the High Court Minister’s view.

Without yet voicing his opinion, Assistant Minister of War Qin Yuandao turned to look at the Duke of Cao.

Now that the civil officials had taken a stance, the Duke of Cao, a noble of the highest rank, could intensify matters. If he added his support, the Emperor would have no reason to oppose such a powerful alliance just to defend a single academic.

The Duke of Cao stepped forward, drawing the attention of the surrounding ministers and nobles.

It was clear he’d helped fuel the fires in the “exam fraud scandal” and, by publicly supporting it, could now solidify the alliance. *If he acts on behalf of the nobles, Wei Yuan will find it nearly impossible to regain control of the situation—an outcome that might not matter much in terms of Xu Xinnian’s fate, but it would sow an irreparable rift between Wei Yuan and Xu Qi’an… t*he ministers thought to themselves.

Once the Duke of Cao was standing alongside Minister Sun, he bowed.

“Your Majesty, your servant believes that the Ministry of Law and the Prefecture Office have handled this case too hastily. Senior Academic Official Zhao Tingfang is known for his integrity; why would he accept bribes?

“Moreover, although Xu Xinnian is but a student, the Cloud Deer Academy has not seen a huiyuan in years. Handling this case so quickly—would the great scholars of the academy sit idly by?”

In short, the Duke of Cao was saying that Xu Xinnian was a student that Cloud Deer Academy valued highly, and in dealing with him, they should consider the academy’s position and proceed cautiously.

Minister Sun’s head turned slowly, disbelief etched on his face as he stared at the Duke of Cao.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong and Assistant Minister of War Qin Yuandao’s expressions shifted. Before filing their impeachment, the two had discussed this at length. the Duke of Cao had even taken the initiative to offer his support, throwing the nobles behind their cause.

It was a carefully orchestrated alliance to strike together.

At this moment, Yuan Xiong and Qin Yuandao felt the anger of someone “betraying the revolution.”

*How could this be!?*

The many officials in the palace could not hide their shocked expressions, *the Duke of Cao has turned coat? Then what’s the point of pushing the tide…*

Stunned, the officials turned their gaze toward Wei Yuan.

*When did Wei Yuan win the Duke of Cao over? What promise had he made?*

Just then, Wei Yuan turned his head, visibly surprised as he glanced at the Duke of Cao.

*Wei Yuan seems surprised, does he not know either…* This subtle detail left the ministers even more puzzled.

For a moment, the atmosphere in court grew tense, shrouded in intrigue.

Most ministers fell silent, choosing to observe the situation as it unfolded.

But the Assistant Minister of War could no longer hold back. He stepped forward and declared in a solemn voice:

“Your Majesty, the Duke of Cao’s remarks are deeply concerning. If we go easy on Xu Xinnian simply because he is a student of Cloud Deer Academy, what would the scholars of the Imperial Academy think? What would all the scholars across the nation think?

“Long ago, Emperor Wenzu established the Imperial Academy, expelling Cloud Deer Academy students from the court. Why? Because Cloud Deer scholars defied the throne and disrupted the law.

“Lesser Sage Cheng engraved a monument at Cloud Deer Academy, bearing the words, ‘Serve with loyalty and righteousness, honour the Emperor with heroic deeds that will echo through the ages.’ It was to instruct future generations on how to be loyal and patriotic.

“Are any of you willing to let Emperor Wenzu’s helplessness repeat itself?”

The Emperor narrowed his eyes, his placid demeanour giving way to that of a ruler wielding power.

Impressive!

Minister Sun and the High Court Minister smirked slightly. This clever twist of the narrative drew a line through the court, with Imperial Academy scholars on one side and Cloud Deer Academy on the other.

A conflict of doctrines—how to choose?

Now, any official who spoke for Xu Xinnian would have to consider their own standing, contemplating whether their words would alienate them from the court and the officials.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong almost chuckled with satisfaction. This move would force Wei Yuan’s hand, as only he—a non-scholar—could tackle this without concern for academic allegiances.

If Wei Yuan was drawn into the fray, how would Prime Minister Wang respond? And what of the neutral civil officials?

Dragging Wei Yuan into the mess and then crushing him with momentum, forcing him to concede and surrender control of the Censorate, was a key part of Yuan Xiong’s recent plans.

“Hmph!”

Just then, a cold huff filled with boundless fury rang out in the hall.

Everyone turned toward the sound, only to see it was the usually unremarkable King Yu, who strode forward wearing his dark yellow, dragon-patterned robe. His face was grim, with grey at his temples and deep crow’s feet etched around his eyes, lending him an exceptionally aged appearance.

Seeing King Yu step forward, the fervour in Assistant Minister of War Qin Yuandao’s heart instantly sank.

“Two hundred years ago, not once did we hear of a Cloud Deer Academy scholar attempting to harm a princess. Is this the ‘loyalty and patriotism’ preached by you scholars from the Imperial Academy?”

King Yu rebuked loudly, “Hypocrites!”

He then turned to Emperor Yuanjing and bowed. “Your Majesty, as for the truth behind the examination scandal, your servant-brother cares not. I simply believe that the Ministry of Law officials are a disgrace, wallowing in incompetence.

“If they knew how to handle cases, would my poor Pingyang have died with such greviance? If not for the Nightwatcher’s Silver Gong Xu Qi’an’s thorough investigation, her injustice might have remained buried to this day.

“This scandal is of grave consequence; I hope Your Majesty orders a retrial, jointly handled by the Three Courts and the Nightwatchers.”

Emperor Yuanjing frowned, momentarily silent.

King Yu immediately burst into tears. “Your Majesty, my poor Pingyang…”

*Shameless!*

Minister Sun of the Ministry of Law, the Minister of the High Court, Left Censor-in-Chief, the Assistant Minister of War, and others turned pale. The case of Princess Pingyang’s death was a sensitive issue between the civil officials and Emperor Yuanjing.

The Assistant Minister of War had informed Emperor Yuanjing of the unruliness of Cloud Deer Academy scholars. Now, King Yu was suggesting that Imperial Academy scholars also harbor treacherous intentions toward the royal family—and would act on them.

Wei Yuan smiled inwardly. The fact that that kid could seek King Yu’s help was expected. But as to the reason why the Duke of Cao switched sides, although he had a vague guess, he could not confirm it yet.

Xu Ningyan might lack experience in factional struggles, but his keen insight saw the situation clearly.

At this moment, the Duke of Cao and the other nobility chimed in, standing faintly opposed to the civil officials.

Prime Minister Wang watched coldly but was secretly taken aback. Even he hadn’t anticipated that the situation would pit the nobles directly against the civil officials.

the Duke of Cao and King Yu were not allies, and neither were these two aligned with Wei Yuan, but their joint stand was an undeniable fact.

*Who was manipulating events from the shadows?*

This hidden strategist seemed to have a clear grasp of their opponents and was able to devise strategies, aligning with forces capable of countering their adversaries.

*King Yu… the case of Princess Pingyang… Could it be him?* A guess flashed through the Prime Minister’s mind, and his expression subtly changed before returning to normal.

The situation had taken a drastic turn, and Minister Sun’s heart skipped a beat. Should a retrial proceed and the Nightwatchers join in, all their efforts and schemes would be for naught.

It would lead to protracted disputes and a deadlock.

While Xu Xinnian might be barred from participating in the final palace examination, who cared if a mere huiyuan missed it?

Minister Sun, a core figure of the Wang Clique, repeatedly cast pleading looks at the Prime Minister.

*Big brother, what are you doing? We’re on the front lines, fighting for our lives, while you’re saying nothing back there?*

The Prime Minister noted Minister Sun’s look and frowned. From his perspective, the outcome of the case mattered little. Firstly, Wei Yuan hadn’t intervened; secondly, Xu Xinnian couldn’t represent the entirety of Cloud Deer Academy.

If he became troublesome, he could simply be reassigned to a remote corner.

But Minister Sun, as a key figure of the Wang Clique, had waded into the fray. If he stood by silently, it would damage morale. Such were the inevitable entanglements of cliques.

Oftentimes, one was simply not at liberty to act.

“Your Majesty, your servant has a method to quickly resolve this case,” the Prime Minister stepped forward, bowing as he slowly suggested.

“As for whether Grand Academician Zhao Tingfang leaked the questions, we need only test Xu Xinnian. Your Majesty can summon him here and examine him in poetry in front of the lord at court.

“If his famous ‘Ode to the Difficult Road’ was truly his own work, we shall see it immediately. And as for his comprehension of the classics, with the final examination approaching, Your Majesty can determine his true talents after reviewing his essays personally.

“If he is indeed a fraud, then it confirms both the leak and the corruption. He should be severely punished.”

Emperor Yuanjing looked at the Prime Minister for a moment, then smiled. “Well reasoned. We shall follow my Lord’s advice.”

Minister Sun and the others smiled broadly. Though the Prime Minister’s words seemed impartial, his stance was clear.

Having the emperor himself test Xu Xinnian’s poetry skills would require him to compose verse before the officials. In the entire nation, only Xu Qi’an, the “Poetry Champion,” was capable of such a feat.

If Xu Xinnian couldn’t pass this test, how could he face the palace exam?

King Yu immediately argued, “Your Majesty, this approach is too hasty. Such a legendary work could not be produced at will.”

Zhang Xingying quickly agreed.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong laughed and said, “The constraints of time apply just the same on an examination. If Huiyuan Xu could create one such masterpiece, why can he not compose a second?”

“King Yu’s argument is flawed. Xu Xinnian’s ability to produce timeless work demonstrates his prowess in poetry. When he composes another verse here, the truth will be plain for all to see.”

“Your Majesty, this is an excellent approach.”

The Six Chambers’ officials first voiced their support, followed closely by the rest of the civil officials.

the Duke of Cao remained silent; he had only agreed to ensure a light punishment for Xu Xinnian, not to exonerate him.

King Yu’s expression darkened as he prepared to continue his protest, but Emperor Yuanjing waved him off. “Our decision is made, King Yu. You need not speak further.”

…

A stick of incense later, a guard, clad in armor, stepped into the Golden Hall and respectfully announced, “Your Majesty, Xu Xinnian has been brought.”

The previously tense atmosphere suddenly became animated, and the court officials straightened, their spirits revived.

Emperor Yuanjing nodded, his voice stern, “Bring him in.”

The guard withdrew, and a few minutes later, the spring examination’s top scorer, Xu Xinnian, dressed in prison garb and possessing strikingly refined features, entered the hall.

Slowly, he walked down the scarlet carpet laid out between the assembled officials, advancing toward Emperor Yuanjing.

*This… Is this the famed Jinluan Hall?*

*Is this where the court officials hold their morning discussions?*

*Why was I summoned here…?* A cascade of questions swirled through Xu Xinnian’s mind as excitement surged within him, his hands and feet trembling slightly with anticipation.

In a low murmur, he cast a calming buff upon himself. “Remain unshaken before a landslide!”

In an instant, Xu Erlang’s heart stilled like undisturbed water, calm and unwavering, his gaze unclouded as though he held the gathered officials in no regard.

He bowed deeply. “Student Xu Xinnian greets Your Majesty.”

The guard stepped forward at once. “Your Majesty, his identity has been verified.”

The Emperor Yuanjing scrutinized the young man with a face so striking it defied reason, giving a slight nod as he spoke in a deep tone:

"We ask you—did the Grand Academician of the Eastern Pavilion accept bribes to leak the examination questions to you?"

Xu Xinnian raised his voice, declaring, "Your Majesty, I am innocent!"

Ignoring his plea, the Emperor interrupted in an indifferent tone, "We will give you one chance. If you wish to prove your innocence, compose a poem here in Jinluan Hall. I shall personally choose the topic. Xu Xinnian, do you dare?"

*I don't dare, I don't dare...* Xu Xinnian's face paled slightly.

He hadn't expected that, after being brought to Jinluan Hall, he would face such a challenge.

"Ode to the Difficult Road" had been ghostwritten by his elder brother, not his own creation. Although he had changed two words, and could still proudly claim, "This poem is mine," being asked to compose another one on the spot—he simply wasn't capable.

*To pull off something like that would require a saintly presence…* Inwardly, Xu Xinnian felt utter despair, even considering confessing everything and hoping the court would show leniency.

But reason reminded him that if he admitted "Ode to the Difficult Road" wasn't his work, he would be dragged into a chasm with no escape.

*What should I do, what should I do? Is this first time in Jinluan Hall really my last?* He fully grasped now the peril and intrigue of officialdom.

*Big Brother, what should I do…*

Xu Xinnian's expression, the changes in his complexion—everything was visible to the watching officials and to the Emperor.

Minister Sun's eyes flashed with satisfaction. Xu Qi’an’s poem had once nailed him to the pillar of shame, but now the tide had turned, and it was time for payback.

Qin Yuandao, Assistant Minister of War, exhaled silently, feeling that the outcome was certain. With Zhao Tingfang toppled, his next step would be to manoeuvre for the Eastern Pavilion academic position.

With the Cabinet under Prime Minister Wang, and Minister Sun being a core member of the Wang Clique, it was all but assured.

Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong cast a glance toward Wei Yuan, frustrated by his lack of intervention. Although it dampened his plans, losing one of Wei Yuan’s valuable aides wasn’t a complete loss.

*Things have really come to this…* Wei Yuan sighed inwardly. Initially, he thought Xu Xinnian’s involvement in the examination scandal was manageable. Later, when Xu Qi’an confessed to ghostwriting the poem, Wei Yuan advised him:

Seek leniency in sentencing.

It was a fatal flaw.

*Xu Ningyan seems to have something else up his sleeve; he hasn’t said so, but I can feel it…* Wei Yuan speculated, but had no clue how Xu Xinnian would handle composing a poem on the spot.

From his high seat, Emperor Yuanjing gazed down at Xu Xinnian, his voice stern and solemn, "Do you not dare?"

Gulping, Xu Xinnian swallowed his nerves. Whether he stepped forward or stepped back, he would face the blade either way. Gritting his teeth, he declared, "Your Majesty, please assign the topic."

The Emperor's smile was faint as he said calmly, "Loyalty and sacrifice to serve one's ruler—yes, compose a poem on 'Loyalty and Patriotism.' You have one incense stick's worth of time."

Hearing the Emperor’s topic, Minister Sun and several others couldn’t help but smirk.

The Emperor knew that Xu Xinnian was a scholar of Cloud Deer Academy, yet he chose such a topic—clearly, it was intentional.

Moreover, the great works on loyalty and patriotism throughout history were often written in times of national crisis. In times of peace, few memorable works had been composed on this theme.

It was a challenging topic!

*A poem on loyalty and patriotism…* Xu Xinnian stood there, stiff and motionless.

On that fateful day, his brother had drawn two topics, one on "Aspirations," the other on "Patriotism." The aspiration-themed poem had served him well in the metropolitan exam, securing him the title of huiyuan.

So, the poem on patriotism had remained unused.

He never imagined that the Emperor’s topic would match so precisely—a poem on loyalty and patriotism.

*Could it be… Could it be that… His Majesty and my elder brother have conspired together? Otherwise, how could such a coincidence occur?*

The Emperor's impassive gaze fell upon the Spring Examinations' Huiyuan. Observation was a skill the Emperor had mastered since his princely days. 

Xu Xinnian’s expressions, his eyes—all revealed his inner fear and despair, rendering him as motionless as wood.

King Yu, having walked a similar path as a young prince, cleared his throat and spoke solemnly, "Your Majesty…"

"King Yu!"

Qin Yuandao, Assistant Minister of War, interrupted loudly, saying, "The time for one incense stick is limited; don't distract Xu Xinnian. The officials are all waiting."

King Yu's face darkened.

The expressions of the officials varied—some looked worried, others amused, some smiled coldly, and others watched indifferently.

In the midst of this silence, Xu Xinnian suddenly raised his voice, declaring, “No need for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. This student thanks His Majesty for granting him the chance. My elder brother, Xu Qi’an, is the Empire’s foremost poet and composes verses at the snap of a finger.

"Naturally, I won't disgrace him."

*Hmm?!*

The sudden confidence took the court by surprise, from the Emperor down to the officials and King Yu.

Then, in a sonorous and rhythmic voice, he recited:

“*Black clouds weigh on crumbling walls, The flash of armour like golden scale.*”

With that short line, the minds of all were drawn to a vivid image of battle—a relentless enemy, like dark clouds, looming over the city; atop the walls, soldiers stood at the ready, their armour glinting in the sunlight.

Xu Xinnian looked back, his gaze sweeping over the gathered officials as he recited:

“*The sound of horns cry o'er autumn plains, Blood on the fortress making purple trails.*”[^1]

The noblemen stood stunned. Though this scholar had never seen a battlefield, how did he describe it so intimately, so strikingly?

“*Red banners half-furled o'er the River Yi, The heavy frost making drum-beats fail.*”

"What a line, 'The heavy frost making drum-beats fai!' This takes me back to my days guarding the borders, swathed in iron and blood," exclaimed the Marquess of Weihai, entranced in the imagery.

The other nobles, too, were lost in the magic of the verse.

The civil officials, on the other hand, frowned, glancing disdainfully at the crude warriors who interrupted the poem with their exclamations.

Minister Sun looked to Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong, who glanced at Assistant Minister of War Qin Yuandao, whose face darkened as he turned to the Minister of the High Court.

The four exchanged silent glances, their hearts sinking.

The High Court Minister said gravely, “This poem… is indeed quite fine, but what does it have to do with loyalty to the sovereign? You merely write about war and the battlefield. A Huiyuan who cannot even align his work with the given theme—what else can this be but cheating?”

“Precisely!” Qin Yuandao echoed loudly.

Ignoring them, Xu Xinnian turned sharply, bowed to Emperor Yuanjing, and spoke in a resounding voice that filled the hall:

“*For the Emperor's grace atop the golden tower, With dragon-sword in hand, I welcome death's veil!*”

The High Court Minister’s breath caught as he stared, feeling an invisible slap across his face; anger flared within him. Minister Sun and others, faces dark with fury, veins bulging, shared a similar reaction.

“For the Emperor's grace atop the golden tower, With dragon-sword in hand, I welcome death's veil…” Emperor Yuanjing savoured these words, his expression slowly turning into a broad smile, his heart brimming with satisfaction.

“Excellent poem, excellent poem. A worthy Huiyuan, and as expected of the talent who wrote ‘Ode to the Difficult Road’.”

His tone and expression left no doubt—His Majesty was in excellent spirits.

Pausing, Emperor Yuanjing asked, “But tell me, what does this ‘golden tower’ mean?”

*The golden tower… must be a high tower clad in gold…* Xu Xinnian bowed and offered his interpretation. “In my loyalty to Your Majesty, I am willing to give my life; not only a golden tower, but even a jade one would be within my grasp.”

Emperor Yuanjing nodded slowly, his smile deepening. “Well said. The court has always been clear on matters of rewards and punishment, and we have never wronged those who serve us well. We, too, abide by this.”

He continued, “Huiyuan Xu’s poetic talent is not inferior to his brother’s. The work *Ode to the Difficult Road* is indeed your own. As for your essays and thesis, we will personally review them during the palace examination. Do not disappoint us.

“Should you place within the second class, we are prepared to appoint you to the Hanlin Academy as a Junior Scholar.”

The Hanlin Academy, also known as the “nurturing ground of prime ministers,” granted even a junior scholar, albeit lower than a first-class scholar, qualifications for future entry into the cabinet—one of the most esteemed positions of the court.

Wei Yuan and Prime Minister Wang, one glancing to the left and the other to the right, simultaneously glanced at Xu Xinnian.

Xu Xinnian, relieved, suppressed his joy and replied, “Thank you, Your Majesty.”

Emperor Yuanjing declared, “We are weary. Court dismissed.”

It was over. The cheating scandal surrounding the imperial examination had come to a near-conclusive end.

Unless Xu Xinnian performed poorly in the imperial examination, an unlikely prospect given his standing as a student of Cloud Deer Academy and the top scorer in the metropolitan exams, this scandal would have no further repercussions.

The key factor was that His Majesty appeared to appreciate the young scholar, which was the crux of the matter.

The assembly, with faces full of mixed emotions, did not expect the case to conclude this way.

*Trying to catch the thief but losing face in the end…* Minister Sun’s expression soured. After the palace examination concludes, the case will be officially closed, and opportunists were bound to pounce on him for abuse of power and slander.

The members of the Six Ministries, the Supervisory Offices, and other high-ranking officials felt a collective sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction.

This discontent only heightened when they heard Emperor Yuanjing’s promise to admit Xu Xinnian into the Hanlin Academy.

*What qualifies a student of Cloud Deer Academy to enter the Hanlin Academy?* In the two hundred years since the founding of the Imperial Academy, such a precedent was unheard of.

The ministers inside the hall, as well as the officials outside, dispersed with complex emotions. Crossing the wide plaza, they saw a Silver Gong standing by the main gate, leaning on his blade.

He faced the meridian gate, facing the many servants.

Princess Huaiqing and Princess Lin’an stood at a distance, not standing beside Xu Qi’an.

On one side were hundreds of resplendently dressed officials, wielding real power in the capital.

On the other was a lone, uncouth Silver Gong, a Nightwatcher.

One man blocked the path of the most powerful group in the kingdom.

The officials took notice of this lone Silver Gong, recognising him at once—no one among them was unfamiliar with his identity.

*What does he want to do*

*Did this coarse man want to flaunt his triumph, to show off?*

The Ministers of the Six Departments, their deputies, the Supervisors of the Six Offices, the members of the royal family, the nobles… one by one, their gazes fell upon Xu Qi’an, scrutinising him.

*A mere brutish warrior dares to stand in our way?*

One man, one blade, stood at the meridian gate, halting the many servants.

Xu Qi’an met the gaze of the assembled officials, his eyes sweeping over all of them. Then, he let out a derisive laugh, drew a deep breath, and intoned with a voice as resonant as thunder:

“Though your bodies and names may perish, the rivers and mountains will endure for eternity… *pah!*”

He spat heavily on the ground, lifted his blade, and walked away at a steady pace.

Scorn for them all!
