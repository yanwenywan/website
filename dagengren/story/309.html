# 309. Surprise! The Owner of the Tomb Appears

The moment the sarcophagus opened, an eerie, malevolent energy filled the chamber, and the temperature plummeted. The fire on their torches trembled violently.

Those who had just started to turn away froze in place—not by choice, but because their blood seemed to have solidified. Cloaked in a chilling air, they felt as if they were trapped in an icy realm, their bodies and blood locked in frost.

Had Daoist Jinlian been in cat form, his fur would certainly be standing on end.

Clang!

A deafening crash rang out as the coffin lid hit the ground. At that same moment, those who had their backs turned to the platform saw the helmeted corpse-guards on the steps below. Each one twisted their neck 180 degrees, their faces now staring silently at the group.

The sight was nothing short of terrifying, igniting overwhelming fear in the hearts of the tomb-raiding members of the Houtu Gang.

Crack... crack…

Xu Qi’an could hear the popping sound of bones, not far from him, as the armored figures standing at the four corners of the platform also began to stir.

He cautiously glanced at his companions to gauge their reactions.

Chu Yuanzhen’s eyes were slightly widened, sweat beading on his forehead. The longsword on his back shivered now and then, as if eager to be drawn, but it was held back by an invisible force.

Master Hengyuan’s facial muscles twitched, his jaw clenched as he struggled to break free from the force suppressing him, to no avail.

Daoist Jinlian’s chest rose and fell, as if in a controlled breathing technique. He was calmest of all, though his eyes betrayed a hint of finality.

*Is he preparing a last resort, ready to sacrifice himself to save us...?* Xu Qi’an wondered, glancing at Zhong Li.

Lina remained unconscious on her back, making Zhong Li the most “relaxed” person here. Unfortunately, poor Zhong Li was visibly shaking beneath her hemp robes.

*Is this her fault, or mine...? Probably both!* Xu Qi’an mused grimly.

Then, a scene came unbidden to his mind: a withered hand, covered in green fur, emerging from the sarcophagus, pressing down on its edge.

A figure slowly rose within—a corpse dressed in a yellow robe, crowned in pure gold. The face, with skin stretched tight over the bone, had a nose that had long rotted away, leaving two dark holes.

The eyes were sunken, as though they might fall out at any moment.

The moment his senses captured the corpse’s presence, Xu Qi’an’s head felt as if a steel nail had driven through it. He nearly blacked out from the pain, the image shattering in his mind.

*So, it is indeed that Daoist inside... a failed second rank, no wonder he’s so powerful...* Xu Qi’an’s scalp tingled.

Silence hung in the air for several seconds before the first sound of footsteps echoed—the corpse had left the coffin and was slowly advancing toward them.

“Buzz… buzz…”

Chu Yuanzhen’s longsword trembled violently on his back but still refused to leave its sheath.

Drip drip… Finally, beads of sweat rolled down Chu Yuanzhen’s forehead.

Hengyuan’s eyes bulged, veins pulsing on his temples and neck as he strained, his entire body convulsing in a futile attempt to break free from the suppression.

Zhong Li quivered like a frightened quail, her head drooping lower and lower.

A pungent odor filled the air, as several tomb raiders from the Houtu Gang lost control of their bowels in terror.

But who could blame them? Trapped in an ancient tomb thousands of years old, with something unholy emerging from the coffin and moving slowly toward them…

Just thinking about it sent a chill down the spine—let alone experiencing it firsthand.

Daoist Jinlian closed his eyes briefly, and when he opened them, they held a calm clarity. It seemed he had made up his mind.

But just then, the footsteps ceased, and a hoarse, guttural voice filled every corner of the tomb.

“Welcome back, my lord!”

The clinking of armor sounded in unison as the corpse-guards in the four corners of the platform and on the steps all knelt, worshipping someone in the crowd.

The sinister, horrifying energy rapidly receded, like a tide pulling back.

Everyone was astonished to find they could move again.

“Don’t act rashly!”

Daoist Jinlian transmitted his voice to the others, including the grave robbers.

Gulps and swallowing noises echoed as the tomb raiders, their legs trembling, held onto their senses. Experience had taught them to avoid panicked flight, which would only worsen things.

Yet, one thought struck them all: “My lord”?

Who is this “lord”? Judging by that corpse’s stance, it seemed their “lord” was here among them.

The tomb raiders exchanged wary glances, each one scrutinizing their companions in an effort to identify the “lord” the corpses were revering.

The Sickly Leader instinctively looked to Daoist Jinlian. Based on the wall carvings, the tomb’s master was a Daoist, and they just so happened to have a high-ranking Earth Sect master with them.

It was an easy conclusion to draw: this elderly Daoist must be the corpses’ “lord.”

*So that’s his status… No wonder this Earth Sect master entered the tomb; he wasn’t solely here to rescue us. A true expert’s motives are beyond the understanding of simple folk like myself.*

The sickly Boss trembled.

Arcanist Gongyang Su examined Daoist Jinlian with suspicion.

Sensing the altered attitude of their leaders, the Houtu Gang members immediately focused on the most mysterious figure in the group: Daoist Jinlian. And, curiously, they found themselves feeling more at ease.

The members of the Heaven and Earth Society stood close together, so for a moment, it was unclear whom the yellow-robed corpse was bowing to.

By force of habit, Chu Yuanzhen looked first at Daoist Jinlian.

Daoist Jinlian shook his head slightly.

*Hengyuan was a martial monk, not of the Daoist sect, and despite his great talent, there was nothing particularly strange about him... Lina, a shaman of the Southern Marches, held no ties to this tomb… Miss Zhong of the Sitianjian can also be dismissed... but that means…?!*

Chu Yuanzhen abruptly turned and stared fixedly at Xu Qi’an.

He recalled the reason why the group had entered the main tomb—it was due to three successive "coincidences" orchestrated by Xu Qi'an that they had arrived here.

*So it was not chance after all, but fate... Was Xu Ningyan truly the lord of the owner of this tomb?*

This possibility surfaced in Chu Yuanzhen's mind, filling him with a dreadful awe. His body began to tremble involuntarily.

*Is he kneeling to me? Calling me “my lord”?* As the person in question, Xu Qi'an could sense that the corpse’s “my lord” was directed at him.

He was momentarily overwhelmed with shock and confusion, unsure how to react.

For a second, he nearly blurted out, _Why are you calling me your lord?_

But rationality silenced him, since only two scenarios seemed possible here: First, that he truly was the yellow-robed corpse’s lord, which would make his identity unimaginably terrifying.

Or second, that the corpse had mistakenly identified him.

Ignoring the first scenario for now, if it was the second, if the corpse had mistaken him for someone else, blurting out a question would surely expose him.

Then they’d all be annihilated.

Holding back his rising emotions, Xu Qi'an gazed expressionlessly at the yellow-robed corpse and said in a steady voice:

“Well done.”

The corpse lowered its head even further.

Witnessing this, the sickly Boss was stunned, his eyes widening. *So... so the "lord" the corpse had referred to wasn’t the Daoist, but this sixth-rank warrior?*

*This... this... but he's merely a warrior!*

Likewise, Arcanist Gongyang Su couldn’t mask his shock, immensely relieved that he hadn’t impulsively activated his Qi-watching technique on these “allies.”

Had he done so, he’d likely have died on the spot, slain for seeing what should not be seen.

The Houtu Gang members held their breaths, dumbstruck as they watched Xu Qi'an.

The corpse lowered its head further, its hoarse voice tinged with puzzlement: “Why has my lord not ascended to immortality?”

*Immortality?!*

These words were like a thunderbolt in everyone’s ears, from the weakest grave robbers to the seasoned Daoist Jinlian and, of course, Xu Qi'an himself. Waves of astonishment surged in their hearts.

Compared to the grave robbers who’d lost all control of their expressions, Xu Qi'an and his comrades were steadier, maintaining their composure.

Xu Qi'an, staring expressionless at the corpse, felt a tempest of thoughts swirling within.

_Immortality? From my understanding, ‘immortality’ refers to transcending the ranks, right? An existence on par with Buddha, the Gu God, and the Warlock God._

_Who was this yellow-robed corpse's lord, really?_

_After the age of gods and demons, only a handful of beings have attained beyond-rank. This tomb is over two thousand years old, yet could someone have achieved immortality within this time?_

_Or, maybe they failed to transcend, and this corpse simply doesn’t know…_

_Fuck, who could’ve guessed that our next tomb would be this level of nightmare... It must be Zhong Li’s fault — definitely her fault… What should I do? How am I supposed to respond?_

The corpse’s eyes, sunken deep in its eye sockets, shifted, as though scrutinizing Xu Qi'an.

Aware of the corpse’s scrutiny, Xu Qi'an’s gaze grew sharp, and he spoke slowly, “Are you teaching me how to do things?”

The corpse flinched, lowering its head with trembling humility. “Forgive me, my lord… Forgive me, my lord…”

With that, the corpse undid its yellow robe, revealing its withered body beneath. Its chest was sunken, the ribs protruding visibly beneath taut skin.

Additionally, Xu Qi'an noticed scorch marks on the corpse’s body.

“Thud…”

Then, unexpectedly, the corpse performed an act no one could have anticipated—it raised a hand and pierced its own chest, extracting a piece of translucent jade, not a heart, but an intricately carved jade seal.

“Did my lord return to reclaim this seal? You left it with me, instructing me to nourish it well. I… I have safeguarded it all this time, and now, I present it to you, my lord.”

The corpse offered up the jade seal with reverence and asked in a hoarse, reverent tone, “And now… and now, what year is it?”

“The current dynasty is called Feng,” Xu Qi'an replied coolly.

“Feng…” the corpse murmured, bowing again. “And how many years have I slept?”

_How should I know? Why don’t you come with me, and I’ll hand you over to the authorities to get an answer…_ Xu Qi'an mentally grumbled.

After a moment of thought, he chose not to answer the corpse directly and instead said coolly, “Time holds no meaning for those like us, does it?”

*Brilliant response!*

Daoist Jinlian silently commended him, impressed by Xu Ningyan’s composure.

He subtly signaled Xu Qi'an, indicating it was time to find an exit.

Xu Qi'an caught on, extended his hand to receive the jade seal, and said, “Return to your slumber.”

There was no need for further words. First, because speaking too much could raise suspicions, and second, he was role-playing, and as the lord, retrieving his property required no explanation.

He didn’t actually want the jade seal, but from the corpse’s reaction, it seemed vitally important. Refusing it might arouse suspicion.

The jade felt firm and warm, like polished stone. As he turned it discreetly, he glimpsed the words inscribed on its base. But before he could make them out fully, the jade crumbled into fine white dust, slipping through his fingers.

Then, a surge of indescribable power, like a tidal wave, traveled up his arm and coursed into his body.

He felt his blood rush to his head, inducing a powerful dizziness. It was as if something within him was awakening.

“You are not my lord…”

The corpse jerked its head up, its eyes burning with a rising blood-red glow.

A hoarse, seething voice echoed through the tomb chamber, brimming with killing intent.

“Run!”

Daoist Jinlian was the first to react, sweeping his sleeve to conjure a powerful gust, hurtling the Houtu Gang’s grave robbers and Chu Yuanzhen off the high platform and toward the main tomb’s exit.

At the same time, he grabbed Xu Qi'an by the shoulder, attempting to throw him down to safety.

He would remain behind, and face the wrath of the risen corpse.

But Xu Qi'an shrugged off his hand, pressed his palm against Jinlian’s chest, and muttered, “Daoist, get them out of here.

“I’ll stay.”

Boom!

A blast of force surged from his palm, propelling Daoist Jinlian back.

As he flew, Daoist Jinlian saw the corpse seize Xu Qi'an by the neck, lifting him high in the air. The armored guardians on each corner of the platform charged forward, weapons raised, prepared to shred the impostor to pieces.

“Xu Qi’an…” murmured Daoist Jinlian.
