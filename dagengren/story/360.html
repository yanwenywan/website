# 360. Xu Qi'an's Ambush Plan

*A month ago... Sanhuang County lies on the outskirts of Chuzhou. Such strict inspections—are they searching for someone or trying to block someone?*

*I’ve been spending my days trekking through the deep mountains and forests, barely paying attention to whether there are checkpoints on the official roads.*

*Whoever they’re searching for, it’s certainly not me... Or am I overthinking? Though there’s a possibility they’ve added me to their “blacklist” recently.*

*In any case, searching for one person or two doesn’t change much for me.*

Xu Qi’an drummed his fingers on the table as he analysed the situation and outlined his short-term objectives:

*Tomorrow, I’ll head to Xikou Commandery. If there’s indeed an issue there, it might very well be the site of the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles case. If that’s true, there could be danger. Should I bring the princess consort along?*

*Hmm, I can leave her at a safe inn near Xikou Commandery when I get close. The princess consort is a valuable chess piece—if used wisely, she might save my life. I can’t leave her behind.*

Seeing Xu Qi’an deep in thought, Cai’er remained obediently silent, sitting quietly at the side.

Time passed, and Xu Qi’an finally snapped out of his thoughts, giving a command: “Brew me a pot of tea.”

Cai’er’s eyes lit up, and she cheerfully responded. This meant Silver Gong Xu planned to stay the night here.

As she brewed tea, Xu Qi’an gave another instruction: “Change the sheets and bedding.”

Cai’er felt a thrill run through her, her hands trembling slightly with excitement as she quickly changed the sheets and bedding.

After drinking the pot of tea, it was late into the night. Under Cai’er’s service, Xu Qi’an soaked his feet before lying down on the bed, stretching lazily.

Having spent several nights sleeping rough in the wilderness with terrible rest, he relished the comfort of a soft bed.

“Sir Xu, shall I serve you tonight?” Cai’er asked, sitting on the edge of the bed, a radiant smile on her face as she began to disrobe.

“Cai’er,” Xu Qi’an said, looking at her from his reclined position. “Don’t you think your bed is too soft? It might not be comfortable to sleep on.”

“You’re absolutely right, Sir Xu. They say sleeping on a hard bed is better for the body. A soft bed can tire a person,” Cai’er replied with a smile, thinking, _Discussing bed comfort now? Sir Xu truly is a charming man._

Xu Qi’an nodded with a serious expression. “So, for the sake of your health, you’ll sleep on the floor tonight, and I’ll take the bed.”

Cai’er: “???”

...

At dawn the next day, Xu Qi’an finished his morning routine. Ignoring Cai’er’s resentful glances, he left Yayin Building.

By now, it was late spring. The weather was warm, even hot by midday. If not for this, one might have seen the amusing sight of patrons shivering in the cold morning breeze.

Xu Qi’an strolled leisurely down the street, heading toward the inn.

Suddenly, a column of armoured soldiers appeared ahead. Leading them wasn’t an armored general but a man cloaked in black, wearing a mask.

Xu Qi’an’s gaze lingered on the man in the black cloak for a few seconds before he shifted his eyes and brushed past the group.

“Wait right there!”

The voice of the black-cloaked man came from behind, followed by the sound of reins being pulled.

_So sharp?_ Xu Qi’an turned, naturally adopting a cautious yet respectful demeanor, bowing slightly. “Sir, were you calling for me?”

The man turned his horse around, towering over Xu Qi’an as he scrutinized him. “Where are you from? Do you have a travel permit?”

“I do.”

Xu Qi’an provided his fabricated identity.

“Have you trained in martial arts?” the man asked again.

With a humble yet slightly proud tone, Xu Qi’an replied, “This humble one was born with a talent for martial arts and reached the peak of Refining Vitality at nineteen. However, breaking into the Refining Qi realm has been challenging. Coupled with the distractions of women and the responsibilities of marriageable age, I…”

His tone conveyed both pride and regret in just the right measure.

The black-cloaked man studied his face for a moment before saying nothing. He turned his horse and continued leading the troops forward.

*Phew…*

Watching the soldiers vanish into the distance, Xu Qi’an heaved a sigh of relief, retracting his One Blade from Heaven and Earth stance. The technique allowed his aura to collapse inward and remain concealed.

_Heh, as the saying goes, there are no useless skills, only useless people. I’ve perfectly addressed the martial artist’s weakness of being unable to hide their presence. The downside is that holding back and not releasing the energy feels... really uncomfortable…_

It was a discomfort that all men could relate to.

_That guy’s attire is strange. He must be one of the Zhenbei King’s spies mentioned in the reports. The Zhenbei King’s spies appearing in Sanhuang County... heh…_

_They’re definitely looking for someone. It could be me or someone else._

In truth the Nightwatchers were also spies; Emperor Yuanjing’s spies. Thus they had a departmental structure, and ate off a government salary. As for the spies of the Zhenbei King, they were his own “private mercenaries.”

Outside the north, they had nothing. But here, even the court’s delegations must treat them with some respect.

Because they represented the Zhenbei King alone. 

*As a confidant of the Zhenbei King, he must know a lot. Why should I continue feeling around, alone and blindfolded? This case is different from both the Yunzhou and Sangpo cases; no need to painstakingly unwind the thread, there’s a clear target in sight: reveal the truth of “blood runs three thousand miles”.*

*And such a heavy massacre cannot be hidden. This means that I don’t need to take the approach of previous cases and slowly look for clues. As long as I can kidnap him, a light bit of torture would get some answers. If he’s an evil person, I’ll just kill him and ask his soul…*

Xu Qi’an returned to the inn. Early risers were already having breakfast in the hall, while those unwilling to leave their rooms had food delivered by the inn’s staff.

This naturally excluded the timid princess consort. Until Xu Qi’an returned, she wouldn’t let any man into her room, nor would she leave.

After ordering breakfast to be delivered upstairs, Xu Qi’an climbed to the princess consort’s room. With a slight movement of his ear, he detected soft breathing from within.

_Still asleep…_ Pressing his palm against the door, he used his Qi to unlock it.

Inside, the princess consort lay on her side, her posture elegant, her expression peaceful. At this moment, she finally looked like a true royal consort.

Xu Qi’an opened the window to let fresh air in, then sat at the vanity table, replaying the case in his mind.

***Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles Case***

*Location: Xikou Commandery (suspected).*     
*Perpetrator: Unknown.*     
*Motive: Unknown.*

***Ambush on the Princess Consort Case***

*Location: En route north.*     
*Perpetrators: Northern barbarians and yaoguai.*     
*Motive: To prevent the Zhenbei King from advancing to the second rank and to covet the princess consort’s body (spiritual essence).*

*Currently, these two cases currently lack substantial connections. Perhaps the barbarians learned of the Zhenbei King’s impending promotion and sought to distract him by raiding the border. Meanwhile, they secretly ambushed and tried to seize the princess consort.*

*The Zhenbei King is Chuzhou’s military commander, with a great deal of power. Without an imperial summons, he cannot return to the capital. But Emperor Yuanjing seems supportive of his brother’s promotion to the second rank, so summoning him shouldn’t be difficult. Thus the signs of the barbarians invading the north makes sense.*

*But the Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles case happened around the same time? Yet, the four fourth-rank experts and tribal leaders know nothing about it. More intriguingly, Deputy General Chu Xianglong is also in the dark.*

*It might have been perpetrated by a strong barbarian who kept it under wraps. But why did a mysterious Arcanist get involved? What are they planning?*

As Xu Qi’an pondered, he noticed in the mirror that the princess consort had woken, rubbing her eyes and sitting up.

“You’re awake?” Xu Qi’an chuckled.

The princess consort yawned, ignoring him as she fetched the toiletries and crouched by the bed to wash her face and brush her teeth.

After tidying up, she wrinkled her nose in disdain and said, “You reek of powder and perfume. Some people, I tell you, are bound to die on a woman’s belly someday.”

*Right now, you look just like a resentful wife who can’t control her philandering husband...* Xu Qi’an mocked inwardly, though he kept this observation to himself. 

Of course, the princess consort couldn’t care less whether he visited brothels or not; what bothered her was that he had abandoned her last night to carouse while she had to stay alone at the inn, anxious and afraid.

“Why not rest a bit longer?” Xu Qi’an suggested. “We’ll set off in an hour, heading west to Xikou Commandery.”

“You’re not handling your business anymore?” The princess consort was taken aback.

“Already done. Settled everything at the brothel,” Xu Qi’an replied with a mischievous grin.

The Nightwatchers’ network was a secret, not something he could disclose, even to the harmless princess consort. To reveal it would be disrespectful to his informants. Still, since the princess consort was indeed harmless, he wasn’t too concerned about her piecing anything together with her limited scheming abilities.

“Hmph...” The princess consort flushed and spat lightly.

…

The Capital, the Jiaofangsi.

Fuxiang lazily got out of bed, washed up, and dressed with the help of her maid. As she sat in front of the mirror brushing her hair, she suddenly pressed a hand to her chest and frowned.

A moment later, her expression returned to normal. She said softly, “Leave me be; I need to sleep a while longer.”

Though puzzled, the maid complied without comment and quietly exited the room.

Once alone, Fuxiang pulled a fox-head incense burner and a black incense stick from under the bed. She clipped a strand of her hair, wrapped it around the incense, and lit it. Placing the incense in the burner, she set it reverently on the table, knelt, and began murmuring incantations.

The black incense burned rapidly, its ashes falling lightly onto the table and forming a short message:

*Matters in the North are resolved. You are permitted to return to your clan.*

Seeing this, Fuxiang’s face lit with a mix of excitement and joy, as if her long-suffering days were finally over. Yet, in her eyes lay a trace of reluctance and wistful longing.

…

Chuzhou City.

After three days of travel, the delegation, escorted by five hundred soldiers dispatched by the Zhenbei King, arrived in Chuzhou City.

Among the thirteen provinces of Great Feng, most provincial seats were located centrally. Only Chuzhou City was different, situated near the border, facing the northern barbarians and demon clans.

The people of the northern frontier often said that it was only because the Zhenbei King held Chuzhou City that it had withstood decades of barbarian incursions.

Historically, Chuzhou had fallen twice, with both instances resulting in bloody massacres.

However, under the Zhenbei King’s reign, the area surrounding Chuzhou had enjoyed peace and prosperity. The barbarian cavalry dared not approach within a hundred miles of the city, as it was home to the northern frontier’s most elite troops.

The Deputy Justice of the High Court lifted the curtain of his carriage, gazing at the towering city walls engraved with intricate, arcane patterns that covered every corner.

Mounted along the walls were cannons, ballistae, and other devastating weapons developed by Sitianjian.

“According to the _Geographical Records of Great Feng – Records of Chuzhou_, the city walls are fortified with magical formations, making them sturdy enough to withstand attacks from even a third-rank expert. Truly a marvel in person,” the Deputy Justice remarked.

The border cities of Great Feng were all inscribed with similar formations to bolster their defences, maintained and enhanced by the arcanists of Sitianjian every hundred years.

“And with the Zhenbei King here, Chuzhou is as secure as a fortress,” Censor Liu concurred.

As the delegation reached the city gates, they saw a group of officials already waiting to greet them. Leading them was a man in a crimson robe, his long beard reaching his chest. His thin, scholarly face bore an air of elegance with the sharpness of an official serving at the borders.

This was Zheng Xinghuai, the Provincial Governor of Chuzhou.

“Governor Zheng, it’s been three years since we parted in the capital,” Censor Liu said with a hearty laugh, clearly well-acquainted with Zheng Xinghuai.

The governor nodded slightly, his reserved demeanor softening into a polite smile. After an exchange of pleasantries, he led the delegation to Chuzhou’s largest relay station.

After settling in, Yang Yan and the others joined Governor Zheng in the main hall for a discussion.

“Governor Zheng, His Majesty and the court were shocked and enraged to hear of the ‘Blood Runs Three Thousand Miles’ case. We have been sent to investigate this matter and hope for your full cooperation,” Censor Liu said with a bow.

Zheng Xinghuai, already briefed on the matter, nodded slightly and asked, “How can this official assist you, esteemed sirs?”

Yang Yan got straight to the point. “We require access to the northern army’s deployment records and the correspondence between various local constabularies in Chuzhou.”

The governor did not respond immediately. Instead, he glanced around the group and casually remarked, “I heard that Chief Investigator Silver Gong Xu has returned to the capital due to injuries?”

Censor Liu sighed. “We were ambushed en route...”

Zheng Xinghuai furrowed his brow and, with a tone of formal detachment, said, “Without the Chief Investigator, the authority to act at discretion... Nonetheless, this official can grant access to the constabularies’ correspondence, but as for the army’s deployment records, I fear only the Chief Investigator has the jurisdiction. I will report to King Huai, though I cannot guarantee his consent.”

The group showed no displeasure, instead thanking the governor warmly.

After the meeting, Zheng Xinghuai excused himself, citing official duties.

The Deputy Justice of the High Court glanced at Censor Liu and shook his head. “What a pity. You’re still a censor, not an inspector general. If only...”

Censors in the capital were still Censors. However, once they received a royal command to investigate afar, then they were now Inspector Generals.

The authority of an Inspector General is such that it immediately outranked the three highest provincial roles of military commander, governor, and judicial commisioner.

However, it was precisely because of this authority that Emperor Yuanjing had appointed Xu Qi’an as the lead official, ensuring the delegation couldn’t overpower King Huai.

Yang Yan asked coolly, “How is this Governor Zheng as an official?”

Censor Liu quickly replied, “I have some acquaintance with him. He’s an honest and upright man, known for his integrity.”

…

Sanhuang County.

Outside the city, beneath a roadside canopy, the plain-featured princess consort and the handsome Xu Qi’an sat at a table, sipping cheap tea.

The stall, located near the city gate, charged only two copper coins per pot of tea. Its location beneath a large banyan tree ensured a cool and comfortable atmosphere. Travelers frequently stopped here to rest and refresh.

Xu Qi’an held his teacup, contemplating his “ambush” plan.

To extract information from the Zhenbei King’s spies, he couldn’t act within the city—doing so would endanger innocent civilians and risk counterattacks.

The best strategy was to wait until they left the city.

Spies on a manhunt wouldn’t linger in one small county for long. With countless towns and villages in the northern frontier, they couldn’t possibly have agents stationed everywhere.

Thus, they were likely transient.

All he had to do was lie in wait.

Just then, he noticed that the men at the next table were behaving rather oddly.
