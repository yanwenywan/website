# 405. Trump Card

“Quick, quick, they’re just a head!”

Several groups of armed men, torches in hand, darted through the dense forest, weapons at the ready, dashing like the wind.

Among them were King Huai’s secret agents, demon Daoists from the Earth Sect, and Jianghu wanderers eager for rewards in the form of magical artefacts amidst the chaos. Naturally, there were also people from the Wulin Alliance like Young Master Liu and Rongrong.

Additionally, some seemingly there for the excitement were actually planning to support Silver Gong Xu out of a sense of justice.

Li Miaozhen and the others were holding back the fourth rank experts, but they couldn’t entirely stop the associated subordinates and disciples.

When the battle erupted in the small town, all parties instinctively left the town to search for Xu Qi’an and the mysterious young master.

“Keep up, if we’re too late, Xu Qi’an will be personally slain by that man. Do you still want the magical artefact or not?”

“Would killing Silver Gong Xu offend some major taboo?”

“What are you afraid of? I’ve already changed my appearance. You can’t get rich without taking risks — if you want to make a name for yourself, sometimes you have to walk the blade’s edge.”

“Exactly. The only issue now is that Silver Gong Xu might already be dead. Tsk, those two experts beside that young master are truly formidable.”

…

“Tower Master, the Sect Master of the Shenquan Sect and the Pavilion Master of Ink Pavilion have all stepped forward. You’ll also lend Silver Gong Xu a hand later, won’t you?”

Rongrong was doing her utmost to keep up with her Tower Master, trying not to lag behind. Even though the Tower Master was deliberately slowing down, Rongrong still found it strenuous.

Xiao Yuenu’s graceful figure leapt effortlessly through the forest, her cool voice replying, “The Nine-coloured Lotus is something our Wulin Alliance desires. Treasures of heaven and earth belong to the capable. But if fate grants it to us, it’s fortune; if fate denies it, it’s destiny. As for Silver Gong Xu…”

*Hm?* Rongrong glanced at her Tower Master.

Xiao Yuenu’s smile was dazzling. “There’s only one Silver Gong Xu. How many years has it been since Great Feng produced someone like Xu Qi’an? Losing him here would be far too dull.”

“So, hurry along. If we’re too late, Silver Gong Xu will be in real danger.”

On one side stood a mysterious young man with two peak fourth rank experts as his retainers and no shortage of magical artefacts — his foundation incredibly deep. On the other side stood Xu Qi’an, whose companions had all stayed behind in the town to hold off enemies, leaving him at best with only one ally.

The outcome’s balance, where it would tip, was obvious.

Rongrong burst into smiles and nodded vigorously.

Following the flow of qi and the deafening explosions, along with the sound of heavy crossbow bolts being fired, the various groups soon arrived at the battlefield.

Rongrong suddenly noticed that Tower Master Xiao had stopped. This stunning beauty’s delicate frame visibly stiffened, frozen on the spot, as if she’d seen something inconceivable.

What was more astonishing was that several elders of Wanhua Tower, including Rongrong’s own master, reacted in exactly the same way.

Rongrong’s gaze swept past them to the scene ahead.

In that moment, she understood why.

Beneath the deep night sky, a young man clad in black form-fitting clothing, his long ponytail tied high, stood there holding a slightly curved narrow-bladed sabre in one hand — and in the other, a freshly severed, blood-dripping head.

That was the same arrogant, extravagant young man from earlier in the day.

*He was dead!?*

Rongrong’s pupils contracted, her rosy lips slightly parted. This wasn’t how she imagined things would unfold — nor how the Tower Master, or most others, had envisioned it.

One by one, figures emerged from the forest into the clearing, reaching the hillside, only to discover that the battle had long been over.

The mysterious, ostentatious young man with an undeniably deep background — his head was now in Silver Gong Xu’s hand, delivering a profound shock to all present.

Xu Qi’an saw the approaching crowd, roughly a hundred people from various factions.

He raised the severed head towards them, his gaze sharp as a blade. “Who else wants to kill me?”

The gathered crowd fell into silence. No one dared respond.

Including the Earth Sect Daoists and King Huai’s agents.

Though they harboured intense murderous intent towards Xu Qi’an, none dared to step forward and seek death.

Xu Qi’an sneered, no longer bothering with them, narrowing his eyes to assess the ongoing battles around him.

…

“He… he actually died at Silver Gong Xu’s hands…”

“And I thought he was so formidable — issuing such a bold bounty. I was even prepared to risk breaking taboos to kill Silver Gong Xu.”

“Pah, useless thing.”

The rogue Jianghu wanderers who had been ready to take desperate measures now wore complicated expressions.

On the other hand, those Jianghu wanderers and Wulin Alliance members who had been worried for Xu Qi’an felt a collective wave of relief, followed by a chorus of exclamations.

“Well done! We underestimated Silver Gong Xu. If he dared to come here directly, he must have had something to rely on.” A burly man laughed loudly.

“We thought all his companions had stayed back in the town… Silver Gong Xu, what a man. We were worried for nothing. Hmm, who’s that white-clad arcanist? And who’s that beauty? They’re actually holding their own against a Rank Four martial artist.”

“Don’t celebrate too soon. Those two are Rank Four peak experts. As long as they can keep stalling, once our Earth Sect elder arrives, it’s anyone’s guess who’ll live or die.” A young Earth Sect disciple spoke darkly.

His gaze was sinister, brimming with malice.

A black-robed secret agent spoke slowly, “Actually, it’s better that he’s dead. It changes nothing. If anything, it’ll only make those two experts even more determined to seek revenge at all costs.”

Xu Qi’an coldly observed the battlefield, thoughts racing.

*It’s been fifteen minutes — in another quarter-hour, the backlash from my “One Blade from Heaven and Earth” will be returned doubled by the Confucian magic. Amd back in the town, only Li Miaozhen and Chu Yuanzhen have fourth rank strength. Lina and Master Hengyuan aren’t quite there. They won’t be able to hold out much longer — this needs to end quickly…*

*But killing two peak Rank Four martial artists is far too difficult. Even fighting until dawn might not yield a clear victor.*

Xu Qi’an’s eyes glinted as an idea struck him. He raised Qiu Qian’s severed head high and mockingly shouted:

“A master dishonoured means loyal retainers die in shame! You two — your master’s head has been taken by me. How do you still have the face to live in this world? Why haven’t you slit your own throats to atone? Or perhaps… you want revenge? Then come on! Come kill me if you’ve got the nerve.”

The best way to provoke someone is to stomp on their sorest wound and mock them mercilessly.

To enhance the effect and stoke even deeper hatred, he deliberately put on a smug, despicable expression.

Sure enough, the two hulking men erupted with fury. They knew full well how difficult it would be to defeat a Gold Gong and a fourth rank arcanist — compared to that, killing Xu Qi’an himself would be much easier.

And it would avenge their young master.

At present, one disregarded the bombardment of artillery, and one disregarded Gold Gong Nangong Qianrou’s frenzied counterattack, even exchanging injury for a chance to break free. One from the left and one from the right, they tacitly pincered Xu Qi’an.

*So this is being “flanked by two men”...* Xu Qi’an’s expression was solemn yet calm. When the two high-rank martial artists charged at him from front and back with speed imperceptible to the naked eye, he softly recited:

“I am behind the Left Guardian, they are imprisoned…”

He swiftly blew two plausible boasts, and his figure vanished. The bodies of the two burly men froze momentarily, but only momentarily — the imprisoning effect did not fully take hold.

However, for Xu Qi’an, this fleeting instant was the crucial window of opportunity he had to seize.

In the brief pause where the Left and Right Guardians’ bodies stiffened, Xu Qi’an appeared behind the Left Guardian and flung out a yellow sword talisman.

Between heaven and earth, a flash of light flickered and vanished.

The bodies of the Left and Right Guardian abruptly split apart — their lower halves still charging forward while their upper halves toppled, viscera spilling across the ground.

Their lower halves collided into each other and collapsed in unison, their feet kicking weakly in the air.

A few seconds later, a thunderous crash echoed from the distant mountains — the terrifying power of a single sword strike from the Human Sect Daoist Leader.

“You, you…”

Even cut in half at the waist, the Left Guardian was not yet dead. His eyes bulged wide, staring at Xu Qi’an with seething hatred.

Xu Qi’an sensibly stepped back, giving no chance for the two to counterattack.

A Rank Four martial artist’s vitality was extraordinarily tenacious — as long as they were not dead, there was always the possibility of a desperate counter-kill. Xu Qi’an would not make the rookie mistake of becoming complacent.

*I have the Jianzheng as my backer, a bigshot residing within my body, and even the benevolent aunt’s gifted talisman sword in hand. In terms of backing, who have I ever feared…* Xu Qi’an glanced mockingly at the Left Guardian and, right before his eyes, slammed Qiu Qian’s head into pulp with a single palm.

*This foolish thing — even if you were the Crown Prince of the Great Feng, you would still be nothing in front of me.*

The Left Guardian’s eyes almost burst with rage.

Nangong Qianrou appeared before the Left Guardian and kicked his head apart, extinguishing his last breath. Then, with a swift spin and a high kick, he stomped down ferociously, shattering the Right Guardian’s skull as well.

Phew, not bad at all for head-snatching… Xu Qi’an felt fully at ease and gave him a smile.

Nangong Qianrou did not return a pleasant expression, only replying with a leer.

If Yang Qianhuan’s involvement was a flash of inspiration, then Nangong Qianrou was one of Xu Qi’an’s trump cards — the central figure of his entire plan tonight.

The three-versus-two situation would inevitably make Qiu Qian confidently believe victory was assured.

Qiu Qian’s proposal of single combat was the best evidence of that.

Of course, if Qiu Qian had not chosen single combat, Xu Qi’an would have had Nangong Qianrou ambush the Right Guardian, while he and Yang Qianhuan coordinated — the three of them joining forces to first kill the Right Guardian.

With a trump card in hand, tactics could be flexible and adaptable.

“Quite a few artefacts here.”

Nangong Qianrou removed the leather pouches hanging at the Left and Right Guardian’ waists, opened them, glanced inside, and her beautiful eyes sparkled.

“One share each — don’t be greedy, give Yang Qianhuan his share too.”

Xu Qi’an also bent down, picking up Qiu Qian’s leather pouch and that Moonshadow Sword.

After the three had divided the spoils, Yang Qianhuan collected all the cannons and bed crossbows at the scene. Placing his hands on their shoulders, he gently stamped his foot.

The trio vanished from everyone’s sight.

A long while later, several powerful presences arrived — Tianji, Tianshu, and the six Daoists Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Azure, and Blue.

Upon seeing the dismembered and beheaded corpses, they knew the outcome was irreversible.

Tianji, suppressing his fury, demanded, “Why did the Earth Sect Daoist Leader not intervene?”

The eldest, Daoist Honglian, replied in a low voice, “Have you forgotten the mysterious expert who appeared in Chuzhou? If the Daoist Leader intervened, what if that mysterious expert intervened as well? The Daoist Leader’s avatar must be preserved for the lotus seed.”

Tianji’s expression froze.

The female spy, Tianshu, angrily asked, “What were you three doing then?”

Hearing this, Daoist Honglian became even more irate, gnashing his teeth. “The Pavilion Master of the Ink Pavilion and the Leader of the Shenquan Sect blocked us. Those vulgar martial artists are thick-skinned and extremely difficult to deal with.”

Tianshu fell silent, swept a glance at the people at the forest’s edge, and sighed. “After tonight, these wandering Jianghu folk will no longer dare to oppose Xu Qi’an.

“Many factions within the Wulin Alliance will also become divided as a result, with a significant portion withdrawing. The situation is far from optimistic.”

The lotus Daoists of the Earth Sect felt a heavy weight in their hearts.

…

Yue Clan Manor.

The formations etched into the ground lit up one by one, clear light converging as three figures manifested within the array.

Daoist Jinlian, Daoist Nun Bailian, and thirty-four Heaven and Earth Society disciples silently stood guard around the formation. Seeing them arrive, they immediately gathered around.

Qiu Chanyi rushed to the front, her bright eyes gazing at Xu Qi’an with a soft intensity. “Master Xu, how did it go?”

After asking, she held her breath, her face filled with tension.

The other disciples were equally tense, all eyes on Xu Qi’an, awaiting his answer.

“We killed them!” Xu Qi’an nodded.

Cheers erupted instantly. Smiles blossomed across the disciples’ faces, though their eyes shimmered with tears.

Qiu Chanyi beamed with joy, her eyes filled with admiration.

Daoist Jinlian asked, “Those two Rank Fours…”

Xu Qi’an nodded.

“That’s good then.” Daoist Jinlian smiled.

“It’s not good at all.”

Xu Qi’an pushed through the disciples and instructed, “Prepare healing pills, prepare food, prepare hot water and clean clothes. Daoist, prepare to save me…”

He suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground.

Everyone was shocked — the cheers abruptly ceased as they stared in astonishment, discovering that Silver Gong Xu’s face had turned pale, his eyes cloudy, his skin dry and dull, and his limbs convulsing violently.

His qi plummeted, his heartbeat and breathing verging on cessation.

These were the signs of death by exhaustion.

The backlash of Confucian magic had upgraded the depletion caused by “One Blade from Heaven and Earth” into death by exhaustion.

Qiu Chanyi shrieked, throwing herself beside Xu Qi’an, her face drained of colour in fear.

Daoist Jinlian rushed forward, first checking his breath, then feeling his pulse — discovering that Xu Qi’an’s internal organs were all showing signs of rapid failure.

His vitality was rapidly draining away.

“Fetch the strongest restorative pills, bring my treasured blood ginseng…” Daoist Jinlian issued a rapid string of orders.

Nangong Qianrou bent down, grabbed Xu Qi’an’s other hand, and channelled qi gently into his body to nourish it.

The Heaven and Earth Society disciples sprang into action, their expressions panicked and anxious. The female disciples wiped away tears in fear, terrified that something might happen to Silver Gong Xu.

…

When Xu Qi’an awoke, it was deep in the night.

The night was tranquil, with the faint chirping of insects drifting in from beyond the gauze window. An oil lamp sat on a small wooden table, its flame flickering like a tiny bean, casting an orange glow across the room.

He saw a beauty in white sitting by the table, resting her delicate hand against her cheek, watching him with bored eyes.

“Oh, you’re awake!”

The woman in white spoke.

Her voice was not the sweet crispness of a young girl, but carried a trace of languor and seduction.

Xu Qi’an closed his eyes, opened them again, then closed them once more, repeating the action a few times.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“Maybe I’m opening my eyes the wrong way. How could it be you keeping watch beside me while I was unconscious?”

“No matter how many times you open your eyes, it’ll still be me.”

Susu pouted and said, “Do you not like me being here? Or would you prefer that weepy little girl who insisted on staying to take care of you? Hmm, Qiu Chanyi, right?

“Xu Qi’an, you really are something. Wherever you go, you leave a trail of romantic entanglements. Are you some prized stallion from the countryside brought in for breeding?”

“In fact, the women who’ve had in-depth exchanges with me and built deep, mutual understanding can be counted on one hand.” Xu Qi’an propped himself up on his weary arms, sat up, and said irritably, “What are you just sitting there for? Pour me a cup of water. I’m parched.”

Though her words were sharp, Susu’s actions were obedient, and she immediately poured him a cup of water.

“You can’t blame me for being too charming and always attracting women. That’s classic victim-blaming.”

After easing his parched throat, Xu Qi’an handed the cup back to Susu and asked, “Why are you the one looking after me?”

Susu sat down at the bedside, holding the cup, and rolled her charming eyes. “Master said I’m your concubine, and with my husband injured, of course I should be here, ready to disrobe and care for you at the bedside.

“So, she sent that girl Qiu Chanyi away and left me here to look after you.”

*Sending away a pretty young girl and leaving a paper spirit to care for me…* Xu Qi’an felt Li Miaozhen’s malicious intent, then asked, “How long was I unconscious?”

He clenched his fist, finding his strength lacking — the aftereffects of being drained of energy.

But the fact he could recover his vitality and awaken within a couple hours meant they had used quite a bit of precious medicine.

“Thank Daoist Jinlian for me — he must have spent a fair bit of good stuff.” Xu Qi’an smiled.

Susu tilted her head and pouted. “That poverty-stricken Heaven and Earth Society couldn’t have revived you even if they tried till dawn. It was that nutcase arcanist who saved you.”

“Senior Brother Yang?”

Xu Qi’an was stunned, but then remembered that in terms of healing, even Daoists couldn’t match arcanists. He nodded in understanding.

“But the Heaven and Earth Society did their best, using their best pills and a blood ginseng to save you. Then that nutcase arcanist said, ‘Daoists will always be Daoists, their poverty enough to make one weep.’

“After that, he took out a pill and fed it to you. I heard it’s as precious as the Blood Foetus Pill.” Susu said.

*Arcanists really are filthy rich, just like the Human Sect — both are damn moneybags…* Xu Qi’an pictured the scene and thought Senior Brother Yang must have had a grand time showing off this time.

One step after another, all seamlessly connected.

“Susu, I’m fine now. You can leave for now. Stay outside, and don’t let anyone disturb me.” Xu Qi’an instructed.

“I haven’t even become your concubine yet, and you’re already ordering me around.” Susu grumbled.

“Go on!”

Xu Qi’an gave her paper backside a pat.

Once Susu had shut the door behind her, Xu Qi’an removed the sachet from his waist, undid the knot, and released Qiu Qian’s soul.
