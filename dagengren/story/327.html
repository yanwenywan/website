# 327X. Recollections of the Su Family

Wei Yuan stepped forward, clasped his hands, and declared in a resonant voice, “In times of peace, military households can be self-sufficient from their fields. When war breaks out, the court must allocate provisions and supplies—this is a fundamental principle.”

Prime Minister Wang squinted slightly, his gaze deep as he looked at Wei Yuan.

Chu Xianglong smiled at these words. In matters of war, this group of scholars who could only wag their tongues couldn’t compare to a single word from Wei Yuan. Obtaining supplies and military pay would already fulfill half of his mission for this trip to the capital.

Meanwhile, Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong secretly breathed a sigh of relief, surprised that Wei Yuan would support his strategy. This would allow him to steer clear of the lasting ripples of the exam fraud scandal and remain uninvolved. 

On second thought, this aligned with the emperor’s intentions. The support of meritorious nobles within and “pressure” from the barbarian armies outside made this a trend impossible to resist. Even those ministers opposing the plan understood the situation clearly.

Unexpectedly, Wei Yuan changed his tone and said, “However, before proceeding, your servant has a matter to report to Your Majesty.”

Everyone turned to look at him.

Wei Yuan’s expression remained impassive, paying no heed to the gazes of the officials.

Emperor Yuanjing said, “Speak.”

Wei Yuan began, “My subordinate Bronze gonds discovered a group of martial artists engaged in a deadly fight outside the capital. When they intervened to stop the conflict, the larger group not only ignored the order but decapitated their opponent and fled.”

Wei Yuan’s words were as firm as iron, making the situation seem irrefutable. “Before dying, the victim cried out, ‘The North is in turmoil!’”

At these words, the expressions of all present—including the Emperor Yuanjing—changed.

Chu Xianglong snapped his head toward Wei Yuan but quickly averted his gaze, not daring to offend. He stiffened his neck and said, “The North is, of course, in turmoil. The barbarians are looting and provoking conflict…”

Wei Yuan’s tone remained calm. “So, the barbarians’ massacre letting blood run three thousand miles in the North can be dismissed with mere words of looting and burning, General Chu?”

This statement left everyone stunned. The Emperor Yuanjing rose from his throne, his piercing gaze fixed on Wei Yuan below.

“Wei Yuan, explain yourself! What do you mean by ‘blood runs three thousand miles’?”

Chu Xianglong quickly interjected, “Your Majesty, that is absolutely untrue…”

“Silence!”

The emperor raised his hand to interrupt, giving Chu Xianglong a frosty glance before turning back to Wei Yuan. “What evidence do you have?”

Reaching into his robe, Wei Yuan produced a sachet, untied the red cord, and released a wisp of green smoke. The smoke coiled and formed the faint image of a man with indistinct features and lifeless eyes. The figure murmured, “Blood runs three thousand miles… blood runs three thousand miles… we plead the court… send troops… to suppress…”

Wei Yuan added, “This man’s corpse has been brought here and is currently outside the palace gates. Your Majesty may send someone to examine it. He is a resident of the northern regions.”

The Imperial Study fell into silence.

The Emperor Yuanjing slowly rose, his face as dark as a storm, and said in a measured tone, “Examine the corpse!”

The elderly eunuch bowed his head and hurried out to relay the command, almost as if fleeing, not daring to make a sound.

Seated on his throne, the emperor maintained his stern expression without uttering a word. Below, the officials exchanged silent glances. Chu Xianglong’s face turned ashen, and he glared at Wei Yuan out of the corner of his eye.

After an agonizing quarter of an hour, the elderly eunuch returned and whispered in the emperor’s ear.

The Emperor Yuanjing was silent for a long time before slowly saying, “Summon the arcanists of the Sitianjian to the palace for questioning. We are weary. Ministers, please retire to the side hall for now.”

He fixed his gaze on Chu Xianglong and said coldly, “You stay.”

With that, he rose first and left the study.

The officials followed the eunuchs to the side hall to rest.

…

In the Side Hall.

The Minister of Revenue sipped his tea and glanced at Wei Yuan, whose expression was impassive. Testing the waters, he asked, “Duke Wei, is this matter true?”

The other officials turned to Wei Yuan. He maintained a serious demeanour and gave the minister a cold look. “Does Minister Zhao think this official is joking?”

“No no, definitely not.”

The Minister of Revenue sighed. “If this “blood runs three thousand miles” is true, how many lives must have been lost in the northern borders? The Nightwatchers have informants everywhere—why was there no news?”

Wei Yuan ignored the probing.

Prime Minister Wang squinted slightly, his fingers tapping lightly on the table as if lost in thought.

Two sticks of incense later, the elderly eunuch entered the side hall and announced, “His Majesty summons the ministers back to the study.”

In the Imperial Study, the white-clad arcanists summoned from the Sitianjian questioned Chu Xianglong. The answers were unexpected—everything Chu Xianglong said was true. 

The Zhenbei King had indeed won a major victory against the barbarians, but their guerrilla tactics had severely strained the northern forces.

The main barbarian army had been kept beyond the borders, so the supposed bloodbath of three thousand miles never occurred.

The atmosphere in the study instantly relaxed, and everyone exhaled deeply.

“Hmph!”

Chu Xianglong snorted coldly. “I wonder where Duke Wei got his information, almost causing His Majesty and the ministers to misunderstand the Zhenbei King. Did His Highness offend Duke Wei somehow?”

Wei Yuan ignored him and stepped forward, speaking firmly, “This matter is of great importance. The man’s claim may be true, even if the northern situation does not entirely match.”

Chu Xianglong bristled and was about to retort when Prime Minister Wang stepped forward to support him.

“Your Majesty, I believe Duke Wei is correct. Such a matter cannot be taken lightly. A thorough investigation is necessary.”

With the Prime Minister and Wei Yuan leading the charge, the ministers quickly voiced their agreement.

The Emperor Yuanjing pondered and asked, “My lords, wow should we investigate this matter?”

Prime Minister Wang suggested, “Your Majesty could continue gathering provisions and funds for the north while sending a special envoy team to conduct a thorough investigation.”

Wei Yuan added, “Your servant seconds the motion.”

The emperor nodded. “So be it.”

…

Xu Manor.

Susu sat under the eaves with her parasol shielding her from the sun, watching Little Pea practicing her horse stance in the courtyard. 

In the adjacent hall, Li Miaozhen chatted with the Xu Family’s matron and daughter.

Auntie and Xu Lingyue were initially displeased to hear about another guest staying over. Auntie worried the house was turning into a charity, while Xu Lingyue felt a threat to her own standing from the beautiful new arrivals.

The Daoist-robed woman was striking enough, but the white-clad lady outside, as pure as snow, made Xu Lingyue feel utterly inadequate.

However, upon learning that Li Miaozhen was Xu Qi’an’s savior, Auntie and Xu Lingyue’s attitudes softened, and they expressed genuine gratitude.

“Truly a martial family,” Li Miaozhen complimented, gesturing toward the young girl in the courtyard. “Starting her martial training so young—it’s admirable.”

Auntie sighed and said, “I only wish she’d study a little instead. It doesn’t need to be poetry, chess, calligraphy, and painting—just enough to be well-mannered. But alas, she’s a silly child.”

*The child may seem slow-witted, but how could she be truly foolish? Wasn’t Xu Qi’an’s cousin a student of Cloud Deer Academy? Yet he doesn’t teach his sister to read?* Li Miaozhen thought for a moment, then offered:  

"Since I’m staying at the Xu residence for a while, I can help give the young lady some basic education in my free time."  

Her reasoning was simple: Xu Xinnian was likely too busy with his studies to teach his younger sister, and Xu Qi’an and Xu Pingzhi, both being warriors, would naturally emphasise martial training over academics for the family’s young lady.  

It wouldn’t hurt to teach the child for a while—it wouldn’t interfere with anything else.  

Auntie paused, about to decline, when Xu Lingyue pre-emptively accepted, her smile gentle and reserved. "Then we must thank Daoist Li."  

Li Miaozhen, finding the graceful young woman likable, returned the smile. "It’s no trouble at all."  

After speaking, she noticed a hint of pity and sympathy in the gaze Auntie directed at her.  

---  

“Big Sister, Big Sister, are you really a ghost?”  

Xu Lingyin stood in a horse stance, her short, stubby legs trembling slightly. She craned her neck to look up at Susu on the roof.  

“Yes, I am. I eat people. Aren’t you afraid?” Susu tried to frighten her.  
“I am!” Xu Lingyin’s face showed a hint of fear.  

Susu chuckled smugly, humming a little tune as she stared off into the blue sky, daydreaming.  

Time passed, and before long, the two girls—one big, one small—were gone from the courtyard.  

“Big Sister, Big Sister…”  

A call came from below. Susu looked down to see the little girl standing at the base of the eaves, her bright, black-and-white eyes staring up at her.  

“Can you come down here?” the child asked.  

Susu drifted lightly into the courtyard and looked down at Xu Lingyin’s little head. "What do you want?" she asked, annoyed.  

Xu Lingyin said nothing, waving her hand to beckon Susu closer.  

Confused but curious, Susu followed her all the way to the kitchen, the smell of cooking wafting through the air. Little Bean struggled to step over the threshold and turned back, saying, "Big Sister, come in."  

Inside, the Southern Marches’ little dark-skinned girl was tending the fire, the pot above bubbling with hot oil. Xu Lingyin pulled Susu toward the pot and, face full of anticipation, asked:  

"Big Sister, can you get in by yourself?"  

Susu’s expression suddenly froze.  

---  

When Xu Qi’an returned from duty, he introduced Li Miaozhen to Xu Pingzhi. At first, Second Uncle assumed this was just another of his nephew’s friends and nodded solemnly, maintaining the airs of an elder.  

He asked steadily, “Where does Daoist Li practice her cultivation?”  

“She’s none other than the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect, one of the protagonists in the Conflict of Heaven and Man,” Xu Qi’an casually added.  

“...”  

Xu Pingzhi nearly stood up to salute and shout, *Greetings, Miss  Holy Maiden!*  

“We met in Yunzhou…” Xu Qi’an explained briefly.  

Xu Pingzhi nodded dumbly, his mind a storm of emotion.  

*Dalang knows the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect? His network keeps expanding, and his strength keeps growing. Meanwhile, I’ve just broken into the Refining Spirit stage… Truly, he is remarkable.*  

Second Uncle felt both pride and a twinge of loss at the growing disparity between himself and his nephew. But then he glanced at his son, who was poised to become an official after the imperial exams. Though not as meteoric as Ningyan’s rise, it was still an extraordinary accomplishment.  

*I’ve done well by the ancestors, though. It’s a shame my elder brother didn’t live to see his son and nephew achieve such success…*  

Just then, Xu Xinnian said gravely, "Big Brother, Miss Wang has invited me for another lakeside outing."  

*Is the Wang family girl interested in our Erlang?* Xu Qi’an’s heart stirred, his suspicion growing stronger.  

During the civil service examination scandal, Miss Wang had tipped him off with accurate and timely information—a highly unusual gesture.  

And now, linking it to the second invitation, he was almost certain Miss Wang harbored feelings for Xu Xinnian and was making bold moves to show her interest.  

"Did you agree to go?" Xu Qi’an asked with a smile.  

Xu Xinnian scoffed, “I used the upcoming imperial exams as an excuse to decline.”  

"Well done, Erlang." Xu Qi’an patted his shoulder. "A role model for our generation."  

*Role model? What a poor choice of words—classic uneducated Big Brother…* Xu Xinnian sneered internally, quietly mocking him in return.  

…

After dinner, Xu Qi’an approached Li Miaozhen’s room. Just as he was about to knock, he overheard Susu complaining inside:  

"Master, the children here are terrifying. She… she wants to eat me. She even heated a pot of oil."  

“Childish talk and actions, nothing more. Don’t take it seriously,” Li Miaozhen replied absentmindedly.  

“No! I can feel she’s not joking. The way she stared at me—it was serious…” Susu rambled on. Noticing Li Miaozhen’s lack of interest, she huffed angrily and shouted, "Stupid man! Your sister wants to eat me!"  

As soon as she finished, the door swung open. Susu stood there, hands on her hips, cheeks puffed out, glaring at him.  

*Ah, I remember now. Auntie told her once that fried ghosts were delicious, and the silly child took it seriously… and remembered all this time.*  

*So why is her memory so sharp when it comes to nonsense like this, but she can’t memorise even the simplest classics?* Xu Qi’an silently grumbled, deflecting, "Susu, didn’t you once say you’d become my concubine for three years if I fulfilled two of your requests?"  

Li Miaozhen immediately shot Susu a sharp glare.  

The coquettish ghost, more enchanting than her mistress, folded her arms and replied, “That’s right! Rebuild my body and uncover the truth behind my father’s execution.  

"If you do, I’ll not only become your concubine for three years—I’ll even bear you a son."  

In reality, whether or not she became a concubine was not important to him; the reason why Xu Qi’an agreed to investigate for her was that he felt teasing a ghost was a little too much.

*Obviously I have to get Song Qing to make her a 36D body, but I don’t really care either way, however hard things are, I can’t make things hard for my child…* he thought, before looking towards Li Miaozhen.

“First of all, tell me what you know already.”

The Master and Servant’s expressions became serious. Li Miaozhen said: “Susu was born in Jiangzhou, her father was the Jiangzhou Prefect. In Yuanjing 15, he was indicted and beheaded, and his family’s women were sent to the Jiaofangsi.

“Her mother had a strong personality, and refused to become a courtesan in the Jiaofangsi. Hence, she poisoned all the women in her family, including Susu. However, Susu did have one younger brother, who was far away studying, who managed to escape this calamity.

“When coming to the capital, I took Susu on a detour around Jiangzhou, to try investigate past happenings, and discovered something strange.”
