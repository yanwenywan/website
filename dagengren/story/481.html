# 481. Preparations Beforehand

*Heaven and Earth Society, Daoist Jinlian truly had a talent for naming things...*[^1] Xu Qi’an sighed inwardly, then began to explain his plan in detail.

As he listened, Chu Yuanzhen suddenly felt something was amiss and sent a message:

【Wait, what makes you the main force? Even if you’ve advanced to the Fourth Rank, you can’t possibly be a match for Zhende.】

Everyone suddenly came to their senses.

Especially Li Miaozhen, who had witnessed Xu Qi’an’s advancement to the Fourth Rank, nobody understood Xu Qi’an better than her.

No matter how invincible he was at Fourth Rank, Fourth Rank was still Fourth Rank, still mortal, and the gap to Third Rank, which had blocked countless martial artists, was simply too great.

Zhende, on the other hand, was a second rank Daoist cultivator.

There was a world of difference between the two major realms.

Xu Qi’an sent a message: 【I’m Third Rank now.】

*???*

The members of the Heaven and Earth Society were once again hit by a tidal wave of shock, their minds full of question marks.

*What did I just hear? This kid is Third Rank now?! Has he been hanging around the Confucians so long that he’s picked up their habit of boasting...* Chu Yuanzhen was stunned.

*Piece of-, this is too much. When we first met in Yunzhou, you were just an Eighth Rank little Bronze Gong!* Li Miaozhen’s soul screamed inside her body.

The others were each shocked in their own way.

At that moment, everyone in the Heaven and Earth Society involuntarily recalled the scene when Number Three had first obtained the Earth Book fragment. Back then, he was just a small figure who trembled in fear before Daoist Zilian.

That was in October last year.

It had only just been a year, almost exactly. In just one year, he had stepped out from the realm of mortals and become a true greater being.

A Third Rank martial artist possessed immense vitality and longevity, living for several hundred years without issue.

No longer a mere mortal.

Could anyone really go from Eighth Rank to Third Rank in just a year? Not even the Confucian Sage back then was likely to have had such ability...

Everyone in the Heaven and Earth Society had their own opportunities, and each was a prodigy in their own right, but they had to admit, in front of Xu Qi’an, they really did seem rather ordinary.

*Why is no one speaking? Have you all gone silent...* Seeing that no one spoke for a long while, Xu Qi’an sent another message:

【Brother Chu, when you return to the capital, remember to bring Erlang back with you. Send him to Cloud Deer Academy to meet up with my second uncle and auntie.】

*The property deeds for the house and land in Jianzhou were bought in secret when he went to Mount Quanrong, he had told no one. He had gone alone to Mount Quanrong...*

Thinking of this, Xu Qi’an frowned, feeling as if he had forgotten something.

*Back then, Cao Qingyang invited me to Quanrong Mountain for a banquet, so I went alone. On the way I bought a house, and then I saw the Wulin Alliance's old ancestor... huh? There's no issue there.*

【FOUR: Understood, I’ll return to the capital overnight. Have the Sitianjian prepare some qi-supplementing pills for me.】

If he risked death from exhaustion and went all out on his sword, he could return to the capital within six hours. It would be late at night by then, but he could take a short rest and replenish his energy with pills, so it wouldn’t delay important matters.

Ending the group chat, Xu Qi’an put away the Earth Book fragment and drew the Taiping sabre with a reverse grip, slash!, and cut off his own little finger.

*Even without using the Invincible Vajra Body, it’s already difficult to injure my flesh with just the sharpness of the Taiping sabre. I must channel my qi to transform it into sabre energy!*

Xu Qi’an nodded, extremely satisfied with his current physique.

Immediately, he felt the wound on his little finger, his cells were dividing at a terrifying rate, trying to heal the injury.

He forcibly resisted this “instinct,” picked up the little finger, and placed it against the stump.

The flesh squirmed, his little finger reattached, perfectly restored, without a scar.

He examined himself: *Every cell of a Third Rank martial artist is filled with an immense vitality. If I had a microscope, my cells would definitely be different from ordinary humans.*

*Uh, would this make me infertile?! Surely not, there are half-yao in this world, which means the rules of reproductive isolation don’t apply here. Just look at Song Qing’s terrifying life-grafting technique. I was so scared at the time I didn’t even think about it...*

*It’s a ninety-percent chance of death, no, a hundred percent, for a Fourth Rank martial artist to devour a blood pill to advance. No wonder so few dare take this path, and no wonder there are so many martial artists in the Great Feng, yet only Zhenbei King reached Third Rank.*

*And the method of refining blood pills with tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of living people is beyond the comprehension of crude martial artists. This secret art is controlled by the Daoists. Back then, King Huai succeeded only with the help of the Daoist Leader of the Earth Sect. As for whether the warlocks and arcanists know it, that remains unclear.*

*As for my case, having a peak martial artist voluntarily sacrifice some of their blood essence to help me advance with a blood pill, well, what can I say, my dad is just too good. Mm, the Jianzheng also played a part. Without his arrangements, I couldn’t have laid the foundations so early.*

*Duke Wei’s gift was out of affection and heritage. As for the Jianzheng’s, I don’t know the reason, but now I understand part of it. Hah, it’s all just to kill the emperor. The dynasty is the arcanists’ foundation. The Jianzheng killing the emperor will inevitably draw fortune’s backlash.*

*But I’m different. I’m just a martial artist and already bear fortune myself, so I don’t fear the backlash. Still, killing the emperor will surely entangle me in karma.*

He fiddled with his little finger, thinking back on the state of his body just now.

*After reaching Third Rank, not only can a martial artist regrow severed limbs, they can also reattach lost ones. The former consumes their own blood essence, and if one keeps regenerating limbs, they would eventually become exhausted and die from the strain.*

*The latter consumes very little, since it does not require recreating the body. In addition, at the early stage of Third Rank, if your head was cut off, you would still die, because your primordial spirit is not yet strong enough. That's my situation right now.*

*At mid-stage Third Rank, when the primordial spirit catches up with the body, even if the head is cut off, I can grow a new one, and as long as the primordial spirit returns, I would survive. But in such a case, if my primordial spirit was targeted by a warlock or Daoist expert, there's still a high risk of perishing.*

*Moreover, if I were dismembered and my body parts could not be quickly reunited, even as a Third Rank, the natural healing would cause excessive loss of blood essence, leading to death. In other words, dismemberment is the best way to kill a high-ranked martial artist.*

*Hiss~ Thinking about it, just how terrifying was Shenshu?*

*Shenshu had been dismembered and sealed in Sangpo lake for five hundred years, and yet in those five hundred years, his blood essence has not drained away, and he still has vitality. In addition, Shenshu’s primordial spirit has also endured for five centuries without being extinguished...*

The higher one’s cultivation, the more one understood just how frightening Shenshu was.

*Just how strong was Shenshu at his peak? Could he defeat the old Jianzheng with a single punch?*

Xu Qi’an took a step into the air and, with an explosive burst of qi, soared away.

A Third Rank martial artist could use qi to fly, but among the various means of flight, this was forced flight, with the highest energy cost and the slowest speed, within the same rank, it was the slowest.

However, on land, martial artists were the fastest.

Even arcanists who could teleport would be caught up by a martial artist’s explosive power in close-range combat unless they teleported dozens of miles at a time.

Then, a flurry of close-range attacks would finish them off.

Soon, the capital was in sight.

Xu Qi’an landed, disguised himself as the devilishly handsome man from his previous life, and merged into the bustling crowd, becoming just another face among the masses.

He returned to the Stargazing Tower, leapt onto the Bagua Platform in one go, and landed steadily beside the Jianzheng in the howling wind with a soft “tap”.

“Where’s Senior Brother Yang?” Xu Qi’an asked the old Jianzheng.

“I'm afraid he can't take the blow, so I locked him underground,” replied the Jianzheng expressionlessly.

*Life was already so hard, couldn’t you let me have a bit of fun at Senior Brother Yang’s expense...* Xu Qi’an muttered, then said, “I’m Third Rank now, sorry for the trouble.”

The Jianzheng nodded and smacked Xu Qi’an on the head.

…

The wheels rumbled.

A luxurious rosewood carriage stopped outside Lingbao Temple.

Xu Qi’an, now in disguise, climbed out of Lin’an’s carriage. The seductive young lady carefully lifted her skirt and, with Xu Qi’an’s support, gracefully jumped down.

Biaobiao elegantly walked to the entrance of Lingbao Temple, lifted her chin slightly, and spoke in a sweet voice, “We wish to see the National Teacher, mm, is our royal father here?”

“His Majesty is not inside,” the young Daoist boy at the gate replied at once, then hurried inside to deliver the message. After a while, he returned quickly and said, “Your Highness, the National Teacher awaits you.”

Biaobiao led Xu Qi’an inside.

“Your Highness, tomorrow, whatever happens, do not hate me...”

With her enchanting eyes fluttering, Biaobiao said in a sweet voice, “I won’t... Are you getting engaged?!”

Her voice suddenly rose.

Xu Qi’an shook his head, wanting to take her hand but reconsidered, perhaps the big shark was already “watching”.

A mature sea king, trident in hand, had to know when to spear the right fish at the right moment.

Now was obviously not the time, the scent of blood would provoke the ferocity of the big shark inside.

Nearing Luo Yuheng’s tranquil little courtyard, he left Lin’an waiting outside and entered, pushing open the door to Luo Yuheng’s meditation room.

The mature and coolly beautiful National Teacher sat cross-legged on a mat, eyes half closed, a red mark between her brows lending her stunning features an ethereal aura.

“I’m Third Rank now,” Xu Qi’an said softly.

Luo Yuheng’s eyes snapped open, fixing on him with a blazing gaze.

Her heart trembled so violently that she almost lost control of her expression, dramatic emotions flickering across her pale, striking face.

“How did you do it?”

Luo Yuheng unconsciously lowered her voice, as if discussing some secret.

“Before he left for war, Duke Wei left me a blood pill,” Xu Qi’an replied by sound transmission. “Also, I’ve already solved the case of the late emperor Zhende.”

He recounted everything to Luo Yuheng, detail by detail.

After a long silence, Luo Yuheng nodded slowly, half sighing, half murmuring, “So that’s how it is.”

Xu Qi’an spoke directly, “I intend to kill the emperor, but on my own, I’m afraid I can’t match the former emperor. I ask the National Teacher for your help.”

Killing the emperor, he meant to kill not only Yuanjing, but also Zhende.

Luo Yuheng gave no answer. Her voice was crisp and cold:

“The Jianzheng will never strike at an emperor. This is because arcanists and the dynasty are inseparable. To kill an emperor would cost the Jianzheng too much. Otherwise, past emperors would never have trusted him so much.

“However, after Third Rank, experts of any path would be unwilling to strike at a mortal emperor. For to kill someone blessed with great fortune is to suffer the backlash of fortune.

“I am at a critical juncture and cannot bear that backlash. You... why are you taking your trousers off?!”

Luo Yuheng frowned slightly, this rascal had actually taken off his coat and was unfastening his belt in front of her.

“Hasn’t the National Teacher always wanted to dual cultivate with me? I can’t miss the opportunity,” Xu Qi’an replied with a straight face.

Then he saw the Leader of the Human Sect, the National Teacher of the Great Feng, that stunningly beautiful woman, blush with two rosy patches on her cheeks.

Luo Yuheng gave him a complicated look. “You, you knew all along...”

Xu Qi’an nodded, “Daoist Jinlian told me.”

No matter if Daoist Jinlian was a good man or a bad wolf, better to throw him under the bus first.

Luo Yuheng’s brows arched sharply and she looked aside, saying coolly,

“Though I did have such an intention... it’s not as if it had to be you. Matters of Dao companions are not to be taken lightly.”

Her expression and tone were cold, but her hesitant speech betrayed her.

*The National Teacher is still, at heart, a girl who values ceremony! Not to be taken lightly, well, of course I’d bathe, I wouldn’t skip any of the steps...* Xu Qi’an grumbled inwardly, stopped undoing his belt, and laughed:

“After committing regicide, I’ll be the National Teacher’s man.”

He had done this simply to be frank with Luo Yuheng, she desired his body, he sought her help, and, admittedly, he was rather attracted to her as well... It was more like a transaction of interests.

Still, Xu Qi’an had a good impression of Luo Yuheng and did not mind doing the deed first and letting feelings develop later.

As the ancients said: Affection grows over time!

Luo Yuheng’s eyes glistened with rare embarrassment and annoyance. She said coolly, “I’ll act tomorrow. Get out!”

Xu Qi’an bowed and withdrew from the meditation room.

Leaving the courtyard, Biaobiao came up, chattering, “What did you and the National Teacher talk about?”

Xu Qi’an replied truthfully, “I wanted to invite the National Teacher to dual cultivate, but she refused.”

Biaobiao rolled her eyes.

Xu Qi’an added, “She believes matters of Dao companions are not to be taken lightly, she wants me to marry her in grand style.”

Biaobiao giggled like a little hen, “You’re still in Lingbao Temple, be careful, the National Teacher might hear and hold it against you.”

Xu Qi’an glanced at her, *one day, you’ll stop laughing.*

“Next, take me to Wang Manor,” he said.

…

After Wang Zhenwen returned home, he immediately ordered his family to pack, from clothes to antiques, furniture, and calligraphy, all stuffed into boxes.

His family was baffled, but realised something major had happened.

Second Master Wang plucked up the courage to ask a few times, but got no answer and dared not ask again.

He kept urging his father’s favourite younger sister to gather information.

Wang Simu, piecing together recent court events and her father’s efforts to defend Wei Yuan’s reputation, came to a conclusion.

There were two possibilities: either her father intended to resign, or His Majesty meant to force his resignation.

This residence was a royal gift, located in the imperial city. Unlike the hereditary mansions of ennobled families, a civil official’s state-bestowed residence would be repossessed by the court once he retired.

For nobility, when the patriarch died, the heir succeeded, and the royal residence could be passed down.

*But that's not right, given Father's relationship with Wei Yuan, even if they admired each other as heroes, they are still political enemies. There's no need to go this far...* Wang Simu frowned, scolding:

“Second Brother, you’re being annoying. Go away.”

Second Master Wang immediately fell silent, sulking and leaving in a huff.

At that moment, a servant reported, “Miss, Princess Lin’an has arrived.”

Wang Simu was a little surprised, but got up at once to greet her. She and Lin’an were half-friends and met frequently.

In the reception hall, she saw the second princess in a red dress, oval face, peach-blossom eyes, as captivating as ever.

“Your Highness!”

Wang Simu bowed in greeting, observing Lin’an’s mood. In fact, Princess Huaiqing played a crucial role in their friendship.

Princess Lin’an loved to make mischief and act coquettishly, but apart from charming Emperor Yuanjing, she had no special skills.

It wasn’t until she met Wang Simu that she gained a wily strategist and often asked Wang Simu for ideas to trouble Huaiqing.

Although most of Wang Simu’s plans ended up backfiring on Lin’an, sometimes they caused considerable harm to Huaiqing.

“Simu!”

Lin’an greeted her with a bright smile, “We wish to see the Prime Minister.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Xu Qi’an in disguise.

Wang Simu, ever observant, instantly noticed and studied Xu Qi’an.

Utterly unremarkable, both looks and bearing were average.

But if this man could be brought by Princess Lin’an’s side, his identity must be extraordinary.

At that moment, she heard the ordinary-looking man laugh and say,

“Oh, sister-in-law.”
