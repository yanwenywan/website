# 317. How to Solve This? (Long)

Half an hour later, Xu Qi'an stepped out of the Tower of Noble Spirit. He paused at the base of the tower, took a moment to collect himself, and then left with a decisive aura.

Leaving the constabulary, he mounted his mare and galloped along the city’s vast central avenue, speeding toward the Ministry of Law.

This main road was over a hundred meters wide and led directly to the Imperial City. Its width primarily served to prevent assassins from setting up ambushes; in the event of an attack, the broad path would give the imperial guards ample time to react.

Before long, he arrived at the Ministry of Law.

From a distance, Xu Qi'an spotted his Second Uncle, Xu Pingzhi, who was clad in armor and wielding a weapon. He must have received the news while on patrol and rushed over immediately.

Xu Pingzhi was blocked at the entrance by the guards of the Ministry of Law.

Two guards berated him loudly, and one of them gave Xu Pingzhi a fierce shove. Unable to retaliate, he staggered back.

“What? A mere Captain of the Imperial Guard thinks he can force his way into the Ministry of Law?” One guard sneered, pointing at Xu Pingzhi's nose. “Get lost, or don’t blame me for getting rough.”

Xu Pingzhi, who was in the Refining Qi stage, clenched his fists tightly, swallowing his frustration as he said in a low voice, “I am Xu Xinnian’s father. I have the right to see my son.”

The other guard mocked him, “An examination fraud criminal is not allowed visitors. That’s always been the rule. A coarse man like you wouldn’t understand.”

Xu Pingzhi truly didn’t know—the intricacies of examination fraud cases were far removed from his world.

“Then why did you ask me for thirty taels?” Xu Pingzhi’s brow furrowed with anger.

“We just felt like extorting you. So what? This is the Ministry of Law. You dare start something here? Go ahead and try.” The guard smirked.

“Hah… tui!” The other guard went a step further, spitting in Xu Pingzhi’s direction.

Xu Pingzhi quickly sidestepped it.

The two guards burst into raucous laughter.

“Whew…” Xu Pingzhi took a deep breath, looking at the two rows of soldiers inside the gate. It was clear that if he caused a scene at the Ministry’s gate, he would get the worst of it.

“Get lost!” The guard looked down on him with disdain.

Just then, the rapid clatter of hooves echoed from afar. They turned to see a swift steed charging towards them, brazenly barreling toward the entrance of the Ministry of Law.

It charged straight at the two sneering guards.

Bang!

One guard, unable to dodge in time, was struck in the chest by the mare and sent flying, landing heavily and struggling before collapsing, too injured to get back up.

Someone actually dared to commit violence outside the Ministry of Law?

“Ningyan!” Xu Pingzhi’s face lit up in relief when he saw his nephew.

“Clang…” The sound of drawn blades filled the air as guards within the Ministry of Law rushed out, intent on slicing the audacious Silver Gong who dared cause a ruckus at their gates.

But when they recognized Xu Qi'an on the horse, they all froze.

The lead guard sheathed his blade, cupped his fists, and said sternly, “Sir Xu, this is the Ministry of Law. Be aware that assaulting guards here could lead to imprisonment, exile, or even execution.”

Ignoring him, Xu Qi'an dismounted, then kicked over the other guard who had managed to dodge the mare’s charge.

“Ow…” The guard cried out, rolling on the ground.

Xu Qi'an unfastened his saber and held it in his hand, using the scabbard to administer a thorough beating. The dull thuds of scabbard against flesh made everyone’s heart skip a beat.

The guard cried out incessantly in pain.

“Sir Xu!” the lead guard finally shouted.

“Address me as Viscount,” Xu Qi'an corrected coldly.

The guard captain hesitated, ignored the correction, and shouted, “Do you truly believe the Ministry lacks experts? Do you not fear the Emperor’s wrath or the laws of the Great Feng?”

“Send whoever you like,” Xu Qi'an sneered. “If I can’t settle this matter, I may as well leave the capital in disgrace.” He continued to thrash the guard.

At first, the guard tried to evade or block the strikes, but after a dozen blows, his eyes began to roll back, barely clinging to consciousness.

The guard captain gritted his teeth, his hand gripping his sword tightly, yet he dared not move against this fierce Silver Gong.

He still remembered the scenes from the contest that had only recently taken place. Xu Qi'an's reputation was yet fresh in everyone’s minds, and no one would want to provoke him at such a time.

More importantly, this man bore an imperial pardon, protecting his life even if he caused a bloodbath at the Ministry’s gates. At most, he would be stripped of his position, but his life would remain secure.

Once the guard was on his last breath, Xu Qi'an finally stopped and sheathed his saber. “Thirty taels will cover the doctor’s fees and medicine for the two of you,” he said calmly.

With that, he turned to the captain. “Go inside and inform them I wish to see Xu Xinnian.”

Without protest or response, the captain signaled for his men to carry the two injured guards inside for treatment. He cast a long look at Xu Qi'an before retreating into the Ministry.

After a short while, the captain returned and said, “Minister Sun has granted you an audience.”

Xu Qi'an tied his horse to the stone lion at the entrance, then gestured to Xu Pingzhi. “Second Uncle, let’s go in.”

Xu Pingzhi followed in silence. The guard led the uncle and nephew through the outer court and corridors, where Xu Pingzhi, wanting to say something, ultimately held his tongue.

They entered a side hall, where Minister Sun, dressed in a scarlet robe, awaited with a stern expression.

“Greetings, Minister Sun,” Xu Qi'an said with a bow.

Minister Sun’s gaze remained cold, as if he didn’t even see Xu Qi'an, and he replied, “You left out two words.”

Xu Qi'an stared at him for a moment before bowing lower, adopting a subservient tone. “This humble servant greets Minister Sun. I wish to see Xu Xinnian.”

Seeing this, Xu Pingzhi’s eyes reddened slightly.

Minister Sun, satisfied, replied, “Examination fraud is a grave crime, but family visitation is understandable.”

Then his tone shifted abruptly, “Denied.”

… Xu Pingzhi gritted his teeth in frustration.

Without sparing them another glance, Minister Sun lifted his tea, signaling the end of the audience.

“Sorry to trouble you, Minister Sun.” Xu Qi'an turned to leave.

Watching the uncle and nephew depart, Minister Sun remarked coldly, “There are some cane switches in the courtyard. I heard, Sir Xu, that you have mastered the Buddhist Golden Body. Care to try them?”

Xu Qi'an walked on without looking back.

As they exited the Ministry, Xu Pingzhi cursed, “That son of a bitch! Wanting you to kneel and beg with a cane? I’d sooner draw my blade on him!”

“How did you arrive so quickly, Second Uncle?” Xu Qi'an asked.

“You took too long! I hurried home to console your Auntie and Lingyue after receiving the news, but it was pointless…” Xu Pingzhi sighed. “All they did was cry and wail. Ningyan, what are we going to do about this?”

Though Xu Pingzhi was just a rough military man, he knew of the long-standing rivalry between the Imperial Academy and Cloud Deer Academy. Along the way, he’d thought things through and figured this arrest of Erlang likely had something to do with it.

“This situation is very complicated. Second Uncle, you should head back. I have other matters to handle.”

Xu Qi’an didn’t want to waste time, so he mounted his little mare and rode swiftly along the street, the clip-clop of hooves echoing as he went.

In his mind, he recalled Wei Yuan’s words:

*Step one: prevent the Ministry of Law from extracting a confession by torture. The prefectural magistrate, Magistrate Chen, is a slick official who maneuvers deftly between different factions. If this case is pinned down, he’ll likely refrain from offending Minister Sun.*

*Minister Sun loathes me deeply. The imperial examination scandal gives him the perfect opportunity for revenge. It’s possible he even orchestrated this, or at the very least, is complicit. Hoping he’ll treat Erlang fairly is almost out of the question.*

The little mare worked up a sheen of sweat, panting as it finally halted before a courtyard in the outer city.

“Daoist! Daoist, help me!” Xu Qi’an pushed open the gate and strode into the inner room, finding Daoist Jinlian lying peacefully on the bed, as if fast asleep.

*Again… again with the cat body…* Xu Qi’an, who had been anxious just moments ago, couldn’t help the twitch in his mouth at the sight.

Remembering the last time his little mare had kicked him in irritation—and mindful that he had a favour to ask—Xu Qi’an refrained from waking Daoist Jinlian by force, choosing instead to sit at the table and wait quietly. In less than three minutes, a slender figure appeared at the doorway.

“What’s the matter?” Daoist Jinlian squatted at the threshold, his voice calm and gentle, seemingly used to conversing in this feline form.

“My cousin, Xu Xinnian, has been caught up in an imperial examination scandal…” Xu Qi’an explained the sequence of events and then added, “Daoist, I need your help.”

The amber eyes of the orange cat gleamed as it regarded him, voice resonating through the air, “I don’t know enough about the inner workings of the Great Feng’s bureaucracy to offer effective advice. You shouldn’t be asking me for this. Wei Yuan is the true master of political manoeuvring. If court politics were divided into ranks, Wei Yuan would be second rank.”

Xu Qi’an, initially anxious, couldn’t help but follow this tangent, “Only second rank? Then who’s first?”

The orange cat chuckled, “Naturally, Emperor Yuanjing. In terms of imperial strategy, he’s unmatched. Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen both have the potential to reach first rank in political strategy, but their philosophies differ, and their views are incompatible.

“Emperor Yuanjing deliberately placed two tigers in the court, standing back himself as the ultimate spectator, watching the tiger fight unfold.”

*That makes sense… Wait a minute, didn’t you say you weren’t well-versed in court affairs?* Xu Qi’an silently cursed, but aloud he asked, “So, Daoist, do you think there’s a level of political mastery that transcends ranks?”

“Of course,” Daoist Jinlian lifted his paw and licked it thoughtfully. “The highest level of political mastery is to crush all opposition with sheer power, to speak with unchallengeable authority that no one dares defy. Every founding emperor of a dynasty has possessed this quality.”

*The Daoist seems to be getting more influenced by his cat instincts… Indeed, every creature is ruled by its body, with its hormones dictating its actions. When hungry, you eat; when tired, you sleep; when thirsty, you drink. When the treasury is full, you distribute wealth to your female devotees. So, here’s the question: does Daoist Jinlian prefer kitties or cats?*

At that moment, the orange cat sighed, lowering its paw, and said, “You seem to enjoy walking on a knife’s edge.”

*And dancing along it repeatedly?* Xu Qi’an thought of this phrase instinctively but hurriedly steered the topic back, saying, “Daoist, I’d like to ask for a favour…”

…

Following the canal south of the capital, about ten li out of the city, lay a lake. Mist veiled the surface, and lush mountains bordered it. Lotus flowers spread across the lake, creating a breathtaking scene.

The lakeshore was dotted with farmers’ homes, teahouses, and wine pavilions. As it was close to the capital and easily accessible by boat, the area bustled each spring with young scholars and noble ladies eager to admire the scenery.

A graceful embroidered boat rested by the shore, where Wang Simu, dressed to impress, awaited in a current fashion: a wide-sleeved, gauzy gown. The subtle, intricate patterns, with matching colors, were elegant yet restrained.

Her makeup was delicate, her hair arranged in an elaborate chignon adorned with golden pins and jade hairpieces, a full ensemble for a date.

Yet an hour had passed, and while others had already completed a round-trip of the lake, Miss Wang’s boat remained at the dock, souring her mood.

“Miss, let’s go back,” her maid urged quietly. “It seems Huiyuan Xu won’t be coming.”

“Did you not deliver the message properly?” Wang Simu shot her maid a gentle glare, refusing to accept reality as she tried to pin the blame on Xu Xinnian.

“I wouldn’t dare! I delivered it for sure,” the maid replied, aggrieved.

Wang Simu sat in silence for a long time, her gaze dimming as she murmured, “Fine, let’s go back.”

“Yes,” the maid replied, then hurried to the back of the boat to inform the boatman to turn around.

The boatmen raised anchor and rowed in unison, guiding the embroidered boat down the canal toward the capital.

Once at the capital dock, Wang Simu climbed into the waiting carriage, instructing, “Lan’er, head to the Xu residence right away. Tell them I’m visiting Miss Lingyue.”

“I’ll wait here for half an hour before setting off.”

“Miss, why do this?” the maid frowned, confused.

“Even if he has no interest in me, I’ll find out for sure.” Miss Wang was determined.

…

Xu Xinnian, first-ranked in the spring imperial examination, was arrested by the Ministry of Law on suspicion of cheating and thrown into prison.

This case, bound to rock the capital, spread from the prefectural office and the Ministry of Law, through the Six Ministries, and soon permeated the entire capital’s official circles.

In the following days, the story would undoubtedly reach everyone’s ears.

During the noon break, officials and clerks who knew each other gathered in teahouses and winehouses, discussing the scandal.

“I knew it. The scholars of Cloud Deer Academy scoring the highest rank in the imperial exams? The civil servants would never let that stand. And now, here it is.”

“You’re only half right. There’s more to this than meets the eye. Xu Xinnian is Xu Qi’an’s cousin. Xu Qi’an, the Great Feng’s Poet Laureate, wrote the masterpiece *Ode to the Difficult Road*… To say there’s no foul play? I don’t buy it.”

“Ridiculous! Is Xu Qi’an the only one capable of composing poetry? Are we scholars incapable of a flash of brilliance?”

“Enough. Arguing about this is pointless. Huiyuan Xu’s future is over, guilty or not. I recall in the twelfth year of Emperor Yuanjing’s reign, there was a similar cheating case. Three scholars were implicated. After two years, they were cleared, but their reputations were ruined, and their studies wasted.”

“In Yuanjing’s twentieth year, there was another case. That one was proven, and the scholars and the chief examiner involved were executed by imperial decree.”

“If this case is upheld, considering Xu Xinnian’s affiliation with Cloud Deer Academy… tsk, no way he can escape. Do you think Duke Wei will intervene?”

“Very likely. Xu Qi’an is Duke Wei’s confidant; he’ll certainly ask Duke Wei for help.”

“What if Duke Wei does nothing?”

“If Duke Wei won’t act, who can save Huiyuan Xu? That martial artist Xu Qi’an? Solving cases, slaying enemies—he may be skilled in those areas. But the nuances of bureaucracy? They’re beyond the grasp of a mere warrior.”

Staying at a friend’s home, Chu Yuanzhen also learned of the matter during lunch from a friend who had just returned from the Constabulary.

*Number Three has become embroiled in the civil service exam scandal… Number Three is undeniably brilliant, but the conflict between Cloud Deer Academy and the Imperial Academy is an unstoppable force, beyond the reach of mere intellect… The best possible outcome is for his rank to be stripped, and for Number Three to be barred from office—a great loss to the court…*

"I heard that the new Right Censor-in-chief submitted the impeachment, but I suspect that… yes, each Clique is either observing from the sidelines or covertly offering support. Xu Xinnian is in grave danger," said a friend.

Chu Yuanzhen sighed, his tone grave. "It was precisely my distaste for interparty conflict that led me to leave the court. Since ancient times, factional strife has sapped national strength, and emperors pursuing the Dao harm the realm’s fortune."

His friend’s face changed drastically. "Yuanzhen, be cautious with your words."

"What is there to fear? I’m already a free scholar, living my own life." Chu Yuanzhen chuckled but then sighed. "I’ve thought on this matter for a long time and found no solution. Unless Wei Yuan intervenes… Given Xu Ningyan’s potential, Wei Yuan should make a move.

"But… that’s likely what those people are hoping for. Alas, there’s no solution."

…

The imperial palace.

In Dexin Courtyard, Princess Huaiqing, dressed in a plain palace dress, sat behind her desk and nodded at the captain of the guards inside the room. "We understand. You may withdraw."

Once the guard left, Huaiqing rose, walked to the window, and frowned in contemplation. "If it were me, how would I solve this?"

She pondered for a long time, then shook her head with a sigh.

Then, she suddenly thought—*if it were Xu Ningyan, what would he do?*

…

In a restaurant in the inner city, Sun Yaoyue had reserved a booth to host his classmates from the Imperial Academy, primarily to share a piece of news that would soon rock the scholarly circles of the capital.

"The Spring Examination’s champion, Xu Xinnian, was arrested this morning on charges of cheating and bribing the examiners. My father sent people to take him in."

"Is this true?" The Imperial Academy students were stunned.

"Of course it’s true. I went to the Constabulary to confirm it myself and asked my father directly. Although he chased me out, Minister Zhu hinted as much to me. Xu Xinnian is in prison, awaiting trial." Sun Yaoyue swept his gaze across his friends, speaking with great satisfaction.

As the only legitimate heir of Minister Sun, Sun Yaoyue performed decently in his studies, far better than most spoiled noble sons, but he had a major flaw—he loved gossip.

He was both envious and resentful of Xu Xinnian, a Cloud Deer Academy student, winning the spring exams, and now that he was in prison for exam fraud, Sun couldn’t have been happier.

"That Silver Gong Xu Qi'an is a scoundrel, relying on the support of Wei the Eunuch to strut around the capital, even writing a poem to insult my father. He deserves a thousand cuts."

Sun Yaoyue slammed the table and laughed maniacally. "If we can’t cut him, we’ll cut his cousin instead! Hahaha, drink up!"

The students from the Imperial Academy, upon hearing this news, were a mix of surprise and satisfaction. Exactly! How could they let a Cloud Deer Academy student win the Spring Examination’s champion title? Where’s the dignity of the Imperial Academy scholars?

It had to be cheating. Absolutely cheating. No other reason was acceptable.

"Brother Sun, it’s better to share this joy than to savor it alone. Such delightful news should spread far and wide!"

"You’re absolutely right. That’s what we’ll do. Tonight, at the Jiaofangsi."

After the feast, a drunken Sun Yaoyue left the restaurant and climbed into a carriage, with attendants helping him in.

Just as he intended to nap briefly, he saw a sleek, slender orange cat curled up on the cushioned seat, amber eyes gazing at him coolly.

The carriage continued moving without any disturbance. Suddenly, the window opened, and the orange cat leaped out, tail upright, its little feline stride fast as it vanished into the bustling crowd.

…

The Ministry of Law.

Minister Sun summoned a clerk and asked, "Go to the prison and see if Xu Xinnian has confessed yet."

The clerk nodded and left, returning a few minutes later to report, "Minister, Xu Xinnian has quite the backbone—no matter how much he’s beaten, he refuses to confess."

"Then they haven’t beaten him hard enough," Minister Sun snorted coldly. "There’s no shortage of torture methods here at the Ministry of Law. Let him experience every one of them. Even a stone can be made to blossom—just leave him with his life."

"Yes, sir."

The clerk withdrew, and moments later, an elderly man hurried into the room, dressed in the style of a wealthy household steward. He even stumbled over the threshold in his haste.

"What are you doing here at the Constabulary?" Minister Sun frowned.

The man was the Sun family’s steward, a long-serving old servant who had been with Minister Sun for decades.

"Master, terrible news…" The steward’s face was ashen, his voice quivering. "Young Master… he’s missing."

"What do you mean, missing?"

Minister Sun’s expression changed. He strode forward, fixing the steward with a piercing stare. "What do you mean, missing?!"

"The servants who went out with him just returned to report. Today, Young Master entertained his classmates at a restaurant, then entered his carriage… but then he disappeared. The carriage returned to the manor, but no one was inside."

The steward scratched his head in panic, cautiously suggesting, "The manor’s guest scholars say, perhaps… perhaps it’s because you recently offended someone?"

There was an unspoken rule in the Great Feng court: political battles were political battles, and should never affect one’s family members. This wasn’t out of any high moral ground but because, if you break the rule, others could retaliate in kind.

Anyone violating this rule would be ostracised by the entire political class.

This unspoken rule held such authority that even the royal court acknowledged it, though it was never formally decreed.

One of the Great Feng's policies required that any official who took office in the capital had to bring their family along.

Why did this policy exist?

To pave the way for this unspoken rule, underscoring its immense authority.

*Offended someone…* Minister Sun muttered to himself, and a certain loathsome name, Xu Qi'an, surfaced in his mind.

"Fool!"

Minister Sun roared, his hair and beard bristling with fury. He bellowed, "Does he think that by kidnapping my son, he can make me submit? Ignorant wretch, a fool!

"If my son suffers even the slightest harm, I’ll raze the entire capital! No, I’ll see his entire family dead."

After his furious tirade, he swept the memorials off the desk, smashing a teacup to pieces, ink and paper scattering across the floor.

The steward stood rooted in terror, barely daring to breathe. His master had served as an official for many years and cultivated an unshakeable temperament.

For him to lose control like this had only happened twice—once over a deeply insulting poem, and both times due to that impudent Xu Qi'an.

Minister Sun suddenly gathered his robe and, with an agility that belied his age, stormed out of the room.

"Master, if there’s anything you need, just say the word, and this old servant will take care of it…"

The steward chased after him, shouting.

Minister Sun ignored him, shouting instead, "Someone, someone—get to the prison. No torture, absolutely no torture!"

His cracked voice echoed high above the Ministry of Law’s headquarters: “No torture!”

…

A quarter of an hour later, the initially agitated Minister Sun returned to the hall, panting and slightly calmer, taking the hot tea offered by the old steward and drinking deeply.

“You ignorant, foolish brat, to dare to threaten me! Idiotic, moronic!”

After cursing, Minister Sun’s tone shifted as he ordered the steward, “Head to the Nightwatcher’s constabulary immediately and have that damned dog of a rogue meet me here.”

Though he resented the breaking of rules, Minister Sun was no longer in a position to maintain his bravado. Negotiating would be the best option; his priority was ensuring his son’s safety, while settling scores with that scoundrel Xu could wait.

The steward nodded, about to leave when a guard entered, cupping his hands. “Minister Sun, Xu Qi’an has arrived.”

Perfect timing!

A gleam sparked in Minister Sun’s eyes as he straightened up and ordered, “Let him in.”

Soon, the guard escorted Xu Qi’an, wearing his Silver Gong uniform, into the hall. The son-of-a-bitch Xu wore a smug expression, strolling in with a carefree air, quite unlike his earlier visit when he had worn a grim face, suppressing his anger.

Now, Minister Sun’s expression mirrored the previous look on Xu Qi’an’s face.

“My son, Sun Yaoyue—where is he, Xu Qi’an? Release him immediately, and I shall pretend this never happened,” Minister Sun declared, looking past Xu Qi’an as though the man did not truly exist.

“What do you mean? I don’t understand,” Xu Qi’an replied, feigning innocence, then suddenly widened his eyes in mock horror. “Ah, so Minister Sun not only falsely accuses my cousin of exam fraud, but now wishes to implicate me as well. Unbelievable—I never knew that such a base and vile person existed in this world.”

“You…”

Minister Sun finally looked directly at Xu Qi’an, dismissing the other attendants from the hall. Then, he leaned forward, speaking deliberately, “I’m giving you a chance. If you intend to remain in government in the capital, release my son at once.”

Xu Qi’an shook his head. “Minister Sun, you must be mistaken. This official truly has no idea what you’re talking about.”

Pausing as though he’d had a sudden realisation, he put on a look of concern. “Are you saying that Young Master Sun has gone missing? Has he been kidnapped? You should’ve informed me right away—I’m always willing to act in the public’s interest, and no one matches my skill at solving cases. If Minister Sun asks, I promise to find him within a day.”

*Playing dumb with me…* Minister Sun felt his rage mounting and spat, “Xu Qi’an, do not forget you have family too.”

Xu Qi’an sighed, his expression darkening. “It appears you misunderstand me, Minister Sun. I lost both parents in my youth, and my uncle raised me.”

“Yet, my aunt mistreated me, insulted and humiliated me, eventually driving me out at fifteen to live in a kennel. Unfortunately, unlike some, I do not have a father leading an army of a hundred thousand, nor a father with a wry mouth….”

“Xu Qi’an!” Minister Sun cut him off, glaring at him for a long moment before speaking in a low voice.

“What do you truly want? The exam fraud case is a matter ordered by His Majesty himself, overseen by the Ministry of Law and the Magistrate’s Office, with all eyes upon it. If you think you can use my son to manipulate me, then you’re a fool. I will not compromise.”

*In this world, the one with greater resolve wins…* Xu Qi’an thought, knowing that a cousin was never as vital as one’s own child. He could be ruthless, but Minister Sun would never have that luxury. Narrowing his eyes, he moved closer to Minister Sun and spoke in a low tone.

“I have only one request. During Xu Xinnian’s imprisonment, he is not to be tortured, nor coerced into a confession. If he loses a single finger, I will take one from your son. For every wound on him, I will mark your son the same way.

“When the investigation ends—whether or not Xu Xinnian is found innocent—I will release your son.”

“Xu Qi’an…”

Minister Sun started to rebuke him, but Xu Qi’an’s face turned menacing, his voice harsh. “Address me properly—as Viscount.”

Reluctantly, Minister Sun softened his tone. “Viscount, why should I believe you?”

Xu Qi’an casually picked up a pastry from the table and took a bite. “Do you have any other option, Minister Sun? Whether you trust me or not, you’ll still do as I ask. Unless, of course, you no longer care about your own son’s life. I’m not asking you to help Xu Xinnian escape judgment, only to refrain from further intervention. That’s all.”

He walked in front of the minister, and brushed crumbs off his fingers onto his crimson robe, saying in a cold voice, “Just as you said, I have family, too.”

This tactic, inspired by Wei Yuan, was Xu Qi’an’s own invention. Wei Yuan had offered no suggestions. Doing nothing and hoping the opposition would show mercy was naive, and Xu Qi’an’s earlier humiliation at the Ministry of Law was proof enough of that.

To bring down an enemy, one must target their weaknesses, and for most people, family was that weak point. Nonetheless, implicating family was taboo, and knowing where to draw the line was critical. Thus, he didn’t naively believe a single hostage could guarantee Xu Xinnian’s release. It was merely a bargaining chip to prevent Minister Sun from taking further action, reducing the stakes and easing the overall nature of the transaction.

Minister Sun took a deep breath. “Very well. I won’t have Xu Xinnian tortured, but my son better return unscathed, or there will be consequences.”

“Naturally,” Xu Qi’an scoffed.

“However, I need assurance as well. I want to see Xu Xinnian. Make the arrangements.”

With that, he strode toward the door, suddenly turning back with a smirk. “And, by the way… “Viscount”? It has a nice ring to it, you said it well.”

Minister Sun’s face darkened, his beard trembling in fury.

…

Clink, clink…

The sound of chains sliding echoed as the jailer unlocked the heavy door to the dungeon, where a damp, decaying odor filled the air.

Following the jailer through a dim passageway, Xu Qi’an reached the cell where Xu Xinnian was held.

Xu Xinnian sat with his eyes closed, leaning against the wall to rest, dressed in prison garb, his face pale and covered in bloodstains.

Seeing his cousin’s wretched state, Xu Qi’an’s face turned dark—he had arrived too late; Xinnian had clearly suffered in the cell.

He murmured gently, “Erlang… Erlang…”

Xu Xinnian blinked, surprised, as he opened his eyes in disbelief.
