# 385. I'm Home

The Imperial Palace, the Imperial Garden.

Inside a pavilion draped with pale yellow curtains, around an octagonal table of huanghua pear wood, were sat a man in a yellow robe and another in azure.

Wei Yuan and Emperor Yuanjing were of a similar age—one with a ruddy complexion and a head full of black hair, the other already greying at the temples, his eyes carrying the weight of years.

If men were like wine, Emperor Yuanjing would be the most dazzling, the most esteemed vessel, yet in terms of flavour, Wei Yuan was the richest and most fragrant.

The two were engaged in a game of Go.

Watching as Wei Yuan captured his white piece, Emperor Yuanjing sighed,

"Since King Huai's death, the Northern Border has lost its pillar of support. The barbarians won’t be able to stir up trouble for a while either, but if the Church of the Warlock God in the Northeast bypasses the border and enters through Chuzhou, they would be marching straight for the capital—a dragon slayer at our gates!"

As he spoke, Emperor Yuanjing placed a piece down. The crisp click of the stone on the board shifted the game’s momentum—his white pieces forming a sharp blade, pressing straight for the “great dragon”.

"Ah, Lord Wei, you seem a little absent-minded in today’s game."

Wei Yuan’s gaze remained gentle. He pinched a black piece between his fingers and said,

"A pillar too tall and mighty is difficult to control. When it collapses, it injures others as well as oneself."

He placed the piece lightly.

As they continued their game, speaking idly between moves, Emperor Yuanjing suddenly remarked,

"A few days ago, there was an assassination attempt on the Crown Prince, and the Inner Palace is in turmoil. Even the Empress was frightened and has since lost sleep and appetite—she looks haggard. Lord Wei, capture the assassin quickly and put an end to this, so the Empress need not live in fear."

Wei Yuan glanced at the board, then conceded defeat, exhaling slowly.

"Your Majesty's skill in Go grows ever more refined."

Then, rising to his feet, he took a step back and bowed,

"It is your servant’s failing. Your lowly servant will devote his utmost effort to capturing the assassin by morning."

Emperor Yuanjing burst into laughter.

…

At the same time, in the Cabinet.

A middle-aged eunuch in a python robe entered the Wenyuan Pavilion, accompanied by two other eunuchs, to pay respects to Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen.

They did not stay long—only a quarter of an hour—before the grand eunuch led his attendants away.

Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen sat motionless behind his desk, his expression unreadable, like a silent statue.

…

The next day, at court.

Emperor Yuanjing continued his dispute with the officials over the Chuzhou case, but it lacked the intensity of the previous day. The hall no longer crackled with tension.

Though the court session again ended without resolution, it dispersed in a more measured tone.

Zheng Xinghuai, a veteran of the bureaucracy, sensed unease in the air—his fears from the previous day had finally come to pass.

Though the officials still refused to yield, they no longer adamantly demanded Zhenbei King’s punishment.

Even more telling, when the nobility proposed ways to quell the rumours in the capital and shift the perception of Chuzhou’s twenty thousand soldiers, some civil officials, under the guise of rebuke, had joined the discussion.

What pained Zheng Xinghuai most, however, was that Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen remained silent throughout.

Leaving court, Zheng Xinghuai walked in silence, lost in thought, until a voice called from behind,

"Lord Zheng, please wait."

He turned mechanically, seeing Duke Cao approaching with a clear smile on his face.

To Zheng Xinghuai, it was the smile of a victor.

"Lord Zheng, you left Chuzhou without permission, entered the capital to file your complaint, thinking you had the momentum of righteousness. Did you ever consider you would face such a day?"

Duke Cao’s expression remained composed as he said lightly,

"I offer you a straightforward path. Chuzhou lies in ruins and needs rebuilding. As its Provincial Administrator, that is where you belong.

"As for matters in the capital, best to keep yourself uninvolved."

He glanced back towards the Jinluan Hall and added,

"This is also His Majesty’s will."

His Majesty’s will was clear—if Zheng Xinghuai withdrew now, he would remain Chuzhou’s Provincial Administrator. He could return to where he came from. The capital was thousands of li away; out of sight, out of mind.

"Bah!"

What met his offer was Zheng Xinghuai’s spittle.

"Unappreciative."

Duke Cao watched his retreating figure and let out a cold laugh.

…

Nightwatcher Constabulary, Tower of Noble Spirit.

The first person Zheng Xinghuai visited after court was Wei Yuan.

Xu Qi’an had been following the court developments closely. He had intended to seek Zheng Xinghuai at the post station for information, but upon hearing of his visit to Wei Yuan, he rushed to the Tower of Noble Spirit—only to be stopped at the entrance.

"Duke Wei said that while he has guests, no one is to disturb him. Also, Duke Wei has no plans to see you these days. He’s turned you away several times now, hasn’t he?"

The guard was an old acquaintance, and didn’t hold his words.

Xu Qi’an, equally unrestrained, rained slaps upon his head, scolding,

"Talking too much, are you? Talking too much…"

On the seventh floor.

Dressed in azure robes, his temples touched with grey, Wei Yuan sat cross-legged before a desk.

Opposite him sat Zheng Xinghuai, his once-straight back beginning to stoop, his hair just as grey, his brow furrowed with deep-seated frustration.

"When the official evaluation ended, and you returned to report, this official met with you once," Wei Yuan said gently, his gaze filled with quiet sympathy.

"At the time, though your hair was greying, your spirit was still strong."

But now, he seemed hollow, as if his soul had been drained. Heavy bags under his eyes and bloodshot sclera spoke of sleepless nights.

The downturn of his lips and the tension in his brow showed his heart remained heavy with resentment—an injustice unaddressed, a fury unspent.

"Has Duke Wei also decided to give up?" Zheng Xinghuai asked gravely.

"I admire Xu Qi’an, I believe him to be a born warrior," Wei Yuan replied instead.

"But at times, his temperament gives me headaches.

"I told him: navigating the bureaucracy requires three considerations—consider risk, consider retreat, consider change.

"Before acting, weigh the consequences. Understand the stakes. Then decide whether to proceed.

"When faced with an unstoppable tide, one must consider retreat—to avoid its force. His Majesty excels in this. Only when you have withdrawn safely can you then plan how to shift the tides.

"That brat Xu Qi’an answered me: ‘I understand all this, but I don’t care.’

"Hah. A crude martial man."

Zheng Xinghuai recalled Xu Qi’an’s words in the cavern.

Despite knowing Zhenbei King’s overwhelming power, he still went to Chuzhou to investigate.

The rigid lines of Zheng Xinghuai’s face softened slightly with a smile.

"For Duke Wei to call someone ‘crude’—it seems even you are helpless against him."

He understood Wei Yuan’s unspoken message.

But like Xu Qi’an, he had his own principles—lines he would never cross, nor retreat from.

He descended alone, spotting Xu Qi’an waiting below.

"Sir Zheng, let me escort you back to the courier station." Xu Qi’an stepped forward to meet him.

"I am not returning to the courier station." Zheng Xinghuai shook his head, looking at him with a complex expression. "Apologies for disappointing you, Silver Gong Xu."

Xu Qi’an’s heart sank.

The two men left the constabulary in silence, boarded the carriage, and Shentu Baili took the reins, driving them away.

On the way, Zheng Xinghuai recounted the events of the court session that day, pointing out the ambiguous stance of the officials and how their positions were quietly shifting.

"Duke Wei shouldn’t be like this. At his level, if he truly desires something, he can scheme for it himself. There’s no need for him to betray his conscience and pander to His Majesty."

Xu Qi’an frowned deeply, unable to understand.

"Duke Wei is constrained." Zheng Xinghuai explained helplessly, "There is a fundamental divide between ruler and subject. As long as His Majesty does not threaten the interests of the majority, there is no one in court who can oppose him."

"Sir Zheng, have you considered Duke Wei’s advice to think thrice? Why not lie low for now? King Huai is dead, the people of Chuzhou have had their vengeance." Xu Qi’an urged.

Zheng Xinghuai was a good official. Xu Qi’an did not wish to see such a man meet a tragic end, just as he had once stood alone against the rebel army in Yunzhou for Inspector Zhang.

But this time, there was no rebel army. This time, the battlefield was the imperial court, and Xu Qi’an could not simply draw his blade and slaughter his way into the palace.

All he could do was persuade Lord Zheng to reconsider.

Zheng Xinghuai looked at him and asked, "Can you accept this? Can you accept that a butcher like King Huai will be honoured as a hero, enshrined in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, and remembered throughout history?"

Xu Qi’an did not answer, but Zheng Xinghuai saw the refusal in his eyes.

Satisfied, he smiled.

"This official is a Rank Two Provincial Administrator, but more importantly, this official is a scholar. Scholars seek to live with a clear conscience—not only for themselves, but also for the parents who raised them with great effort."

Silence filled the carriage.

After a long while, it came to a halt by the roadside. Shentu Baili spoke in a low voice, "Sir, we’ve arrived."

Xu Qi’an lifted the curtain and saw that the carriage had stopped in front of a grand estate. Above the entrance hung a plaque bearing the words: Wenyuan Pavilion.

The Cabinet!

Zheng Xinghuai alighted and said to the guards at the gate, "I am Zheng Xinghuai, Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou. I seek an audience with Prime Minister Wang."

Xu Qi’an immediately understood Zheng Xinghuai’s intentions—he wished to act as a lobbyist, persuading the officials to return to their original stance.

A guard went inside to report, and soon returned with a solemn expression.

"His Excellency, the Prime Minister, says that Sir Zheng is the Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou. Whether on duty or off duty, he must not seek him out, lest he be impeached for factionalism."

Zheng Xinghuai left, disappointed.

For the rest of the day, Xu Qi’an watched as he tirelessly sought out officials, only to be turned away at every turn.

By dusk, he returned to the courier station in despondence.

—

Xu Xinnian returned home after his duties, but his elder brother was nowhere to be seen. After searching the courtyard, he finally heard a voice from the rooftop.

"Your elder brother is here."

It was the clear, melodic voice of a young woman.

Looking up, he saw that it was the Holy Maiden of the Heavenly Sect, Li Miaozhen. She stood on the eaves, looking down at him with an impassive expression. From her face alone, one could tell she was in a foul mood.

By the time Xu Erlang fetched a ladder, Li Miaozhen had already vanished. His elder brother lay on the rooftop, chewing on a blade of grass, hands behind his head, one leg crossed over the other.

The strikingly handsome Xu Xinnian gathered his robe and climbed up.

"What are you doing up here?" Xu Qi’an said irritably. "One nagging woman just left, and now you’re here to bother me."

"Daoist Li didn’t seem pleased," Xu Erlang observed calmly, sitting beside him.

"Of course not. If she were strong enough, she’d storm the palace at six and kill them all."

"Why wait until six?"

"Because she thinks the court is full of beasts who deserve to die. She wants to wait until morning court and slaughter them all at once."

Xu Erlang shrank his head. "Good thing I’m only a Scholar-in-Waiting."

Xu Qi’an couldn’t help but laugh. Then, after a moment, he sighed.

"The Heavenly Sect cultivates detachment from worldly emotions. Perhaps one day, when she truly has the power, she will no longer be the Lady Flying Swallow we know. Such is life—nine times out of ten, it is filled with disappointment."

"Big Brother seems much calmer now," Xu Erlang remarked with relief.

"It’s not calmness. Just exhaustion. Disillusionment." Xu Qi’an gazed at the darkening sky, murmuring, "Is it really so difficult to admit a mistake and apologise?"

Xu Erlang turned his head to glance at him before looking up at the dark heavens.

"I understand the situation in court now, and I wanted to discuss it with you. The case of Zhenbei King’s massacre—though the court has yet to make an official ruling, the capital is in an uproar. The outcome is already decided.

"Reversing it won’t be easy.

"Even if the court forces the narrative that Zhenbei King is a hero, the massacre will remain etched in people’s memories. That initial shock will never fade. This will be the key to overturning the verdict in the future."

*Overturn the verdict…* Xu Qi’an’s brows shot up as countless historical cases from his past life flashed through his mind.

Many loyal officials had been wrongly executed, only to be vindicated years later. Many traitors who once basked in glory had eventually met their rightful end.

The most infamous among them was Qin Hui.

Even today, his bronze statue, kneeling beside his wife’s, remained in a certain famous scenic spot, condemned by later generations.

Condemned so thoroughly that even his wife’s stone chest shone from all the spitting.[^1]

*Was this Duke Wei’s intention when he advised Zheng Xinghuai to think thrice?… Sir Zheng is too consumed by rage and grief to see reason. Perhaps he cannot understand Duke Wei’s meaning. I should remind him tomorrow.*

*A gentleman’s revenge is never too late. If the tide is against us, we should endure.*

*My brother truly has the makings of a Prime Minister—his wisdom rivals even Duke Wei’s…*

Xu Qi’an sat up with relief and slung an arm around Xu Erlang’s shoulders.

Xu Erlang shoved him away in disgust.

—

The Imperial Palace.

In the opulent sleeping quarters, Emperor Yuanjing reclined on a couch, studying the Daoist Canon. Without looking up, he asked, "What news from the Cabinet?"

The old eunuch replied softly, "The Prime Minister has not been receiving guests."

Emperor Yuanjing nodded in satisfaction. "And Wei Yuan?"

"After court two days ago, Minister Zheng visited the Nightwatchers' constabulary. Duke Wei received him, but they had no further contact afterwards."

Emperor Yuanjing turned a page and pondered for a moment. Then, his expression suddenly darkened.

"And Zheng Xinghuai?"

"For the past few days, Sir Zheng has been lobbying officials, but few are willing to meet him. The court is still watching and waiting. So, he changed tactics—he has gone to the Imperial Academy to incite the scholars."

Emperor Yuanjing smiled, but his gaze had no trace of a smile, rather it was cold as ice.

…

Morning, 12th of May, eight days had passed since Zhenbei King’s corpse was transported back to the capital.

The imperial court had yet to issue an official announcement on his sentencing.

The citizens of the capital, however, were in no hurry. As those who lived under the Son of Heaven’s rule, they had seen cases drag on for years and tax relief decrees that had supposedly been in circulation for years yet would likely continue to be circulated indefinitely.

Though they were not impatient, the matter remained a topic of discussion, its fervour undiminished.

Over tea and meals, the people of the capital would habitually bring up Zhenbei King, rehashing the matter again and again…

That morning, a group of unexpected visitors arrived in the capital.

Thirty riders galloped through the city gates, past the outer city, and came to a stop at the entrance to the inner city.

Leading them was a man with a striking face, marred by the loss of one eye—Que Yongxiu, the Commander of Chuzhou.

The Duke Protector was clad in battered armour, his hair dishevelled, his entire person exuding the weariness of a long journey.

His companions were in similar states.

Upon reaching the city gates, Que Yongxiu dismounted and entered the city on foot. Taking a blood-stained document from his robes, he held it aloft and shouted:

“This duke is Que Yongxiu, Commander of Chuzhou and Duke Protector. I accuse the Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou, Zheng Xinghuai, of colluding with the Yao and Barbarians, causing the death of Zhenbei King and the massacre of 380,000 citizens of Chuzhou City.

“Afterwards, Zheng Xinghuai deceived the diplomatic mission and pursued me to cover up his collusion, framing Zhenbei King for the slaughter. His crimes are beyond measure!”

He walked as he spoke, drawing the attention of the citizens, who stopped to watch and discuss.

“The Duke Protector? The one from Chuzhou? Wasn’t he the one who aided and abetted Zhenbei King in the massacre?”

“It’s good he’s back—walking straight into his own doom. Keep an eye on them; don’t let them escape. Let’s go report this to the constabulary.”

“Hold on, listen to what he’s saying! The Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou colluded with the Yao and Barbarians, got Zhenbei King killed, deceived the diplomatic mission… What in the world is going on?”

“Could it be that the Provincial Administrator was the true culprit behind the destruction of Chuzhou City?”

The common folk had heard such twists in cases before, much like the tales spun by storytellers—loyal officials wrongfully accused, only to be vindicated in the end.

They were all too familiar with such plots.

“It’s definitely a lie! It was Zhenbei King who massacred Chuzhou City! Have you all forgotten? Silver Gong Xu was part of the diplomatic mission. Would he falsely accuse an innocent man? If this Provincial Administrator were a traitor, would Sir Xu not have seen through it?”

“That makes sense.”

The surrounding citizens nodded in agreement.

During the year of official evaluation, the city had seen a series of major cases, and each time, the presiding investigator had been Xu Qi’an. Back then, he had risen from an unknown Bronze Gong to someone known by all, a frequent topic of conversation.

Upon returning from Yunzhou, his reputation soared further, elevating him from a mere talking point to a martyr. His true rise to prominence came with his battle against the Buddhist sects. Defeating them made him a hero of the capital, and as court bulletins spread across the land, he became a legend among commoners and martial artists alike, solidifying immense prestige.

The Conflict of Heaven and Man further cemented his reputation. His name was etched into the hearts and minds of the people—spoken in dreams, whispered in prayers, and shouted in the streets.

Thus, when compared to Que Yongxiu’s blood-stained document, the people were far more inclined to trust the Provincial Administrator of Chuzhou, whom Silver Gong Xu had brought back.

Before long, news of Que Yongxiu’s return, bearing a blood petition and publicly accusing Zheng Xinghuai, spread rapidly throughout the city.

The case of Zhenbei King’s massacre of Chuzhou City grew even murkier.

…

Following these events, Que Yongxiu was immediately taken to the palace by the Imperial Guards for a private audience with the Emperor.

Shortly after, the Emperor summoned the court officials for a small court in the Imperial Study.

Emperor Yuanjing sat behind his desk, with civil officials to his left and military nobles to his right. Before him, Que Yongxiu knelt, clutching the blood petition in his hands.

“My Lords, have a look at this document,” Emperor Yuanjing commanded, passing it to the old eunuch beside him.

The eunuch respectfully accepted it and handed it to the royal relatives before passing it to the civil officials.

Duke Cao strode forward angrily. “Your Majesty, Zheng Xinghuai colluded with the Yao and Barbarians, leading to Zhenbei King’s death. His crimes are heinous—he must face nine familial exterminations!”

The Assistant Minister of Rites frowned and stepped forth. “That is a hasty conclusion. If Zheng Xinghuai truly colluded with the Yao and Barbarians, why would his entire family be massacred?”

A prince countered, “And who can confirm that Zheng Xinghuai’s entire family perished in Chuzhou?”

Grand Scholar Zhao Tingfang of the Eastern Pavilion erupted in fury. “If Zheng Xinghuai conspired with the Yao and Barbarians, then what of the mysterious expert who slew Zhenbei King? He clearly named Zhenbei King as the butcher of Chuzhou. The diplomatic mission saw it with their own eyes and heard it with their own ears.”

The Duke of Cao sneered. “And who is this so-called expert? Have him come forward and testify for Zheng Xinghuai! Are we to trust the words of an unknown heretic?”

Imperial Censor Liu Hong retorted, “That so-called heretic was the one who slew the Barbarian chieftain! Duke Cao bows and scrapes before the Barbarians but acts all high and mighty in court. Truly impressive.”

Before the Duke could rebut, Left Censor-in-Chief Yuan Xiong interjected, arguing, “Not of our race, not of our hearts, Lord Liu. Do not forget your station.”

Liu Hong sneered. “Not of our race, yet can wield the Sovereign Sword?”

“Enough!”

Emperor Yuanjing suddenly slammed the table, his gaze sharp with anger.

Que Yongxiu immediately prostrated himself. “Your Majesty, I beg you to uphold justice for me, for Zhenbei King, for the people of Chuzhou City.”

The Emperor slowly nodded. “This case is of utmost importance. We shall ensure a thorough investigation. The Three Judicial Offices shall oversee this matter jointly. Duke Cao, you will participate as well.”

Then, he turned to the grand eunuch at his side. “Bestow a gold token upon the Duke Cao. He is to arrest Zheng Xinghuai at the courier station immediately. Anyone who obstructs this order shall be executed first and reported later.”

The Duke of Cao exulted. “As Your Majesty commands.”

… 

Leaving the palace, Wei Yuan swiftly caught up to Prime Minister Wang. The two towering figures of the court walked side by side, eschewing carriages.

This scene—these two men walking together—would become a sight to remember. Even years later, it would remain a moment worth reflecting upon.

“I warned Zheng Xinghuai,” Wei Yuan said, his tone gentle, his expression as calm as ever. “But he was too stubborn.”

“If he weren’t stubborn, he wouldn’t have been exiled to the northern frontier by the last Prime Minister,” Wang sneered. “What a fool.”

It was unclear whether he was cursing Zheng Xinghuai or himself.

Wei Yuan said indifferently, “We nearly caught Que Yongxiu in the palace last time, but he escaped. The next day, we scoured the entire city and still couldn’t find him. That was when I knew this was beyond our control.”

Wang remained impassive. “It’s not necessarily a bad thing. The ministers accepted His Majesty’s decree because the Zhenbei King is dead. But now that Que Yongxiu has returned alive, some of them will oppose it. That is our opportunity.”

Wei Yuan shook his head. “It is precisely because Que Yongxiu has returned that those people see a chance to ‘overturn the case.’ As long as they align with His Majesty, the verdict will be sealed. Once it is, Que Yongxiu, a Duke of First Rank and a descendant of the founding lords, will be near untouchable.”

After a brief silence, both men simultaneously asked, “Did he threaten you as well?”

…

The Courier Station.

Coughing came from within the room. Zheng Xinghuai, dressed in a plain blue robe, sat at the table, his right hand resting flat upon its surface.

A white-robed arcanist was taking his pulse.

After a long while, the white-robed arcanist withdrew his hand and shook his head.

"Accumulated stress has developed into illness. It’s nothing serious, though—take a few doses of medicine and rest for a few days, and you’ll recover. But, Sir Zheng, you’d best learn to let things go sooner rather than later, or this illness will return."

Chen Xian and his wife let out a sigh of relief, only to sigh once more.

The illness of the body was a minor one, not difficult to cure. What was difficult was the illness in Sir Zheng’s heart.

Zheng Xinghuai did not respond to the white-robed arcanist’s prognosis. Instead, he cupped his hands in thanks. "Many thanks, doctor."

"Don’t act like it’s nothing." The white-robed arcanists of the Sitianjian were proud by nature—so long as they weren’t under threat of violence, they always spoke their minds.

"You’re not that old yet. If you can learn to be thick-skinned, you might live a few more years. Otherwise, within three to five years, you’ll be bedridden with a serious illness, and within ten, I’ll be offering incense at your grave."

Chen Xian and his wife looked displeased.

Zheng Xinghuai, however, seemed accustomed to the bluntness of the white-robed arcanists. Rather than taking offence, he asked, "I hear that Silver Gong Xu and the Sitianjian are on very close terms."

The white-robed arcanist let out a derisive chuckle. "I know what you’re thinking. Young Master Xu is indeed a valued guest of our Sitianjian. However, if you’re hoping to use him to meet the Jianzheng, forget it. The Sitianjian does not interfere in court affairs. That is our rule."

Zheng Xinghuai was about to speak when the white-robed arcanist added, "Silver Gong Xu has already pleaded with the Sitianjian on your behalf. If this path could work, do you think it would still be up to you to ask?"

*He… He’s already been to the Sitianjian…* A complex look crossed Zheng Xinghuai’s face. Among the envoy returning to the capital, only Silver Gong Xu continued to work tirelessly for this cause.

The others, constrained by circumstances, had all chosen silence.

Just then, urgent footsteps sounded from downstairs, followed by Zhao Jin’s furious roar. "Which constabulary do you lot belong to, daring to trespass into the post station where Sir Zheng resides—"

Zheng Xinghuai and the others rushed out of the room, only to witness Duke Cao, clad in military armour, swinging his sheathed blade and striking Zhao Jin across the face, shattering half of his teeth.

The Nightwatcher Silver Gong, leading a few Bronze Gongs, stepped forward, shouting, "Halt!"

Ordering the Bronze Gongs to restrain the enraged Zhao Jin, the Silver Gong glared a warning. "These are the imperial guards."

Zhao Jin’s face stiffened.

The Silver Gong took a deep breath, cupped his hands, and asked, "Duke Cao, what is the meaning of this?"

Duke Cao’s gaze landed upon Zheng Xinghuai, who had just emerged from his room. His smile was cold and sinister. "By His Majesty’s decree, Zheng Xinghuai is to be taken to the High Court for questioning. Any who resist shall be executed without mercy."

"What?!"

The faces of the Nightwatchers and Zhao Jin’s men changed drastically.

Zheng Xinghuai, unshaken and with a clear conscience, asked, "What crime have I committed?"

Duke Cao hesitated for a moment before his smile turned playful, laced with mockery. "It seems Sir Zheng has not stepped outside today. Well then, Chuzhou’s Commander-in-Chief and Duke Protector Que Yongxiu has returned to the capital. He has accused you before His Majesty of colluding with the yao monsters and barbarians, causing the deaths of Zhenbei King and the 380,000 people of Chuzhou City."

Zheng Xinghuai stumbled, his face draining of all colour.

……….

Huaiqing Manor.

The captain of the guards knocked on the study door of Princess Huaiqing, stepped inside, and presented a slip of paper.

"Your Highness, the intelligence you requested is all here. Sir Zheng has already been imprisoned. Moreover, many in the capital are spreading rumours that 'Sir Zheng is the true traitor who colluded with the yao and barbarians.' It is Duke Cao’s men orchestrating it from behind the scenes…"

Huaiqing listened as she unfolded the slip of paper and silently read through it.

*I knew it. Father had another move prepared. Que Yongxiu had long returned to the capital, lying in wait for the opportune moment. Father ignored the rumours in the capital precisely to await this moment… How formidable.*

She waved her hand.

The captain withdrew.

Once the study door closed, Huaiqing, dressed in a plain white gown, walked to the window and gazed silently at the spring scenery outside.

A soft sigh echoed through the study.

……….

Eastern Palace.

Lifting the hem of her skirt, Lin’an dashed forward like a flickering flame, her skirt, jade sash, and silk ribbons fluttering.

Six palace maids chased after her, shouting, "Your Highness, slow down! Your Highness, slow down!"

"Royal Brother! Royal Brother!"

Her crisp, bell-like voice rang out, drifting into the hall.

The Crown Prince was in his bedchamber, enjoying the company of a charming palace maid. Upon hearing his sister’s voice, his face changed dramatically. He scrambled off the bed, hurriedly picked up his clothes from the floor, and dressed as quickly as possible.

Fortunately, the eunuchs of the Eastern Palace were tactful and knew their master was busy with the important duty of producing heirs for the royal family. They blocked Lin’an from entering the bedchamber and ushered her into the reception hall.

As the Crown Prince straightened his attire, he entered the reception hall. Upon seeing his younger sister, his expression softened. "What has you in such a hurry?"

Lin’an furrowed her delicate brows, her charming peach-blossom eyes filled with anxiety and worry. "Royal Brother, I heard that Administrator Zheng has been arrested by Father."

The Crown Prince paused for a moment before nodding. "I know."

Having been Crown Prince for so many years, he naturally had a clear grasp of court affairs.

Lin’an, looking furtive, whispered, "Father… He wants to kill Sir Zheng, doesn’t he?"

The Crown Prince dismissed the eunuchs and palace maids. Once only the siblings remained in the hall, he nodded, confirming her suspicion.

Lin’an’s lively peach-blossom eyes dimmed. In a low voice, she asked, "King Huai massacred an entire city, slaughtering 380,000 innocent people. Why does Father still cover for him, even going so far as to frame Sir Zheng?"

*This concerned the dignity of the royal family—there could be no compromise…* The Crown Prince had intended to say so, but seeing his sister’s downcast expression, he sighed and patted her shoulder.

"You are but a young lady. Don’t concern yourself with these matters. Why not learn from Huaiqing? You shouldn’t have returned to the palace."

Lin’an lowered her head like a disheartened little girl.

The Crown Prince, still fond of his sister, pressed her shoulders and said in a solemn tone, "Father favours you because you are sweet-tongued and never meddle in court affairs. Why have you changed?"

Lin’an muttered, "Because Xu Qi’an keeps rising in rank…"

The Crown Prince’s face darkened in anger. "Did he encourage you to return to the palace?"

"No…" Lin’an pouted in grievance. "I… I don’t dare face him. I have no right to see him."

King Huai was her uncle. Having committed such atrocities in Chuzhou, how could she entirely dissociate herself?

Guilt over the 380,000 wronged souls made her feel unworthy of seeing Xu Qi’an.

She even thought despairingly that it might be better never to see him again.

"So you came to me today to plead with Father on Sir Zheng’s behalf?" The Crown Prince led her back to her seat. Seeing his sister nod timidly, he shook his head with a wry smile.

"Father refuses even to see you. Why would he heed me? Lin’an, there is no right or wrong in court affairs—only interests. Even if I were to intervene, would it matter? I am the Crown Prince. I must stand with the imperial clan and the nobility.

"You are but a young lady. No one cares what you do. Were you a prince, your recent actions would have cost you the throne."

Lin’an looked heartbroken. "But… for taking so many lives, there must be consequences. Otherwise, who will believe in our Great Feng’s laws? Huaiqing told me that the one who slaughtered for King Huai was the Duke Protector.

"He slaughtered so many people, yet Father still protects him. It makes me so unhappy."

*Foolish sister. Beneath Father’s dragon throne lies a mountain of corpses.*

*These things happened before, happen now, and will continue to happen.*

*No one can change that.*

*Not even Xu Qi’an, whom you admire so much.*

The Crown Prince shook his head helplessly.

…

High Court, prison.

Early summer, the air in the prison was rancid, filled with the stench of unrestrained bodily waste and the rotting odour of leftover food.

The oppressive, foul air was enough to make one retch.

The High Court Deputy Justice entered the prison carrying two jugs of wine and a parcel of beef. He walked unhurriedly to the cell where Zheng Xinghuai was held, not minding the filth of the place, and sat down heavily.

"Sir Zheng, I’ve come to drink with you," the High Court Deputy Justice said with a smile.

Zheng Xinghuai, shackled hand and foot, approached the bars and scrutinised him. "You don’t look well."

"Nonsense, I look perfectly fine—healthy and at ease."

The High Court Deputy Justice unwrapped the oiled paper and shared the beef with Zheng Xinghuai. As they ate, he suddenly said, "Once this is over, I will retire and return home."

Zheng Xinghuai glanced at him and nodded. "That’s good."

After finishing the meat and wine, the High Court Deputy Justice got up, bowed deeply to Zheng Xinghuai, and said, "Thank you, Sir Zheng."

He gave no explanation and left without another word.

*Thank you for helping me find my conscience again.*

Just as he stepped out of the underground prison, the High Court Deputy Justice saw a group of people approaching. At the forefront were Duke Cao and Duke Protector Que Yongxiu.

*What were they doing here? Was Duke Protector, as a key figure in the case, also going to be detained?*

His gaze swept past them to the attendants following behind… *Bringing attendants while being taken into custody?*

"Deputy Justice, we meet again," Que Yongxiu greeted with a smirk, looking him up and down before clicking his tongue.

"So you’re only a Rank Six official. Back in Chuzhou, I thought you were at least Rank One, given how imposing you were—daring even to question me."

Suppressing his anger, the High Court Deputy Justice asked in a low voice, "What business do you have at the High Court?"

"Naturally, we’re here to interrogate a prisoner." Que Yongxiu sneered. "By order of His Majesty, we are to question Zheng Xinghuai. During this time, no one is allowed to enter the prison. Any violators will be treated as accomplices and punished accordingly."

With that, the two dukes stepped into the dungeon, and their attendants shut and locked the door behind them.

*They were going to silence him…* The thought struck the High Court Deputy Justice like a bolt of lightning.

Instinctively, he wanted to seek help from the Chief Justice, but the fact that the two dukes had dared to come here meant that the Chief Justice was already aware of the matter and had tacitly approved it.

Because these two nobles had the Emperor’s approval.

*They want to kill him to silence him and then frame it as a suicide from guilt, presenting it as fact to the public.*

*This is far easier than overturning the previous conclusion and forcing an exoneration for King Huai. It’s also more palatable to the people.*

*His Majesty… He never intended to conduct a trial at all. He wants to catch the minsters off guard and leave them with no choices….*

The High Court Deputy Justice strode away, his pace quickening until he was sprinting towards the stables of the Constabulary.

He had only one thought in mind: *find Xu Qi’an.*

*Only that stubborn, immovable bastard could stop Duke Protector and Duke Cao. Only he would fly into a rage for the sake of his beliefs.*

……….

Duke Cao pinched his nose, frowning as he walked through the dungeon’s passageways.

"What’s a little stench? You’ve been away from the battlefield too long, Duke Cao." scoffed the one-eyed Que Yongxiu.

"Enough nonsense. Let’s get this done quickly and leave before anything unexpected happens," Duke Cao said dismissively.

They stopped in front of Zheng Xinghuai’s cell. Que Yongxiu glanced at the jugs and oiled paper on the ground and chuckled. "Sir Zheng, you’re living quite comfortably."

Zheng Xinghuai’s eyes turned bloodshot in an instant. He dragged his shackles as he rushed to the bars, roaring like a lion, "Que Yongxiu, you beast!"

Que Yongxiu wasn’t angered. Instead, he smiled pleasantly. "Yes, I’m a beast—the beast who slaughtered your entire family. Zheng Xinghuai, you were lucky to escape that day, which led to all this trouble. Today, I’ve come to reunite you with them."

Zheng Xinghuai howled, his mind flooded with images of his grandson skewered on a spear, his son nailed to the ground, his wife and daughter-in-law hacked to death.

The people of Chuzhou collapsing under a rain of arrows, lives treated as nothing more than weeds.

Scene after scene played out, searingly vivid, making his soul tremble and wail.

Que Yongxiu laughed heartily, his body shaking with mirth.

Duke Cao, standing beside him, sneered. "You’ve been stirring things up these past few days. His Majesty has long since lost patience. If not for your remaining usefulness, you would’ve been silenced long ago. Zheng Xinghuai, you’re not nearly clever enough.

"If you had truly thought about everything that happened in Chuzhou, you’d know exactly who you were up against."

Zheng Xinghuai froze, as if struck by a heavy blow.

A few seconds later, the scholar’s body began to tremble—uncontrollably, ceaselessly.

"Why… Why would he do this? They… They were his people…."

He lowered his head, and never lifted it again.

The scholar’s spine had been broken.

Que Yongxiu snorted. "Thank Duke Cao. At least now you can die with some understanding."

He stretched out his hand, grinning viciously. "Bring me the silk sash. I want to personally send him off."

An attendant handed him the sash, while another opened the cell door.

Que Yongxiu strode in, flicked his wrist, and looped the silk around Zheng Xinghuai’s neck. Yanking it tight, he sneered:

"Zheng Xinghuai, Chuzhou’s Provincial Administrator, colluded with the Yao and the barbarians to massacre 380,000 citizens. After being exposed by Duke Protector Que Yongxiu, he hanged himself in prison out of guilt.

"Isn’t this an appropriate ending, Sir Zheng?"

Zheng Xinghuai could no longer speak. His eyes bulged, his face turned red, and his tongue slowly protruded.

His struggles weakened, his kicks became feeble—his life draining away like a candle flickering in the wind.

At the brink of death, his past flashed through his mind.

A childhood of hardship, an ambitious youth, a disappointed adulthood, a selfless middle age… At the very end of his life, it was as if he had returned to his childhood village.

He ran along the muddy road, heading home. It was a road he had walked countless times, yet today, for some reason, he felt an urgent need to hurry.

Bang, bang, bang!

He knocked anxiously on the courtyard door.

The door slowly opened, revealing an ordinary woman, weathered by time, her smile warm and gentle.

He let out a breath, as if he had found a safe harbour, and shed all his exhaustion. He smiled happily.

"Mum, I’m home…."

………

Who knows how long later, a sudden, thunderous crash shattered the silence of the dungeon.

The iron door leading to the underground prison was kicked open with tremendous force, slamming against the opposite wall. The deafening impact echoed through the passageways.

Xu Qi’an charged into the dungeon, blade in hand.

The High Court Deputy Justice, gasping for breath, struggled to keep up. At his age, even with careful maintenance of his health, the sprint had left his lungs burning.

He caught up just in time to see Xu Qi’an suddenly freeze at a certain cell door—motionless, like a statue.

A terrible feeling gripped the High Court Deputy Justice’s heart.

Summoning his remaining strength, he staggered forward.

Inside the dim cell, a body hung from the bars.

The High Court Deputy Justice collapsed onto the ground, covering his face, his tears streaming uncontrollably.
