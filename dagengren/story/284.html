# 284. Question and Answer

Hengyuan frowned, sensing something was amiss. Ever since he introduced himself, the expressions of the two gatekeeper monks had been strange. After delivering the message, there was an unspoken hostility.

"Please lead the way!" Hengyuan said humbly, lowering his eyes.

Under the lead of the monks at the gate, they passed through the front courtyard and main building, arriving at the rear courtyard.

Under the eaves, standing in the corridor, was a middle-aged monk. He wore the rough attire of a wandering monk, his face was round, and his earlobes thick. He looked expressionless as he scrutinised Hengyuan.

"Are you Hengyuan from Qinglong Temple?" Monk Jingchen's sharp gaze examined Hengyuan.

"Yes, that is this poor monk," Hengyuan responded.

Hengyuan was also observing Jingchen. By this point, he had already realised that the group of monks from the Western Region held some undefined hostility toward him.

Hengyuan had no idea where this hostility came from, as they had never had any contact before.

"A monk does not lie!" Monk Jingchen said sternly.

Upon hearing these words, Hengyuan's immediate instinct was a warning bell ringing in his ears. He couldn't lie and had to answer honestly.

"Yes, that is me." Hengyuan clasped his hands together and replied calmly.

Monk Jingchen fell silent. He had just used the power of the Silacarya, confirming that this monk who claimed to be Hengyuan wasn't lying. Unless the other party was also a Silacarya who could alter monastic precepts himself, he couldn't have lied.

The question now was, if this person was indeed Hengyuan, who was the other monk earlier?

What was their purpose?

Jingchen carefully reviewed the conversation, suddenly realising with alarm that the earlier monk had come for the sealed object at Sangpo.

If that was the case, the nature of this matter was far more serious than simply someone impersonating Hengyuan. It involved the demon monk, and he needed to handle this with great caution.

"The monk earlier also knew the Buddhist Lion's Roar. Even if he isn't Hengyuan, he must be a Buddhist... But even if this one before me is truly Hengyuan, is he really here just for a visit with no other intentions?"

With these thoughts flashing through his mind, Monk Jingchen made a decisive move. Pointing at Hengyuan, he shouted, "Seize him!"

Immediately, two monks dressed in azure *kasaya* robes stepped forward, pressing down on Hengyuan's shoulders.

Bang!

Hengyuan's Qi surged, easily sending the two monks flying.

In the corridor, Monk Jingchen clasped his hands together in a seal, chanting, "The body cannot move, the hands cannot shift, the mouth cannot speak."

As his voice fell, golden ripples, gentle yet firm, spread from his hand seal and swept over Hengyuan.

In an instant, Hengyuan seemed trapped in a mire. Though his mind remained sharp, his body had completely lost its ability to move.

_Boom, boom, boom..._

Around Hengyuan, waves of air erupted, like tiny explosions of fireworks. He was trying to resist the precepts with brute force, attempting to break free from the trap.

Jingchen frowned, realising that this monk claiming to be Hengyuan was far stronger than he had anticipated. He shouted urgently, "Capture him now!"

More monks rushed out of the rooms, including warrior monks, dharmacarya, and dhyanacarya. The latter two had limited combat abilities, leaving it to the warrior monks to handle the physical confrontation.

However, before they could encircle him, Hengyuan broke free from the effect of the recepts and moved with lightning speed, leaving an afterimage as he charged at Monk Jingchen.

Hengyuan was furious and intended to teach this Western sect brother a lesson.

At that moment, a figure stepped in front of Jingchen. It was a young, handsome monk in azure robes—Monk Jingsi.

With a calm expression, Jingsi looked at the approaching Hengyuan and struck out with his palm.

The moment the palm was thrust, there was nothing unusual, but during the movement, a mote of golden lacquer spread from his palm, quickly covering his hand and arm. In an instant, Jingsi looked like a golden statue.

_Clang!_

Jingsi's palm landed squarely on Hengyuan's chest. Hengyuan, as if struck by a battering ram, was sent flying, smashing through the courtyard wall and crashing into the main building's walls.

The station's staff were terrified, trembling and hiding in their rooms, not daring to come out. These monks had just moved in, and they were already fighting someone. If this continued, wouldn't they tear the place down?

_Cough, cough..._

Amidst pained coughing, Hengyuan emerged, staring at Jingsi without saying a word.

Jingchen said indifferently, "You will stay in the station. When Uncle Du'e returns, he will have questions for you."

Hengyuan nodded. "Very well."

Just as the word "well" was uttered, Hengyuan once again became an afterimage, charging fiercely—this time, not at Jingchen, but at Jingsi.

The golden-hued Jingsi raised his palm again to strike Hengyuan, but this time Hengyuan intercepted his arm, and his fist, as large as a clay pot, hammered repeatedly at Jingsi's face, producing a resounding "clang, clang, clang."

Staggered by the blows, Jingsi responded with a headbutt, forcing Hengyuan back. The two exchanged more than a dozen rapid blows before Hengyuan once again gained the upper hand.

Grabbing Jingsi's wrist, Hengyuan roared and performed an over-the-shoulder throw, smashing Jingsi into the ground.

_Boom!_

The flagstones in the courtyard erupted, launching into the air, as the ground cracked open.

Hengyuan knelt, pressing his knee against Jingsi's throat, and began pummeling his head with a flurry of punches.

_Clang, clang, clang..._

The sounds echoed like temple bells, accompanied by gusts of air, wreaking havoc across the courtyard. Tiles shattered, flowerbeds exploded, and willow trees snapped—chaos ensued.

Jingsi, unable to resist, could only cover his face and endure the relentless beating.

"That's enough!" Jingchen commanded.

Only then did Hengyuan stop, shaking off his bloodied fist and glaring coldly at Jingsi. "Thick skin, that's all."

Finally, the warrior monk's fiery temper had subsided.

Xu Qi'an had always misunderstood Hengyuan, thinking he was a simple and gentle "Lu Zhishen," when in fact, Hengyuan was a brute wrapped in a gentle and honest exterior.

Only someone with a fierce temper could storm into the Pingyuan Earl's mansion at night, kill everyone inside, and walk away without a care in the world.

However, in Hengyuan's mind, Sir Xu was a kind and charitable man—a good person who deserved to be treated with gentleness.

After entering the station, Hengyuan had faced hostility at every turn. He had come with goodwill, only to be met with aggression. His anger had been simmering, and this young monk had dared to act superior, as if Hengyuan were a mere weakling. 

But in the end, Jingsi was just a monk with thick skin.

…

Just past three PM, the early spring sun hung lazily in the western sky.

Master Du'e, holding a monk's staff and draped in a gold and red kasaya, strolled leisurely back to the courier station. He paused for a moment at the entrance before stepping inside and making his way to the inner courtyard.

The courtyard was a mess. The station workers were on ladders, laying roof tiles, while the warrior monks were tamping down the cracked ground with soil. Among them, the most industrious one was an unfamiliar bald man. Master Du'e glanced at him a few times but said nothing.

Master Du'e was a gaunt old monk with dark skin, a face full of wrinkles, and a body so withered that he looked comical wrapped in his oversized kasaya.

"Senior Uncle!"

Monk Jingchen came out of the house and began speaking in the language of the Western Regions: "While you were in the palace, something happened..."

He detailed the entire incident involving the two versions of Hengyuan.

"Hengyuan beat Jingsi without giving him a chance to fight back?"

Master Du'e glanced at Hengyuan, who was still working hard.

"Yes," Jingchen nodded, then added, "But Junior Brother Jingsi wasn't hurt. The Vajra Sutra[^1] isn't something just anyone can break through."

There was a hint of pride in his voice.

Master Du'e didn't comment on that, instead asking, "Did the first Hengyuan reveal any information about the evil object? For instance, did he know anything specific about it or its origins?"

Jingchen thought for a moment and shook his head. “He only mentioned that the sealed object under Sangpo was related to the Buddhist sect and, when discussing the case, said he had seen the severed hand possess Junior Brother Henghui.

"Uncle, this matter can be easily verified by questioning the Hengyuan outside."

But Master Du'e asked again, "He truly didn’t reveal anything about the evil object to try and coax you into giving more details?"

Jingchen shook his head again. "No."

Master Du'e hummed in acknowledgment. "I know who he is now. Go to the Nightwatcher Constabulary and find that officer, Xu Qi'an. I have something to ask him."

...

Xu Qi'an emerged from the Goulan brothel feeling light as a feather, his bones practically melting from relaxation. A massage while watching performances and listening to music—it was a life of pure bliss.

In just one hour, the goulan's girls had come and gone in waves, entering with bright smiles and leaving with trembling hands.

*Too bad the girls here specialise in something else and aren't professional masseuses. Their skills could use some work. This era has brothels, the Jiaofangsi, and entertainment districts, but no foot spas or massage parlors. What a shame.*

By this time, his shift was long over. There was no need to return to the constabulary, so Xu Qi'an hired a carriage to head back to Xu Manor.

"You're finally home, Dalang! Someone from the constabulary has been waiting for you here for quite a while. They've already had two pots of tea," Old Zhang, the gatekeeper, greeted him hurriedly.

*The constabulary is looking for me?* Xu Qi'an thought for a moment, guessing it must be someone from the Western Buddhist sect.

When he entered the reception hall, he saw a black-clad clerk sitting on a chair, sipping tea while glancing frequently outside.

"Ah, Sir Xu! You're finally back!"

After countless glances, the clerk was overjoyed to see Xu Qi'an. "If you'd come back any later, I'd have been forced to stay overnight at your manor after the curfew."

"What's the matter?" Xu Qi'an got straight to the point.

"A high monk from the Buddhist sect came to the constabulary looking for you not long ago. Since you weren't there, they went to see Duke Wei. Duke Wei sent me to wait for you here," the officer said.

*It's just a monk—does Wei Yuan really need to treat this so seriously? These Westerners aren't a big deal. When will my Central Plains stand tall again?* Xu Qi'an clenched his teeth in frustration but kept his expression blank. "Understood, I’ll go see him shortly."

The Nightwatchers clerk sighed in relief, ready to take his leave. Suddenly, he remembered something and smiled. "By the way, Duke Wei heard you've been out gallivanting lately instead of ready at the constabulary or patrolling the streets. He’s quite angry and said your salary for the next three months is gone."

*...Dad, we can talk about this!* Xu Qi'an's face stiffened.

After seeing the clerk off, Xu Qi'an remembered that his horse was still at the Nightwatcher Constabulary, so he instructed a servant to fetch Xu Erlang’s horse for him.

The Xu Manor had three horses—one each for Xu Pingzhi, Xu Qi'an, and Xu Xinnian. There was also a carriage for the women of the household.

Xu Xinnian, having heard his older brother had returned, rushed out of his study with a worried look. "Elder Brother, after you left today, those two shady characters came again."

"What?" Xu Qi'an was confused for a moment.

"A swordsman in azure robes and a monk who looks more like a butcher. They showed up uninvited to congratulate us. Father said guests should be treated kindly, so he invited them in for wine."

Xu Xinnian frowned. "I couldn't help but feel the way they looked at me was strange."

Xu Qi'an suddenly recalled that Hengyuan had mentioned earlier he had just come from the Xu Manor after a drink.

"Erlang, don't bother with such nobodies. You’re the huiyuan now—your vision should be set on greater heights." Xu Qi'an wasn't quite sure how to comfort his little brother, so he patted him on the shoulder. "I need to borrow your horse for a bit. I'll bring it back tomorrow."

Just then, a servant led the horse to the front gate. Xu Qi'an mounted up and left swiftly.

By the time he arrived at Sanyang Station, the sun was already setting, casting a magnificent red-gold glow across the horizon.

"You..."

The two monks guarding the gate felt deceived. They glared at Xu Qi’an with open hostility.

"I’m Xu Qi'an, the officer in charge of the Sangpo case. Master Du'e summoned me. Lead the way." Xu Qi'an smiled as he handed over the reins.

Suppressing their anger, one monk took the reins, while the other gestured for him to enter.

Following the gatekeepers, Xu Qi'an was led into the inner courtyard.

*Looks like there was a fight here… and Hengyuan’s here working. I’m so sorry Master Hengyuan, I promise, I’ll be a good person from now on.*

He lowered his head in shame, not daring to look at Hengyuan. Under the guidance of the monks, he entered a room. There were three monks in that room, the one in the centre sat on the armchair was a dark-skinned old monk, with a face full of wrinkles, and a body so thin that it looked comical under his oversized kasaya.

Left and right of him were Jingchen and Jingsi, all familiar faces.

Jingchen looked at Xu Qi’an with an unfriendly gaze.

“Master Du’e!” Xu Qi’an clasped his hands together in the buddhist style, and bade his regards.

The old monk bowed back, and said warmly: “Sir Xu, why did you impersonate Hengyuan, a monk from Qinglong Temple?”

Xu Qi’an replied with utmost sincerity: “I wanted to find out what was sealed under Sangpo Lake.”

The old monk narrowed his eyes, silently watching him. His calm, gentle gaze seemed to penetrate deeply, as if he were scanning Xu's inner being.

In front of this monk, Xu Qi’an dared not let his thoughts run wild. He calmed his mind and spoke again:

“The Sangpo case was one that I personally investigated. I discovered many secrets, including that the Yongzhen Shanhe Temple was built upon a great formation, and something evil was sealed within it. After the explosion at the temple, the evil escaped. I personally dove into the lake to investigate and found that the remaining pillars of the formation had Buddhist inscriptions.

“At first, I thought the thing sealed under Sangpo was the former Jianzheng, but as the case progressed and Henghui appeared, I realised the thing sealed was a severed hand.”

“I deduced that the severed hand was related to the Buddhist House. However, neither the Jianzheng nor the royal family were willing to speak openly about this matter.

“I, Xu Qi’an, have solved many major cases in the capital, and there is no mystery I cannot uncover. But this matter has become a thorn in my side, keeping me awake at night.”

Master Du'e slowly nodded. “So that was the reason for your earlier test?”

“Exactly,” Xu Qi’an replied.

This explanation was something he had prepared when impersonating Hengyuan. He portrayed himself as a ‘madman’ obsessed with solving the mystery, losing sleep over the severed hand’s origins and the secrets behind it. That’s why he pretended to be Hengyuan when the Western Buddhist delegation arrived.

His actions made sense — all of his inquiries were cautiously phrased, never revealing any information about the monk Shenshu, portraying himself as a lead investigator who only knew half of the story.

Master Du'e smiled gently. “Do you wish to know more about the evil creature?”

Xu Qi’an’s heart leaped with joy, and he allowed a hint of curiosity to show. “Would the master be willing to tell me?”

The emaciated monk smiled. “I could, but only if you join our Buddhist order and become my disciple.”

*Get lost...* Xu Qi’an's face twitched slightly as he shook his head. “This official is a martial artist, and so cannot follow the Buddhist heart.”

Master Du'e seemed to have anticipated this response. He said calmly, “You could become a warrior monk.”

*A warrior monk... So my guess was correct,* thought Xu Qi’an. The Buddhist sect’s warrior monk system was designed for ‘outer disciples,’ confirming his long-held suspicion.

What is the next rank after an eighth-rank warrior monk?

“Can warrior monks marry and have children?” Xu asked.

“Though warrior monks are not bound by the precepts, they cannot marry or have children. It’s not a matter of cultivation but a rule of the Buddhist order,” Master Du'e replied, shaking his head. “Once you enter the Buddhist path, you are considered a monk, and no monk may start a family.”

Xu Qi’an put on a look of regret. “I greatly admire the Buddhist path, but alas, I am the only heir in my family for nine generations... It seems I have no fate with Buddhism. What a great regret.”

Master Du'e was visibly pleased, not expecting Xu Qi’an to show such friendliness toward Buddhism.

“If Sir Xu ever has any questions, feel free to visit the station and ask. I will tell you what I can. There is no need to disguise yourself as a Buddhist monk.”

“This official apologises for his previous transgression.” Xu Qi’an said.

Master Du'e nodded and instructed Jingsi to see him out.

Once Jingsi had returned after escorting Xu Qi’an out, Master Du'e said gravely, “Summon Hengyuan.”

“Yes!” Jing Chen went outside to fetch him.

Before long, Hengyuan, covered in dust, returned with Jing Chen. Master Du’e smiled and said, “Panshu calls me uncle, so you, as his disciple, may call me grand-uncle.”

In truth, there was no hierarchical connection between the Western Buddhist order and Qinglong Temple, but out of courtesy, Jing Chen had earlier referred to Xu as a junior brother.

“Grand-Uncle,” Hengyuan greeted, clasping his hands together.

Master Du’e nodded and asked, “I heard from Jing Chen that the Silver Gong, Xu Qi’an, claimed to be close friends with you?”

Hengyuan replied, “Yes.”

“And despite the misunderstandings caused by this man, you bear no grudge against him?” Master Du’e asked, fixing Hengyuan with a penetrating gaze.

“No matter what Sir Xu does, this disciple can always forgive and understand him,” Hengyuan replied.

He owed Number Three two lives and Xu Qi’an one life — a great debt of gratitude.

Master Du'e nodded again. “What kind of man is he?”
