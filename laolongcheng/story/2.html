        # 二，玉碎

        青烟袅袅，缭绕在陈设豪华的屋子里。外面风啸沙飞，如成千上万的小敌军，无处不侵。窗户、房门都紧闭着，但在汹涌的沙暴中震颤不已，似乎随机都会被狂风拆开，随机都会败于风沙大军。
        
        屋子里的气氛沉闷，小阿丽缩在软榻上，无精打采地捧着一本蓝皮书，翻来翻去，心不在焉。老道士坐在窗边，望着外面的飞沙，时不时吹烟圈，沉默不语。至今，又过了五个月。在这期间，姜老道士赠了她一本道门修行功法，说是一种基础的炼气功法，书上以中原古篆书写了两个字：「辰星」。阿丽曾经问过老道士这本书上为什么写了辰星这两个字，他只说不必在意，看便可，也可以用之学些中原文字，以及些太川官话。
        
        因此，她就跟着姜道士读，一方面识这些极其复杂的文字，另一方面研究一下中原的「修行」道理。沙漠上的炼法士，是以炼金术与外游实习来磨炼法力，但没有任何打坐吐呐灵气等这种做法。虽然前者对提升自身的法力快了许多，但后者的成就远胜前者；直接吸收天地灵气，可以精炼自己的法力灵性，然每晋级，变化甚大。
        
        姜道士说阿丽的灵属属火属水，余三者缺或极弱，这虽然对她能修行的法道有所限制，但如果能修，必定一日千里。她自己也觉得，这种东方的炼法道，不算太困难，然若真能让她打败比她高两三品的法士，还是很值得。所以时不时宫里的丫鬟们会无意中进屋，发现一只九尺铜龙坐在圆毯上，双爪合十，闭目打坐。
        
        这样子她较欢快地过了这五个月，不太忧郁，但今日，恶信终至。两天前，一阵沙尘暴骤然而起，肆虐了全瓦叁京，持续至今，而在这个沙灾中，一位极其狼狈的骑兵赶到京城入宫，传来一封飞凤信，瓦叁最紧急的信息级。
        
        此信说，瓦叁国最西的大城，卧木来，已陷落。阿费塔不知何时出现两位三品法士、两位四品武士，成功破城，击退瓦叁军。阿苏王在战中受伤，军队折损了三成。今瓦叁军在关中阿兰漫木堡扎寨。
        
        闻此恶事，阿丽惊呆了，长时无语。姜道士也没办法可以安慰她了，因为他自己也知道，今日的局势，对瓦叁帮来说，九死一生。两名四品武夫，两名三品法士。瓦叁军中最强的人物，只是两名四品将军，以及阿苏王。但龙归龙，安能打破世间真正的高手呢？也不是海龙族，天龙族终究属凡，他们也只有那么一条，只能堪堪平局而已。
        
        「姜叔叔……」阿丽小声说。
        
        「小公主。」姜道士回答，语气沉重。
        
        「我们该怎么办呀？」
        
        老道士长时不答。终于，「不瞒小公主，瓦叁邦现在九死一生。若在千钧一发中获胜，就无忧。但若败……小公主，我只能带你奔中原，过几百年后，你的修为大成，回来守回故土，灭阿费塔。」
        
        她张开了嘴巴，又闭上了，许久说不出话，不知如何回答。「那……那……我爹……」她终于挤出来。
        
        「你便打坐即可。多虑此事，对你的心状不好。我看你再修行一两月，便可以突破瓶颈，正式进入炼气。到时候，再看。小公主，一步一步行。」
        
        ……
        
        三月过。在此期间，阿丽终于领悟一些奥秘，掌握了一些基础法术，如火弹、幻化、冰锥等，一些小型攻击术，总比用自己四爪獠牙龙火厮杀更省事。
        
        三月过，名义到了冬季，但在广阔的沙漠中，冬与他季没有什么大区别，就是冷了一点，夜晚的温度终于降到冰点以下，早上瓦叁京内的数个大绿洲都结了薄薄一层冰。远处的山顶上也落了一层薄雪。
        
        在这个冬季，阿兰漫木破。
        
        阿苏王元气大损，他的军队也只有巅峰时三四成的实力。但阿费塔国也付出不少的代价，一万多士兵陨落，一位四品武士也随之而亡，被阿苏王亲自撕成粉碎。
        
        但瓦叁军日日被击退，已经离京城不过八九皇沙里，差不多一百七十里左右。又有一封飞凤信传到，阿丽公主的担忧和恐惧又加强了几分。她毕竟未成年，还是个孩子，也没有其他兄弟姐妹，母亲在几十年前去世，只有父亲阿苏，以及这位姜老师。若她失去了交亲，她就失去了最大的一座靠山。阿丽觉得自己无比渺小，无比孤独，姜道士也无能为力。
        
        因为无法平息心境，阿丽的修行也无法进步，她天天站在瞭望台上，望向西方，白嫩的脸颊紧皱。姜道士默默跟着她，又手倒背，同样望向西方，但面无表情。
        
        ……
        
        一旬有五。
        
        噹，噹，噹，来大钟凄凉的声音。在城外数里，两军互相厮杀，低空中一只巨大铜龙飞着，对抗着两位身穿金边黑袍，一人双手舞雷电，一人双手舞魔气，正左右跳，同时施展凶猛了法术，逼着铜龙时不时仰身后撤。那只铜龙的双翼已千疮百孔，身体遍布旧伤，但仍略占上风。
        
        正是阿苏王。
        
        城外的战争已持续了一个多小时，瓦叁军渐渐被推往城墙，而今，只剩下了三四千人，敌军反而有近万。
        
        阿丽远方看着，要帮她爹杀敌，但被姜道士拦住了。她心里也知道，如果她真要去，必死无疑，这个夕天血脉就此断绝。姜道士的左手中握着一把剑，仍在鞘里。这把剑，阿丽还是从未见过的，但一见之就知道此剑不凡，是法器。姜老师今拿着剑，说明他也很不安心。
        
        此时，离城墙不到一里，突然一位武士跃上天空，缭绕紫芒的长矛刺向阿苏王。他不得不转身应对，但就在此时，一位黑袍法士突然指着阿苏王，口中念了一个词。阿苏的身体抽搐，吐出一大口精血，动作停顿了一息。
        
        紫矛中的。
        
        「不好！」
        
        「爹！」
        
        姜道士与阿丽同时失声。鲜红龙血溅数丈高。阿苏怒吼，口中喷出火河，吞没武夫。另一位黑袍法士舞手念咒，施放出一道粗雷弧，打在阿苏的脖颈上。武夫被火烧成灰烬，阿苏坠落到地，生息全无。 
        
        玉碎。
        
        阿丽瞬息化龙，从瞭望台上跃起，但姜道士一手抓着她的前爪，组织了她。这个老道士有如此大的潜力，让阿丽一时惊讶，没有立刻起飞。姜道士左手的剑自动出鞘，他本人面色凝重踩上剑，半拉着阿丽往东北方向开始飞。
        
        阿丽试图挣脱姜道士，却发现他的握力异常强，被拉着往东奔。泪水从她的目中溢出，在风中飞散。
        
        「夕天阿丽，」姜道士沉稳地说道，声音不大，但仍清晰异常，「没用了。瓦叁虽亡，但夕天族仍存。先保命，无命哀何用？今你死，不亦冤枉乎？」
        
        在他们后面，瓦叁军渐渐被散，被杀，城中驻军见国王死，士气全无。
        
        突然，轰隆隆巨响，一只魔蟒冲天，冲向阿丽等人，背上乘坐着两位黑袍人。他们的速度极快，比姜道士的飞剑还要快一筹，老道士不得不停下，在半空中缓缓回身，望向那两位三品法士。
        
        三品，虽然法力耗了一半，但仍比姜道士高六个品级，不容小瞧。
        
        黑气魔蟒停于老道士前，相隔十来丈，一个黑袍人以嘶哑的阿费塔方言说道：「老头子，把那只小孽畜交过来，我们就让你自行离开这里。」
        
        姜道士哂笑了一声，以皇沙语回答：「呵，贫道有任，保护小公主。你若欲试我，贫道就让你领教一下我们上古中原道法！」
        
        「那你便找死！」
        
        另一位黑袍人射出一道魔光，激射而去，但姜道士的丹田中忽然金光亮起，那道魔光离他一丈远时如泥牛入海，无声无息地消散。姜道士双手合十，闭目说道：「无效！」
        
        说完，他开始以中原某种咒语念咒。阿丽突然觉得附近虚空暗藏阴险，若龙能出汗，就已经冷汗淋淋。黑袍人们也意识到了，一时有些不知所措。姜道士的气息突然膨胀， 周围的灵气如漩涡般冲入他体内。他又睁开眼睛，瞳孔中闪着蓝芒，周围三十丈浮现道道剑气， 森然逼人。黑袍人也见势不妙，没料到这个外地人，虽看进来不过八九品的样子，却有如此恐怖的力量。他们试图跳，却晚了。
        
        「剑雨。」姜道士说出这两个中原字，成千上万的剑气一窝蜂般激射而去，瞬间至黑袍人。他们未来得及施展破法，前方的魔法士已被千疮百孔，当场丧命。后面的只能以雷电打散大多的剑气而逃跑，仍受大伤，但性命还保着。
        
        姜道士的气息迅速枯萎，他的身躯突然颤抖，摇摇欲坠。「小公主……」他孱弱地说，然后跌倒。
        
        「姜叔叔！」阿丽尖叫，前爪抓向老道士，抓住了他。他并没有昏过去，但气息衰弱之极。深吸了口气，他小声道：「东飞，东飞！」

        # 2. Like Broken Jade

        Grey smoke rose, spiralling around a luxuriously decorated room. Outside the wind howled and sand roared through the air, like tens of thousands of little soldiers, attempting to destroy everything in their path. The windows and doors were tightly shut, but in the ferocious sandstorm they shook terribly, as if at any time they could be shattered by the wind, broken down.
        
        The atmosphere in the room was heavy, Alyr was curled up on the couch, listelessly ruffling through a blue-cover book, thoughts elsewhere. The old Daoist priest stood by the window silently, looking outside at the swirling sands, occasionally blowing smoke circles. 
        
        It had been five months. 
        
        In these five months, Jiang the priest had given Alyr a Daoist cultivation book, explaining that it is a basic self-cultivation path. On the book cover itself, in old Seal Script of the central plains, was written two characters, *Chen Xing*; Constellations and Stars. Alyr had asked the old priest why those two characters specifically were written, but he just told her not to worry about it, just read it, and simultaneously learn some of the writing of the Central Plains, and the spoken language of the Mandarins, of Taichuan province. 
        
        Thus, she read with old Jiang, both learning the devilishly intricate and complex writing of the central plains, and looking into the theory of their "cultivation". The mages of the deserts, use alchemy, and experience out in the wilderness to build upon their magic, yet lacked any sense of meditiation excersises, absorbing the primordial magic aura all around. Though the former can increase one's magic quickly, the latter's achievements at every step far outmatched the former; to directly absorb primordial magic, can refine one's spirit, and thus every time one were to gain a rank, their transformation would be monumental.
        
        Daoist Jiang had said that Alyr's spirit roots are rooted in fire and water, with the other three missing or extremely weak. Whilst this may limit what cultivations she could study, but should she be able to, she would progress at tremendous pace, a thousand *li* a day. Alyr herself thought that this cultivation was not as difficult as made out to be, and if it would allow her to beat mages up to three ranks more powerful, was most definitely worth the effort. Thus, in those months, occasionally a servant maid would enter a room, only to find a nine foot tall bronze dragon sat on a circular mat, foreclaws together in meditation. 
        
        Like this, she lived through these months relatively content, but this day, bad omen finally came knocking. Two days ago, a sandstorm suddenly rose, wreaking havoc on the capital of Wasan, unceasing until today. Within this howl of sand, an incredibly tired, battered, travel worn soldier entered the palace, bringing with him a "flying phoenix" message, the highest and most urgent rank of royal message in Wasan. 
        
        This message said that the westernmost large city of Wasan, Omorai, was lost. From the ranks of Al Fitah had appeared two third rank mages, and two fourth rank warriors, and with them they overran the city, beating back the Wasan army. King Assur was hurt, and three-tenths of his men were lost. Up to the present, the army was held at Alan Manmur, high in the mountain pass. 
        
        Upon hearing this, Alyr was stunned speechless for a long while. Daoist Jiang could not comfort her in any way, because he himself knew, that with the situation now, Wasan is in a life or death situation, with death closer to the door. 
        
        Two fourth-rank warriors, two third-rank mages. The strongest of the strong in Wasan's troops were two fourth-rank generals, and of course, King Assur. But though a dragon is a dragon, how could he compete against that? It's not as if Assur was a Calamity; at the end of the day, he was still mortal, and there was only one of him, they could only ever maintain stalemate. 
        
        "Uncle Jiang..." Alyr whispered.
        
        "Young Princess." Jiang replied, with a heavy voice. 
        
        "What do we do?"
        
        Jiang did not reply. A long time later, "To tell the truth, Wasan is facing total defeat, our chance of success is perhaps... one in ten. If we were to overcome this imminent peril, then nothing much needs to be done, but if not... young Princess, I could only take you and flee to the central plains. After a few centures, when your cultivation is complete, you'll return and take back your country, and lay waste to all Al Fitah."
        
        She opened her mouth, as if to speak, but closed it again, silent, not knowing how to respond. "But... but... father..." she managed to squeeze out.
        
        "Go meditate. If you think about these things too much, it will only worsen your mental state. After another month or two, you'll surpass your barrier, and properly enter the stage of refining qi. Then, we'll see. Young princess, one step at a time."
        
        ...
        
        Three months pass. In this time, Alyr finally grasped some fundamental secret, and finally was able to control some basic Daoist magic, like fireballs, ice spikes, illusions, some basic offensive spells sure, but still better than using one's own claws, teeth and fire to battle it out.
        
        Three months pass, and autumn turns to winter, though in this wide expansive desert, winter did not change much from other seasons. It was only a bit colder, the night finally dipping below freezing, freezing a thin layer of ice on the many oases within Wasan city. Far in the distance, on the mountains, a thin layer of snow fell. 
        
        In this winter, Alan Manmur fell.
        
        King Assur was badly hurt, and his troops were now no more than a third of their original fighting strength, yet Al Fitah also gave heavily, losing ten thousand men, and one of their fourth rank fighters, who was personally torn apart by Assur in brutal melee. 
        
        The troops of Wasan were beaten back day by day, and now were no more than ninety miles from the capital - roughly a hundred and seventy *li*. As another flying phoenix letter arrived, Alyr's worry and fright worsened. 
        
        After all, she was not of age, and did not have any brothers or sisters. Her mother passed away decades ago, thus she was only left with her father Assur, and this old priest. Losing her father would be like losing the largest mountain, losing that steadfastness and stability. In this moment, Alyr felt unimaginably small, and alone. Jiang also, was helpless.
        
        Since she couldn't calm her heart, she could no longer cultivate well. Every day, she would stand on the balcony, looking westwards, her delicate features scrunched up in worry. Daoist Jiang would stand behind her, silently, hands behind his back, also looking westwards, emotionless.
        
        ...
        
        Fifteen days pass.
        
        Dong! Dong! Dong! came the melancholic sound of the bell, as a few miles from the city, the two armies clashed. Low to the ground a bronze dragon flew, fighting two gold-hemmed black-cloaked figures, one wielding lightning, one wielding black demonic energy, darting to and fro, ocassionally attacking with ferocious magic, forcing the dragon to rise and dodge. The dragon's wings were tattered and full of small holes, his body covered in old injuries, yet still, he just about held the upper hand. 
        
        Assur Khitaan, King of Wasan. 
        
        The fighting outside the city had gone on for just over an hour, and the troops of Wasan were slowly pushed back towards the city walls, all three or four thousand of them that were left, that is. The enemy numbered over ten thousand. 
        
        Alyr watched from afar, wanting desparately to help her father, and tear these enemy soldiers apart, but was held back by Jiang. In her heart though, she knew that if she really were to go join the frey, she would be slain, without doubt, and the House of Khitaan would end with her. 
        
        In Jiang's left hand he clutched a sword in its scabbard. Alyr had never seen this sword before, but one look and she could tell it was special, that it imbued with magic. The fact that Daoist Jiang would carry such a sword, showed his deep worry. 
        
        Not more than half a mile from the city wall, suddenly a warrior lept up, a spear covered with purple light in his hand, striking towards Assur. He could not but turn to avoid, but at this moment, one of the black cloaks raised his hand, pointing a finger towards Assur, and spoke one word. Assur's body twitched violently, as he coughed up a large mouthful of searing blood, as his movements paused for but one breath-
        
        The spear found its target.
        
        "No!"
        
        "Father!"
        
        Both Jiang and Alyr shouted out. Crimson red dragon blood arced up many dozens of feet tall. Roaring in fury, Assur opened his mouth, and spewed a river of fire towards the warrior, engulfing him in golden flame. The other black-cloak chanted a spell, and threw a thick bolt of lighting towards him, striking Assur on the neck. The warrior turned to ash, and Assur fell to the ground, all life gone from his body.
        
        Like a piece of broken jade, to die gloriously in battle.
        
        In an instant Alyr transformed into a dragon, making to leap from the balcony, but Daoist Jiang grabbed her foreleg, stopping her in her tracks. His sudden strength was such, that it shook Alyr for a moment, and she did not immediately take flight. The sword in Jiang's left hand left its scabbard of its own voilition, as he with a solemn expression stepped onto it, and pulled Alyr along, flying eastwards. 
        
        She wanted to pull away, yet he, an old withered priest, was still too strong, and could not but be pulled along. Tears flew from her eyes, and scattered in the wind. 
        
        "Alyr Khitaan," Jiang said calmly, his voice not loud, but still heard clearly over the rushing wind, "There's no use. Though Wasan may have fallen, the House Khitaan still stands. Live, Alyr, as without a life, what use is grief? If you die today, what a great wrong it would be?"
        
        Behind them, the army of Wasan was scattered, massacred, morale vanishing, like fog on the wind. 
        
        Suddenly they heard a large rumble, as a demonic serpent rose into the sky, arcing towards Alyr. On its back stood the two black-cloaked men. Their speed was so fast, that Jiang's flying sword could not compete, and the old Daoist could not but stop, and turn around to face these foes. 
        
        Third rank. Though half their magic used, still they were more powerful than Jiang by a full six ranks, nothing to underestimate. 
        
        The black-smoke demonic serpent stopped some dozen *zhang*[^1] away, as one of the black-cloaks spoke, with a hoarse and grating voice, "Old man, hand that beast over, and we'll let you leave of your own accord."
        
        Daoist Jiang merely sneered, and replied in the Huangsha language "Hah. This poor daoist has a duty to protect the Young Pricess. If you want to try me, I will have to let you experience our ancient Daoist magic!"
        
        "Go kill yourself!"
        
        The other black-cloak threw out a beam of demonic light, as it streaked towards the Daoist, but from Jiang's abdomen suddenly flashed a golden light, and that demonic beam, upon reaching no more than a few feet away, dissolved into thin air, without a sound. He put together his hands, eyes closed, and said: "No effect!"
        
        Immediately after, he started a chant, an incantation of some magic from the central plains. Alyr suddenly felt that the air around her was full of danger. If dragons could sweat, her back would be soaked cold sweat. 
        
        The black-cloaks also realised that something was not right, but for a time seemed to be caught off-guard. Jiang's magical aura suddenly exploded, as the surrounding primoridial aura like a whirlpool rushed into his body. As he opened his eyes, a blue light danced around his pupils, and in a radius of thirty *zhang* appeared hundred of blades of pure qi, so sharp that one dares not look straight at it. The black-cloaks could see that they were in grave danger, and though the old man was merely ninth or eight rank, he nonetheless had a frightening power, and made to flee. 
        
        Yet they were too late.
        
        "Sword rain." as Daoist Jiang intoned two words, the hundreds and thousands of qi blades like a swarm of angry hornets rushed towards them, and in an instant appeared in front of them. The black-cloaks did not have enough time to try counter the spell, and the demonic mage in front was instantly riddled with wounds, dying right then and there. The one behind retreated, desperately using his lightning to shatter some of the swords, but still was badly hurt, and only barely manged to escape with his life. 
        
        Daoist Jiang's aura quickly withered, as his body shook, as if to fall. "Young princes..." he said weakly, before falling from his blade. 
        
        "Uncle Jiang!" Alyr shouted, claws grabbing at him, managing to catch him in mid-air. Though he was still conscious, his energy was weaker than weak. Taking a deep breath, he quitely urged: "Fly east! Fly east!"
        
        [^1]: one *zhang* is twelve feet, roughly 3.3 metres
