        # 一、三家

        青烟袅袅，缭绕在一间陈设豪华的屋子里，外面夏天的干风漂浮在万里沙漠上，逍遥自在。一位蓝衣道士似的老者把一个烟杆轻轻放到桌子上，对一个模样不过十四五岁的小女孩和蔼地笑了一笑。女孩趴在一个软榻上，侧着头，枕着一个丝垫子，似乎在听故事。
        
        「小公主，」那位老道士开口缓缓道，「说龙族之传说啊，话说安神生三龙脉，谓天、地、海。天族，就是公主你们家，似狻猊之体，琉璃鳞甲，四肢双翼蛟首长尾，年少则数尺，年长则数十丈，一生千年。分为十大派，每派的鳞甲拥有不同的色彩，但这些，小公主必然知晓。」
        
        女孩子点头，虎珀色眸子望向老道士，问道：「那地和海呢？」
        
        老道士吸了一口烟，悠悠吐出，吹了个烟圈儿，才继续讲，「地族，我们中原人谓之阴龙，体似巨蟒，有四肢，四爪，居住深渊，可以任由在熔岩中游来游去，算三族中弱者吧。海族呢……在中原，我们古籍中称之『天劫族』。长达百丈的庞大蛟龙，四肢五爪，不翼而可飞，自由游天，寿元与天地慢长，不衰，只强，可以挥舞天地之法，天生而能使雷电暴雨，随意降天劫，因有其名。有话说，一龙占一海，一海无二龙。半步神矣！」
        
        女孩瞪大眼睛，「啊？那么强呀？姜老师，您……您见过吗？」
        
        老道士呵呵笑，笑着俯身，揉了揉小女孩的头，道：「小公主啊，贫道已经在你父亲的城中居住了几年了，不必生疏，不教课，就叫我姜叔叔吧。」
        
        「那……姜叔叔，您见过这些『天劫』龙吗？」
        
        「呵呵，阿丽公主，贫道这个小人物，不可能见到这种传说中的神仙人物，甚至在我们中原上，应该无人真正能睹到一条蛟龙的。并且，不是什么好事！他们叫天劫族， 是有原因的！当然，我姜家有位老祖宗，他主在比中原更遥远的地方，谓世间巅峰人物，没准，他曾经远方见过一条蛟龙，在深海处游。」
        
        阿丽小女子的眼睛瞪得圆溜溜的，口中满是惊讶羡慕，「啊？真的吗？那姜叔叔您的老爷爷可是多么强大呦！」
        
        老道士点点头，「很强很强。如果有些闲时，我可以问你爹能否带你往东方游历一趟，咳……」气氛蓦然沉了下去，长时间无话声。阿丽的脸渐渐黯淡下去，变得如一个胆怯的小小孩。
        
        很长时间后，阿丽小声说：「姜叔叔，爹会赢吗？他们打了这么多月……」
        
        姜道士叹了口气，又柔了柔女孩的头，以示安慰。「小公主，阿苏王如此强，谓你们夕天氏这几千年来的一位顶阶存在……但实不相瞒，现在战势不妙，敌军重重，这个小小的瓦叁邦仍难以保命。幸亏阿费塔未派高手参战。龙之强，仍不及数名三四品的法士，虽然他们远不如我中原修士。」
        
        阿丽并不觉得安慰，但老道士说的话，让她想起来了其他事。「姜叔叔啊，」她开口问道，「您老是说中原这些『修士』这么强大，比我们法师强得多，那是到底多强？」
        
        老道士许久咀嚼了这个问体，终于慢慢说：「尽人皆知，西边的皇沙，伟大的圣阳缠麻帝国，有四位一品护法，护住帝王，但我跟你说呀，那四位一品巅峰，打不过我中原一个渡劫期——就是二品的修士。」
        
        「那么夸张……那姜叔叔您呢？哦，也说这些奇怪的名字是什么，我听您无意中提过几次这些品级，但您以前跟我说不重要，但似乎很重要呀。」
        
        老道士点下头，「这些名字，对你们炼法士来说，的确不重要，因为它们主要是划分我们道门修士的境界。看小公主真好奇，老头子就说说便是。我们中原道家的炼法就叫修炼，但与你们的法士不同，修炼之道异常艰难，异常缓慢，但获来的好处就是比西方同等级者强个至少数倍。哪能有三四十年内跨二十品级者？升五六个就已经算天才了。不说人族，你们龙族也难以做到。
        
        「又说这些境界呢，你们西方人划分为二十品级，我们中原人划分为五个境界。炼气为底，然后建基、金丹、聚婴、最后是渡劫化神。当然， 这只是我们道门的。其他宗教都有自己的称法，武道亦如此。
        
        「贫道在道家中，是一名金丹初。在你们品级中，也就是九品左右。但是呀，虽然贫道现在只是个枯萎的老教师，比我高三个品级的皇沙法士，我能对抗而并不落下风。」
        
        他说了好一时间，阿丽小女子只听懂一半，那么多古怪名字，并不易翻译到皇沙语，老道士只能以中原话说一次，然后尽力用阿丽能听懂的方法再解释，算是半成功。但对小阿丽而言，最重要的倒是听进去了，就是姜老师这个所谓的金丹初级法士——不，修士，能对抗六品而不落下风。六品在沙漠上如凤毛麟角，但中原那边的九品，金丹，应该不比六品法士常见。如此说，修行之路难矣。
        
        话题讲完，阿丽思绪不由地回到她父亲上，到现在的战争上。他们的瓦叁邦，位于山关，掌控着从东到西的商路，所有欲过山往东方的中原大帝国行，必入瓦叁之领地。西方的诸国们，见瓦叁如此小的邦，占如此重要的道路，都心怀鬼胎，欲攻下此地。可是，瓦叁邦虽小，但极其富裕，军队虽小，但质量极佳。更何况，瓦叁邦自五千年以前被夕天龙族世家统治，而五千年以来，外界大乱，但这夕天氏仍存，而自从圣阳缠麻帝国的衰落，独立已久。
        
        邻国忌惮夕天氏，因不敢妄动，但一年半前，西邻的阿费塔国，还是打上门了。国王夕天阿苏随军西战，留了他的独生女，夕天阿丽，在京城，让她的老师，一位三年前来自极东之地的道教修士，看着她，护着她。
        
        时至今日，十有九月过，仗仍未息，夕天阿苏也渐渐落入下风。

        # 1. The Three Families

        Grey smoke rose, spiralling around a luxuriously decorated room. The dry winds of summer danced outside, over a vast endless desert, at ease with the world. An old, blue-robed Daoist priest gently put down his pipe on a table, and gave a young girl, no more than fourteen or fifteen, a kindly smile. The girl lay on a couch, resting on a silk cushion, head tilted, as if listening to a story. 
        
        "Young princess," that old Taoist priest slowly spoke, "to speak of the legends around the dragons, well, they say that the Goddess Asyr gave birth to three draconic families, we call them the Sky, the Earth, and the Sea. 
        
        "The race of Sky, are like your Highness' family, with a lion's build, with scales that shine like earthenware glaze, four legs, two wings, a serpent head and long tail, not more than a few feet tall when young, but towering over several hundred when grown, over a life of a thousand years.  The Sky race split into ten clans, each clan's scales a different colour, but of course this, my princess, you must already know."
        
        The young girl nodded, amber coloured eyes gazing intently at the old priest, "What about the Earth and the Sea?"
        
        The old priest did not immediately answer, rather raised the pipe to his lips, and took a long puff of smoke, blowing smoke rings in the air, before continuing, "The race of Earth, our people of the Central Plains call them the *Yin* dragons, with a body like a large serpent, four limbs, and four talons a claw. They live in the depths, and swim and play in molten rock, yet, are probably the weakest of the three.
        
        "The race of Sea though ... in the Central Plains, our ancient texts call them the Race of Calamity. A serpent-dragon many thousand feet long, four limbs and five talons a claw, bearing no wings yet capable of flight, swimming through the air with ease. Their lifespans are as long as heaven and earth; they do not get weaker, only stronger. They can wield the primordial magic of the heavens, and are natural born masters of thunder and rain. With a single thought, they can bring down a heavenly calamity, thus, arises their name. A saying goes, 'One dragon rules one sea, one sea holds not two dragons!'"
        
        The young girl's eyes widened in shock, "Ah? That strong? Mister Jiang, have you... have you seen one?"
        
        Laughing the old priest leant over, and ruffled the girl's hair, "My young princess, this poor Daoist has lived in your father's city for several years, there's no need to be formal, out of classes, just call me Uncle Jiang."
        
        "Then... uncle Jiang, have you ever seen a 'Calamity' before?"
        
        "Ah, princess Alyr, this poor daoist is naught but an insignificant figure, how could I ever lay eyes on one of these legendary creatures. I dare say that in our Central Plains, no one has ever really laid eyes on one of those serpent-dragons. Plus, seeing one isn't exactly a good thing! They are called the Calamity for a reason after all! That said, in our Jiang family, we have an old elder, who lives in a place even further than the Central Plains. He is so powerful, that only very few in the world can match him, so who knows, he may have once seen a Calamity, wandering through the deep seas."
        
        The young girl Alyr's eyes widened like two suns, full of awe and admiration, "Really? Then uncle Jiang your old elder must be so so strong!"
        
        Jiang nodded affirmation, "Very very strong. If we have time free, I can ask your dad whether or not I can take you east to travel, aiye..." as he sighs, and the mood in the room suddenly dips with that sound, and there hung a silence dragged on and on. Alyr's face  slowly darkened, becoming listeless, and afraid, like a timid small child, afraid of the night.
        
        Finally, Alyr timidly said, "Uncle Jiang, will dad win? They've fought for so many months..."
        
        The Daoist Jiang sighed again, and again ruffled the girl's hair, almost as if to comfort her, "Princess, our King Assur's strength, rivals the greatest in the many thousand years of your House of Khitaan, but there's no use hiding the truth. The enemy is numerous, and this small Kingdom of Wasan is in immense danger. It is only fortunate, that Al-Fitah has not sent their highest level soldiers. However strong a dragon may be, they still cannot beat several third or fourth rank mages, even if those mages are yet far weaker than the cultivators of the Central Plains."
        
        Though Alyr didn't really feel any better, the old priest's words still piqued her interest, and reminded her of past conversations, "Uncle Jiang, you keep talking about how strong these 'cultivators' of the central plains are, how much stronger they are than our mages, how strong *are* they really?"
        
        Jiang did not immediately respond, thinking over this question for a long time, before finally, he slowly spoke: "Everyone knows, that Huangsha in the west, the mighty Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, has four protectors, all of first rank, that guard the Emperor, but let me tell you, these first rank protectors, could not beat one cultivator of second rank, what we call one that is 'overcoming calamity'."
        
        "That strong..." Alyr breathed, "how about you, Uncle Jiang? Oh, could you also explain what these strange names are, I keep hearing you bring up these names. Before you said they were not important, but as far as I see, they're really important."
        
        Nodding, Jiang explained, "These names, to your magicians, are indeed unimportant, because these names partition the stages of our Daoist cultivation. However, I see that your Highness is curious, so I'll explain them. Our Daoist sect of the central plains calls the practice of magic 'cultivating', however, cultivation is different from your mages' arts, the path of cultivation is unnaturaly difficult, unnaturally slow, but its benefits are far above what your western mages could ever hope for. Yet, how could a cultivator rise twenty full ranks within thirty forty years? To rise six ranks, would be already prodigious, our human race aside, even your draconic race cannot usually meet that standard.
        
        "To speak of these 'boundaries' then, in the west you split the path of magic into twenty ranks, in the east we split into five boundaries: refining *qi*, building foundations, golden core, nascent soul, and finally overcoming heavenly calamity, and apotheosis. Of course, these names are just for our Daoist sect, other sects and schools have their own naming, martial artists included.
        
        "In the Daoist sects, this poor priest would be of the initial golden core stage, roughly around ninth rank. Of course, even if I am just an old withered teacher, I can still fight those Huangsha mages three ranks higher, and not lose."
        
        Though Alyr listened intently, she still could only pick up bits and pieces; so many strange names, and not necessarily easy to translate into her language, however the most important detail she did hear clearly: Uncle Jiang, this "Golden Core" mage- no, cultivator, can fight a sixth rank, and not be at a disadvantage. Sixth rank mages are rarer than rare upon these desert sands, however the ninth ranks of the central plains, the golden core cultivators, must be just as rare, if not moreso. Oh how arduous is the path of cultivation.
        
        As silence fell again, Alyr's thoughts drifted back to her father, to the current war. Their kingdom of Wasan, situated in a mountain pass, controlled the trade routes from east to west, all those wanting to go to the great empire on the central plains, must pass by Wasan. The many states in the west all eyed her small country with ravenous desire, but though Wasan was small, it was not weak, rather its coffers were full, its military well trained, and moreover, for five thousand years, the Dragon House of Khitaan has ruled, and stood as the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax fell around it. 
        
        Their neighbours feared the Khitaans, thus were careful, but a year and a half ago, the western neighbour of Al Fitah, still attacked. King Assur led his soldiers west, and left his only daughter, Alyr Khitaan, in the capital, to be looked after and watched over by her teacher, a priest that arrived in Wasan three years ago from the far far east.
        
        To today, nineteen months have passed, the war has yet to finish, and King Assur is slowly being beaten back...
